Jennifer is a world leader in 3D printing of novel materials, and her lab has some of the most precise 3D printers in the world.<p>You will be the only software developer in the group, and will be responsible for designing tools that keep the printers running, tools that make other researchers designs easier to implement, tools that automate the printing process, and in general any tools you think would make the lab more efficient. You will be a part of world class research, and your work will directly effect the process.<p>You need to be a incredibly self directed person, as you will be the only software developer in the lab. Passion for 3D printing and the ability to work directly with the end users of your software are a must. Experience designing GUIs is preferred.<p>Most of the tools I&#x27;ve built up are in python, so experience there would be a plus. For an example of tools you would be working on, see this github repo:<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jminardi/mecode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jminardi&#x2F;mecode</a><p>For more information contact me at jack @ minardi . org<p>[0]: <a href=\"http://lewisgroup.seas.harvard.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lewisgroup.seas.harvard.edu</a>","time":1417455254,"type":"comment"}
