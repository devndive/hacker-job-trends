Thousands of kids have already signed up to our service.<p>But we not only help young people buy Legos and save for bicycles - we are building an awesome technology team that eliminates legacy code, keeps the bug rate tiny, and stays small and joyful. We are doing this by adopting techniques like pair programming, test-driven development, continuous deployment, and microservices. You can read more about our plan to be awesome on our tech blog <a href=\"http://tech.osper.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.osper.io</a>.<p>We want to meet and work with smart technical folks of all varieties - from server-side devs to sysadmins, mobile coders to testers, security analysts to data crunchers.<p>We are willing to arrange relocation to London for the right candidates. Sorry, we&#x27;re not ready to take on remote team members at this stage.","time":1417459411,"type":"comment"}
