Think of it as a bug tracker for doctors.<p>It&#x27;s hard to believe but doctors are still stuck managing hundreds of patients without proper tools to keep track of critical information. They still use paper to assign tasks between them. In some departments they have an intern walking around with a big whiteboard where they write tasks on it! It&#x27;s illegal for doctors to use email, whatsap or any other good project management tool because it&#x27;s not regulatory compliant with patient data. It&#x27;s also not adapted to their very intense workflow.<p>We&#x27;re a team of 5, recently done YC and raised a good seed round from excellent investors. More importantly, we&#x27;re getting amazing excitement from doctors and ListRunner completely replaced their paper patient list.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a very good front-end developer to join our talented and passionate team.<p>We moving really fast and are looking for someone who likes to move even faster!<p>Please reach me at phzbox @ gmail if you are:<p>- Passionate about web technologies (We use React, Angular, Gulp, and aren&#x27;t afraid to use the best tool to get \nthe job done)<p>- Want to have a real impact on improving healthcare.<p>Learn more at <a href=\"http://www.listrunnerapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.listrunnerapp.com</a>","time":1417464691,"type":"comment"}
