We have some serious (-ly fun!) data and software challenges as we aim to rethink how satellite imagery is accessed and used. Our goal is to image the entire Earth, every day, and democratize access to these data and tools. So far this year, we&#x27;ve launched 71 satellites across 6 rocket launches, with many more slated for next year. We&#x27;re a team of ~100 engineers (software, mechanical, electrical, aero&#x2F;astro, and manufacturing) and business people primarily based in San Francisco, with a small, primarily SRE, team building in San Antonio, and a handful of remotes across the world.<p>Senior Platform&#x2F;Infrastructure Engineer, Platform Team: <a href=\"https://planetlabs.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0lb6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;planetlabs.recruiterbox.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;fk0lb6</a><p>Site Reliability Engineer: <a href=\"https://planetlabs.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0gxf/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;planetlabs.recruiterbox.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;fk0gxf&#x2F;</a><p>Web Developer, Internal Tools: <a href=\"https://planetlabs.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0lbh/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;planetlabs.recruiterbox.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;fk0lbh&#x2F;</a><p>Web Developer, Manufacturing Tools: <a href=\"https://planetlabs.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0nz9/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;planetlabs.recruiterbox.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;fk0nz9&#x2F;</a>","time":1417454048,"type":"comment"}
