ITU has tasked us with building an enterprise grade educational system that meets it&#x27;s needs helps ITU scale as it operates and opens new campuses internationally.<p>While ITU is a largely academic environment, we have a fairly progressive work environment. Most engineers set their own hours, we focus on an agile&#x2F;SCRUM-like iterative workflow, and we&#x27;re firm believers in TDD and code review.<p>We also feel strongly that our most valuable asset is our people, and we invest in them. ITU employees get free access to masters and doctorate level courses and we have a dedicated training budge with additional time for personal enrichment (pet projects, read up on some new tech, etc).<p>If you&#x27;re interested in working with us, know that you do not need to be a rockstar, but you do need to be able and willing to communicate, learn, and collaborate.<p>Contact: Damien Wilson &lt;dwilson@itu.edu&gt;<p>EDIT:<p>Some points I forgot to mention:<p><pre><code>  * We&#x27;re predominantly a rails&#x2F;node shop, but we&#x27;re happy to hire good people with relevant experience in different tech stacks\n  * We are happy to hire remotely, but not for junior positions.
