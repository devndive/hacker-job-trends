Chromebooks in EDU has been an insanely hot market (72% compound annual growth). We&#x27;re the first to market with a solution that helps schools understand how their fleet of devices is being used. We&#x27;ve got a small market share now, but have great product-market fit and a great sales pipeline (10% week&#x2F;week growth).<p>Engineering-wise, we&#x27;re ingesting tens of millions of events per day from hundreds of thousands of devices. We&#x27;re in the process of rebuilding our entire event ingestion pipeline (going from PHP+MySQL to Kinesis+Node&#x2F;KCL+Cassandra+Solr). We&#x27;ve got a team of five engineers (including myself). We&#x27;re all responsible for everything (frontend, backend, database, deployments, everything). We&#x27;re looking for someone who wants to make tremendous impact in the organization - making key engineering decision that will impact the company for years to come. We&#x27;re looking for killer frontend and backend people as well as data scientists (we&#x27;ve got a goldmine of usage data that we haven&#x27;t run any non-trivial analytics on).<p>We&#x27;re Pre-Series-A and profitable! We&#x27;re in the process of raising an A round which will enable us to scale up. If you&#x27;re interested in an early stage startup that&#x27;s positioned well for stable growth, please reach out!<p>Hit us up at jobs@goguardian.com","time":1417454701,"type":"comment"}
