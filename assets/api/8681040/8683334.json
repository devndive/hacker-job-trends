We use 4 to 5 years of transaction history to objectively rank and showcase agents based on their areas of expertise.  Think the skills&#x2F;knowledge to buy a condo in SoMa is different than those needed to sell a single family home in Noe Valley.  We know who does each of those things best.<p>We&#x27;re looking to hire our 3rd engineer.  We&#x27;re have a Ruby&#x2F;Rails stack running on Heroku with a Postgres DB and Redis cache.  We&#x27;ve got a lot of product work, greenfield development (sinatra? React? Backbone?  Let&#x27;s talk about it!), algorithm, API, etc. work to do and we need to hire an experienced full stack developer to help us out.<p>Feel free to reach out to me directly (email in profile) and let&#x27;s talk about how we can work together.","time":1417463906,"type":"comment"}
