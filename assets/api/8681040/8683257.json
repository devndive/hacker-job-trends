What we&#x27;re <i>not</i> building: yet another app.<p>Why work with us?<p>1 - We&#x27;re doing truly ambitious things with the Android platform -- making humans a primitive on the device. The problems are hard and interesting. After all, who wants to work on yet another photo sharing app?<p>2 - You&#x27;re working with founders who have already built and sold a company to Google. If you want to be a founder someday we&#x27;ll teach you everything we know; in fact, 50% of the engineers from our last company are now founders.<p>3 - You get real equity and a real salary. We want everyone to succeed in the case of an exit and we don&#x27;t want anyone to starve while we get there.<p>4 - Everyone at the company is technical and actively writes code. Except the dog. And we&#x27;re trying to teach her :)<p>Email me: helloanish [at] squanda [dot] com","time":1417463328,"type":"comment"}
