They’ve raised money from some of the best investors around the world including YC.<p>We&#x27;re currently focusing on developers who are in the early-stages of their career ranging from recent graduates and PhDs to developers with 4-5 years of real world dev experience. Founders are required to move to London but we’re actively recruiting from across Europe. We’ve also helped founders sort-out visas in the past when they’ve needed them.<p>We&#x27;re especially interested in developers who also have domain expertise that they want to apply to building a startup. Whether thats from academic experience (we’ve had founders turn their doctorates into real world products), personal interest in specific technologies (blockchain, deep-learning, VR, etc.) or from working in a particular field (finance, security, etc).<p>We strongly believe that that we can only succeed by finding the best founders, so if you’re on the fence about applying or have any questions then drop us an email and we’ll help you figure it out.<p><a href=\"http://www.joinef.com/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joinef.com&#x2F;apply</a>","time":1417444343,"type":"comment"}
