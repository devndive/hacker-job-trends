To give an idea of our disrupting potential, our biggest competitor is paper (who remembers spending a few hours filling out your address ten times during company onboarding?).<p>We&#x27;re looking for many roles, most immediately a CTO, and a senior web developer, but we&#x27;re looking to hire all levels of developers, business analysts, account managers, product owners, and probably more (I&#x27;ll update with a more definitive list from HR). If you&#x27;re interested, send a line to help@spotlite.com with your information and we&#x27;ll get in touch. The career listing on our site is getting updated today and tomorrow so there&#x27;s nothing on there right now, but email away.<p>Our stack is ASP.NET MVC, SQL Server and EventStore, RabbitMQ+MassTransit, Jenkins, and Chef to name a few pieces.<p>We offer great benefits (we sell benefits so they&#x27;re kind of a big deal to us), incredible culture (hilarous people and hipchat&#x27;s inline memes help and I don&#x27;t go a week without laughing to tears at least once), and smart, smart people.","time":1417447732,"type":"comment"}
