Our clients rip the benefit of business intelligence, dramatic decrease in update latency (from weeks to minutes), improved accuracy <i>and</i> flexibility, turn-key E-commerce integration, and many more.<p>We&#x27;re looking for driven engineers, ready to take on the vast business problems with their skills, smarts, and commitment.<p>Our server stack is ASP.NET MVC + SQL Server + AWS. The client stack is iOS, Win8, and web. Our web story is still in its infancy (plain ol&#x27; HTML for now), so it can turn any which way yet, but likely React.<p>Contact jobs@amptab.com","time":1417468254,"type":"comment"}
