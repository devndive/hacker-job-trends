We want someone who recognizes that leading an engineering team is more than just running a Scrum process, and can truly drive ownership, accountability and customer focus on the team. To be successful, you need to be comfortable and excited about coding, and able to command the respect of our talented engineering team. You’ll work closely with our Director of Product and CTO to drive decision making and team strategy.<p>A bit more about our product: Right now, millions of knowledge workers wake up every day and open their spreadsheets at consulting firms like McKinsey or VC firms like Sequoia Capital. They manually mine data on the web to determine what companies their clients should be investing in, selling to, etc. Our product dramatically cuts down the time they spend manually researching these companies by aggregating growth signals for hundreds of thousands of private companies. With the right people, we believe Mattermark will become synonymous with deal prospecting, and for many of our customers, it already has.<p>Interested?
