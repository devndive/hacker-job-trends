We believe there&#x27;s a big shift underway in how companies communicate, led by employee mobile phones + SaaS. And we want to be the team that does it right.<p>We&#x27;re backed by awesome investors (Redpoint &amp; Homebrew). Our team is a diverse mix of enterprise and consumer (gaming). We&#x27;re still small so you will have a lot of ownership and impact on both tech and product. (Not to mention meaningful equity). And, since our product pillars are real time messaging &amp; voice, we get to play with fun tech every day.<p>We&#x27;re looking for backend (python&#x2F;flask, node.js, c++), frontend (web, backbone), and VoIP &#x2F; distributed systems engineers.<p>Interested? You can email me: samir@clementine.io<p>Cheers, Samir, CTO &amp; Co-founder\n<a href=\"http://www.clementine.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clementine.io</a>","time":1417454614,"type":"comment"}
