We&#x27;re a non-profit tech company that helps artists make their art while we handle the nitty-gritty.<p>We&#x27;re badly in need of a UI&#x2F;UX-type. We have several different tech products and each one has it&#x27;s own look and feel. As we move along, we&#x27;d like the L&amp;F of those products to converge rather than diverge.<p>We need someone to come in and be the authority on this sort of thing. Create a new Bootstrap theme to unify this stuff. Help us understand why this is good and this is bad.<p>You&#x27;ll have a fair amount of authority and autonomy. Big features start out with prototyping&#x2F;wireframing and this is where you&#x27;ll be a big asset. Work with the biz to refine a feature before it hits the devs and becomes a thrashing boondoggle.<p>This position REQUIRES that you be at least familiar with Ruby and Ruby on Rails. We&#x27;re good at teaching people this stuff (we run a fellowship program that teaches artists to code) but whoever comes in to this position will at least need some foundation to stand on. We&#x27;ll do our best to train up the rest.<p>We offer all sorts of perks like a fun office, fun people to work with, and a management team that is truly willing to listen to feedback and react. A bunch of other stuff too.<p>NYC-based would be fantastic but a lot of us are remote so that might work too.<p>Email me to get in touch: gary.moore@fracturedatlas.org","time":1417449609,"type":"comment"}
