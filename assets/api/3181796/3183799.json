You don't even have to be in the USA.<p>deviantART (<a href=\"http://www.deviantart.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.deviantart.com</a>) wants developers. We're fully remote[1]; there's no central office with a devteam located there. We expect all hires to be comfortable working in PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and SQL; we like our developers to be able to hack on any part of the site, rather than being frontend/backend specialists.<p>One exception to all that: there's an Infrastructure Engineer position which is located in Vancouver. It's C++/Java focused, and involves developing backend services used by the rest of the site.<p>We keep posting this ad because we have some open-ended hiring intended to grow the company. Available developers are currently a bottleneck on the projects we can work on, and we'd like to change that.<p>We post information about our development process here sometimes: <a href=\"http://dt.deviantart.com/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dt.deviantart.com/blog/</a><p>Apply here: <a href=\"http://deviantart.theresumator.com/apply?source=hn\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://deviantart.theresumator.com/apply?source=hn</a><p>[1]: <a href=\"http://dt.deviantart.com/journal/We-re-all-remote-220038037\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dt.deviantart.com/journal/We-re-all-remote-220038037</a>","time":1320176372,"type":"comment"}
