Los Altos, CA (H1B applicants welcome)<p>At Ness we're building a personalized search engine which combines personal data about an individual along with signals from their social graph and delivers uniquely tailored results for each query. Our first product focuses on restaurants and has been featured in the App Store since our launch 8 weeks ago.<p>Behind the scenes we're combining collaborative filtering and other forms of machine learning with traditional information retrieval to predict what users will like, explain our prediction to users, and rank what they will want to do in the moment.<p>Doing all this requires well architected, scalable systems for pushing lots of data and answering queries with minimal latency.<p>I know this is only the broadest possible overview and I'd be happy to talk if you'd like to learn more.
