We're looking to hire a generalist web engineer that will work closely with some big customers to build out new and interesting ways to interact with our system and its data.  Some things you might be working on:<p>- spatially-connected visualizations of our internal sensor data (temp, occupancy, ambient light, and more)\n - learning algorithms that adjust lighting policies to save the most energy without disturbing occupants (very Nest-like)\n - building an application to create lighting patterns that direct occupants to a safe exit within a building<p>As always, we're looking for people who get things done, are interested in new technologies and care about our customers.  Get in touch with me, Matt, via mball .at. redwoodsys.com  And see more of our openings here <a href=\"http://redwoodsystems.com/about-us/careers#job-7\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://redwoodsystems.com/about-us/careers#job-7</a> (the one mentioned above is \"Application Engineer\").","time":1320166925,"type":"comment"}
