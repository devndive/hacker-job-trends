We're a growing agency that has some of the best mobiel and web developers in Baltimore. We've worked on interesting projects for Dell, Geico and other clients. We're currently growing really fast and need to add people to our team in the next six months.<p>We're looking for mobile developers, web developers and design minded folks. We're looking for both full-time and interns. We actually take a lot of interns from UMBC as we're located a mile and half away from the campus.<p>If you're interested please get a hold of me at mforr@mindgrub dot com.<p>Thanks!","time":1320158650,"type":"comment"}
