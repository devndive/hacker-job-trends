Our next phase -- the stuff the new hires will be working on -- is to move beyond merely reporting what's happening into making sense of it, and making actionable predictions based on it. That means event detection and machine learning on big, messy, real-world data sets.<p>Because this is all new dev, we are language and technology agnostic. If you think you can solve these problems, we'll let you pick the best tools for the job. We're looking for curiosity, enthusiasm, and a track record -- you know, \"smart and gets things done\" :-)","time":1320170416,"type":"comment"}
