Lookout is the current leader in consumer mobile security, and we're aiming to keep it that way. We're a small, well-funded team tackling big problems on small devices.<p>Perks include: competitive salary, benefits, mobile phone of your choice, dream hardware setup of your choice, and a new office space in January when we move (We'll be on two floors at Market and 1st). There's also the standard start-up perks like a well-stocked fridge, craft beers on tap, and the fuzzy feeling that comes with shipping meaningful, net-positive products.<p>For engineering, experience in Rails, iOS, Android, and/or network/mobile security are awesome to have, but not required.<p>For data, it'd be cool if you had experience in SQL, R, Python, or Hadoop. If you're interested in machine learning and implementing it, then I'm interested in a conversation with you.<p>We're also looking for PMs and Lead UX Designers.\nRegardless of whatever job position you're interested in, send me an e-mail with questions, resumes, requests for beer, etc. to thomson.nguyen@mylookout.com.
