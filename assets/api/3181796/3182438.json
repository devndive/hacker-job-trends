We're looking for a few great software engineers to help take our product to the next level. If you're interested (or know someone who is), read more and give us your info at <a href=\"http://ringio.wufoo.com/forms/ringio-software-engineer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ringio.wufoo.com/forms/ringio-software-engineer/</a> or email nick AT ringio.com<p>Major areas of development focus:<p>* Modern HTML Applications - We’re very excited about the JavaScript frameworks that have grown in popularity the last few years (like Backbone.js, ExtJS, or SproutCore). We’re interested in using web technologies for our mobile and desktop applications, so if you’re experienced with (or just interested in) JavaScript, CoffeeScript, SCSS, WebSockets, or BOSH, there’s a lot of research and development to be done.<p>* Voice Technology - All calls using Ringio run through our voice systems to enable things like on-hold music, call screening, and transfers. We have a lot of new voice functionality that we’d like to build, as well as technology we’d like to integrate. This is fairly unique to our industry and involves some interesting timing, concurrency, and state management problems.<p>* API Development - Integration with CRM systems and reselling partners requires APIs for large pieces of our platform. We need help expanding our APIs, making sure they’re usable and secure, and testing that they’re working correctly.<p>We’re Looking For People Who Are:<p>* Smart software developers<p>* Familiar with object oriented programming. We use Grails and Java for our major systems. Grails, Groovy, or Java experience isn’t required, but you’ll be expected to get up to speed quickly.<p>* Familiar with Unix/Linux command-line systems. Logging into a Linux server to count the number of ERROR lines in a log file grouped by hour wouldn’t be difficult for you.<p>* Excited about joining a startup<p>* Authorized to work in the US<p>* Able to work from our McLean, VA office (flexibility to work from home sometimes, but most time will be at the office)<p>If you're interested, check out <a href=\"http://ringio.wufoo.com/forms/ringio-software-engineer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ringio.wufoo.com/forms/ringio-software-engineer/</a> or email nick AT ringio.com","time":1320160688,"type":"comment"}
