At spider.io, we look to distinguish legitimate human website visitors from nefarious automated traffic.<p>It’s a hard engineering problem. It would be a hard problem at toy levels of traffic. We need reverse Turing tests. We need to analyse from the application layer to below the TCP layer. We need clever stateful classifiers, that classify information based on previously received information. And if this isn’t hard enough, imagine doing this across four times the number of messages each day than the number of tweets received by Twitter each day. This is where we’ll be before the year is out. And for us this is just the beginning.<p>If you're an engineer and would like to help us make this happen, check out our careers page: <a href=\"http://spider.io/careers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://spider.io/careers/</a>","time":1320156364,"type":"comment"}
