I'll take smart over senior any day though. I'm basically looking for someone that isn't afraid to pick up a new language and dig when they need to. Our clients constantly challenge us, so it's an interesting job, for sure. Not a typical HN starup but you'll learn a lot.<p><a href=\"http://www.wearelollipop.com/2011/10/senior-interactive-developer-wanted/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.wearelollipop.com/2011/10/senior-interactive-deve...</a>","time":1320155595,"type":"comment"}
