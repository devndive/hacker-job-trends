Eurystheus ordered Hercules to kidnap the beast called Cerberus who guards the gates of hell - the brazed voiced hound of Hades and a monster not to be overcome and that may not be described, who eats raw flesh, fifty headed, relentless and strong. Near the gates of Acheron, a weaponless Hercules found the beast waiting for him. He resembled a retailer’s point of sale system.<p>You are a Hercules incarnate. Your weapons will include CoffeeScript, Ruby, JVM, Mac/Win/Lin[1], iOS, Android, maybe even a little C. Help us crush the mediocre POS industry incumbents. Multiple headed beasts, they are tired, decadent organizations and veritable deserts upon which the seeds of innovation and creativity find no purchase.<p>ShopKeep is fixing point of sale and becoming the “last mile” for local. A profoundly disruptive solution, we have established a beachhead in a sector in dire need of innovation. A well funded NYC based startup, we are fixing technology depressed, mind numbingly overpriced, and overly complex POS solutions and making them less expensive and highly customizable for both very large and very small customers.<p>Help us as we take this battle to the next level. You will lead the development of our products. Your releases will immediately be running[2] in thousands of actual brick-and-mortar stores.
