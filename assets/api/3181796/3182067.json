We use information extraction, machine learning, distributed computing and custom search algorithms to transform ridiculously huge volumes of data into useful information. And we're building a pretty cool user interface, too.<p>Our team is 12 people strong now, but we want to double that over the next year. So if you think you have something to contribute, then we definitely want to hear from you (jobs@hopper.com). Are you in the Boston area? We're opening a new office in Cambridge soon.","time":1320156522,"type":"comment"}
