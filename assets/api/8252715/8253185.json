I am a 9th grade homeschooler who has always done okay in math, but I had some major gaps and lacked mastery in a lot of concepts, especially with fractions. Ever since I have started Khan, I have been able to go back and not only fill in those gaps, but master them. And now, fractions are one of the concepts I do best!<p>This site is amazing and continues to get better every month. Thank you to Sal Khan, the Khan team, all its sponsors, and all its interns for making this site better and more available to all students from around the world. Please keep doing what you are doing!<p>==================================<p>Every month we get hundreds of letters like this from people in all walks of life who are thankful for our free, high-quality educational content. Most of you reading this are familiar with Sal&#x27;s videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site.<p>A few things we&#x27;re currently working on building right now:<p>– Tons of improvements to our core learning dashboard [1] and predictive knowledge models [2] so we can better personalize a learner&#x27;s experience<p>– Infrastructure improvements to make the site more reliable and faster for our millions of visitors every month [3]<p>– Better tools for our content creators to allow them to make thousands of engaging, interactive exercise problems without knowing how to code [4]<p>– A major revision to our iOS app to let students practice skills on the go (or in a classroom with iPads!)<p>- Expanding access for the billions of learners around the globe through various internationalization efforts<p>You&#x27;ll be part of a small team working alongside both &quot;celebrity&quot; devs (like jQuery creator John Resig, and Google&#x27;s first employee Craig Silverstein) and many more who you haven&#x27;t heard of but who are also really awesome.<p>We&#x27;re especially looking for new product designers (of all types) but we also have many engineering positions open as well as some positions for a teacher and contract question writers.<p>Apply at <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.khanacademy.org&#x2F;careers</a> and mention that you&#x27;re coming from HN.
