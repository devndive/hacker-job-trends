{"by":"shedd","id":8253775,"parent":8252715,"text":"Zoomer (YC S14) - REMOTE<p>Zoomer is building a new take on food delivery - a platform to handle an extraordinarily high volume of concurrent deliveries from restaurants that already deliver (i.e. pizza, wings, sandwiches, etc.).  We’re bringing much needed change to local high-volume delivery restaurants that are still doing delivery the way they’ve always done it.  It&#x27;s a very interesting technology and logistics problem, quickly routing orders to optimal drivers in near-real-time.  Our CEO has a substantial amount of experience in the space from his first startup.<p>In addition to Y Combinator, we are backed by some of the premier early stage venture capital funds, including First Round Capital and SV Angel, and awesome angel investors like Eric Ries &amp; Gabriel Weinberg, the founder of DuckDuckGo.  This is your opportunity to get in on the ground-floor. You would be engineer number 3 or 4.  You’ll have a ton of impact – lots of freedom to help us evolve our platform, stack, and apps.  We have strong dev practices, put an emphasis on testing, and deploy rapidly.<p>Our stack: We have an AI backend service that handles order routing, multiple mobile applications – for our drivers and restaurants, and several Ruby on Rails applications for customer-facing&#x2F;internal services.  We’re using Angular.js and CoffeeScript on the frontend.<p>The roles we’re hiring for:<p><pre><code>  * Artificial Intelligence engineer\n  * Data Science – roles open for data analysis and data infrastructure\n  * Ruby on Rails engineers\n  * Frontend engineer (Angular.js)\n  * Mobile (iOS and Android) engineers\n  * Infrastructure&#x2F;DevOps engineer\n </code></pre>\nIf this sounds interesting and you&#x27;d like to learn more, send me an email: robert@zoomer.io","time":1409590781,"type":"comment"}
