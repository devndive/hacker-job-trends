You get to hack network and&#x2F;or security protocols, innards of mobile operating systems and build a global distributed system around brand new protocols.<p>We&#x27;re currently looking for<p>- ANDROID PLATFORM LEVEL ENGINEER<p>You&#x27;d be responsible for our Android platform SDK (so you&#x27;d be writing some combination of Java and C++ code). In the process, you&#x27;d get to learn all about vagaries of mobile platforms and mobile networks at the global scale. In addition, you&#x27;ll have your pick of dozens of delicious, hard problems to solve in the realm of distributed systems, unix&#x27;y things, iOS stuff (to be compatible on both platforms), security etc.<p>I&#x27;m  Founder&#x2F;CEO&#x2F;CTO.
