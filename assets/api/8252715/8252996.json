We&#x27;re getting some exciting growth, traction, and users love our service.<p>We have a huge whiteboard full of exciting features we can&#x27;t wait to get started on, and we need your help to turn them into a reality, and to help continue to delight our existing and future users.<p>We&#x27;re mainly looking for Python&#x2F;Django experience to start, but if you&#x27;ve got a wide variety of skills, it always helps to be a generalist in a startup.<p>To apply, can you please send me some information about some business apps you&#x27;ve worked on in the past. Ideally anything relating to business processes&#x2F;quotes&#x2F;invoices&#x2F;accounting is great, but is not necessary, since we believe that a cultural fit is just as important as technical skill.<p>We&#x27;d offer a trial to start with, and then if we&#x27;re both happy with how we work together, we&#x27;d offer you a full-time position.<p>Please send me an email directly at jay@makeleaps.com - I&#x27;m one of the founders. Looking forward to chatting with you!<p>(We also organise the Hacker News community meetups in Tokyo, so if you&#x27;re planning on traveling to Japan and want to get a feel for the startup community here, see if there&#x27;s a meetup going on at hntokyo.doorkeeper.jp)","time":1409581857,"type":"comment"}
