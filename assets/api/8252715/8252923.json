We have been in business since 2004 and many thousands of teams, both small and large, use our products. We are hiring for different positions, but our main focus right now is on hiring a technical support engineer to help us support our TestRail customers as well as account engineers to help us demo&#x2F;sell our products.<p>Those are not typical support and sales roles though, as our products and customers are very technical (they are software dev&#x2F;testing teams), so both positions are quite challenging.<p>Job Openings<p>===================================<p>Technical Support Engineer:\n<a href=\"http://www.gurock.com/about/jobs/support-engineer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gurock.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;support-engineer&#x2F;</a><p>Account Engineer:\n<a href=\"http://www.gurock.com/about/jobs/account-engineer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gurock.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;account-engineer&#x2F;</a><p>Product Evangelist:\n<a href=\"http://www.gurock.com/about/jobs/product-evangelist/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gurock.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;product-evangelist&#x2F;</a><p>DevOps Engineer:\n<a href=\"http://www.gurock.com/about/jobs/devops-engineer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gurock.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;devops-engineer&#x2F;</a><p>Software Developer:\n<a href=\"http://www.gurock.com/about/jobs/software-developer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gurock.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;software-developer&#x2F;</a>","time":1409581021,"type":"comment"}
