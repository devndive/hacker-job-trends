The company is well-funded by some of the best enterprise angels and VCs in the business (<a href=\"https://angel.co/bettercompany\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;bettercompany</a>).<p>Our app facilitates anonymous sharing within companies. Getting feedback in the workplace is hard. Suggestion boxes suck, 360 reviews suck, questionnaires from HR suck. We can do better. Although we monetize with paying enterprise customers, our focus is on creating a product loved and trusted by individuals.<p>We&#x27;re looking for solid developers to work on all aspects of the app. Experience with node.js, Python, Objective-C, Java, client-side Javascript or Linux would be directly relevant, but we&#x27;re also interested in hackers with experience with &quot;mind-expanding&quot; technologies, like Lisp, Smalltalk, Erlang, Haskell etc.<p>We&#x27;re also looking for a security engineerâ€”someone who can audit the codebase, find and fix vulnerabilities and evaluate proposed features for their security impact.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, contact me at colin@bettercompany.co","time":1409687824,"type":"comment"}
