At FanJam, we&#x27;re building a new kind of fantasy basketball game on web and mobile. Were a small team with backgrounds in startups, consulting, and venture capital. Our team shares a love for either sports or haskell, but we all share a common love for building the best work place.<p>In this role, you&#x27;d be mostly working on our backend in Haskell, developing core components, features and infrastructure. We&#x27;re looking for people experienced in building large software projects in a functional programming paradigm. You write clean code using a modular approach. You care about things like good API design, know what REST is and how to use its principles (and when not to).<p>We invest in our people, and team build through whiskey, basketball games, and hack weeks. We keep the fridge stocked, stay as transparent as possible, and will buy whatever resources you need to keep learning (books, screencasts, etc) We&#x27;re still a small team, so this is a great opportunity to have a big impact on the product and our culture. We&#x27;re looking for people with a passion for their work with high standards. Ideal candidates have a demonstrated experience hacking stuff; code samples are best (GitHub, a personal website&#x2F;blog, previous projects are all great).<p>Skills were looking for<p>• Proven experience in Haskell or other functional programming languages.<p>• Familiarity with Javascript is a big plus, since that means you can handle our client-side too when necessary.<p>• Being able to get things done and to ship code.<p>• Experience with large code bases and structuring code in a modular way.<p>• Affinity with the web, browsers and new web technologies.<p>• Familiarity with basic development tools: you know your way around git, bash, grep and sed. You&#x27;re not afraid to write a shell script to automate some stuff.<p>• Have a good sense of humor and leave your ego at the door<p>• A desire to get better every day<p>Interested?
