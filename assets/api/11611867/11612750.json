Mesosphere&#x27;s data center OS makes it easy to run big data frameworks like Storm, Apache Spark, and Apache Hadoop. Applications designed for elasticity can leverage idle resources, improving resource utilization and reducing total costs.<p>Mesosphere&#x27;s systems &amp; networking team is currently looking for several talented and highly motivated software engineers to enable networking and service discovery for microservices and big data workloads.<p>Our team builds distributed control planes. These distributed control planes are the glue between the DCOS orchestration layer and off the shelf data planes, such as the Linux kernel.<p>We use whatever technology is required to achieve extremely high availability for our customers. Currently our tech stack is built in Erlang, C, and Go. We use underlying techniques such as gossip, CRDTs, probabilistic algorithms, and statistical analysis to build fault-tolerant distributed systems. We are trailblazers in the largely undefined territory of software defined infrastructure.<p>To Begin, email: Sargun@sargunme","time":1462205819,"type":"comment"}
