We are using Spark, Hadoop and Kafka along with Scala, Akka and Play. Risk Central will be used across the bank by front and middle offices along with risk managers. The build out of the system has just started and we are still in the process of putting our team together so this is a great time to come in to the project. We are focused right now on people with hands-on knowledge of Spark in a production setting who can help guide the architecture and development of all components involving Spark. As we are using Scala across our stack, familiarity with Scala and functional programming is heavily preferred. Familiarity with cats or scalaz is a big plus.<p>Please apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jpmchase.taleo.net&#x2F;careersection&#x2F;jobdetail.ftl?job=160027871&amp;lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jpmchase.taleo.net&#x2F;careersection&#x2F;jobdetail.ftl?job=1...</a>.","time":1462201990,"type":"comment"}
