Right now, we&#x27;re looking for iOS Developer #2 to join me, iOS Developer #1.<p>Technical Background: 100% Swift codebase, including 362 test cases (and growing!). The codebase is only 10 months old and has been built from the ground up on patterns like reactive design + MVVM. This week we&#x27;re launching the first internal beta build to the whole company! We&#x27;d like to open-source as much as possible, too, once we get a chance to breathe.<p>Company Background: We&#x27;re a gang of folks on an awesome mission: We raise money for good causes. At CrowdRise, you&#x27;ll regularly get emails in your inbox that the thing your working on has helped people get a surgery they needed or shelter they couldn&#x27;t afford. It&#x27;s quite a fulfilling job. As far as org structure goes, the LA office is all engineering so it&#x27;s a bit of a nerd oasis. We&#x27;re about 35 people in our Downtown LA office, near Bottega Louie and Seven Grand. (We&#x27;re across the street from One Wilshire, so we have a 1-2ms ping which is fun, too.)<p>Hiring Process: First, we&#x27;d like to talk on the phone and ask you some light technical questions and give you the chance to ask us questions. Next, we&#x27;ll ask you to come into the office and meet the team. For the iOS part of the interview, I&#x27;ve been keeping a Playground in the project repo with some interview questions. I&#x27;d like to pair with you in the Playground on those questions, and generally just talk iOS. There will be no reverse binary tree sorting.<p>If this sounds like your kinda place, please email me personally with your resume and, if you happen to have any, some work samples: (my-first-name-which-is-in-my-HN-handle)@crowdrise.com. I promise a reply to everyone who emails!","time":1462212816,"type":"comment"}
