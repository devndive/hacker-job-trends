We believe there should be seamless connection of any device, any measurable and any signal--unrestricted in volume, real-time and intelligent. The n.io platform empowers that vision. We also believe in self-deprecating humor, the power of caffeine, BBQ lunches, and comfortable pants.<p>Our Interviews: We start by getting to know candidates first, a quick video chat to open the lines of communication and get YOUR questions answered. Our second step is a technical discussion, where we can find out about your skills and you can ask us about our stack and various processes. Then it&#x27;s up the ladder for final steps.<p>You: If developing transformative software is your thing, this is the job for you. The n.io platform itself operates as a backend but our engineers work across the entire stack. Responsibilities will include writing code to support the integration of the n.io platform as well as systems that rely on it, diagnosing issues both internally and externally, and architecting complex systems for a unique portfolio of projects that work in true real-time. Current projects include industrial internet and precision agriculture.<p>For more information, or to apply, email Andrew Joynt at ajoynt (at)n(dot)io or just check out <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;n.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;n.io</a>!","time":1462211053,"type":"comment"}
