We have our solution live in several hospital systems, and help hospitals identify patients who&#x27;ll have bad outcomes. We help hospitals intervene early - and help patients avoid suffering. We recently closed a funding round, and are looking to expand aggressively.<p>We are looking for talented data engineers to join our team. We work with several data sources - from clinical data sources directly from hospitals, to public data sets, to socioeconomic datasets. Our data engineers help incorporate all this data into a single dataset that&#x27;s used for modeling, and for real-time scoring of patients.\nWe&#x27;re looking for someone who&#x27;s independent and curious, and has strong SQL skills. Knowledge of healthcare is a plus, but not necessary. We use Amazon Web Services for our entire stack, so prior experience with that would also be a plus.<p>Full job description at this link:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jvion.com&#x2F;careers-systemengineering.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jvion.com&#x2F;careers-systemengineering.html</a><p>If you have any questions, or are interested, feel free to e-mail me at binal.patel@jvion.com .","time":1462549463,"type":"comment"}
