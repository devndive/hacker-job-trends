Think of it like an app store for things which make websites better. For developers, we are the Heroku for code which gets deployed onto websites.\nIf you like writing JS&#x2F;CSS and the idea of building reusable open source components is interesting to you... If you like writing Go and would like to work on the twenty or so microservices which power our infrastructure... If you are interested in working on Marketing&#x2F;Growth&#x2F;BizDev in a growing startup which is aiming to change the way thousands of SaaS companies reach their customers...\nPlease reach out, I&#x27;d love a chance to chat with you about what we&#x27;re doing and what you&#x27;re looking for -&gt; zack@eager.io","time":1462203443,"type":"comment"}
