And why. Fanatical lawyers leave Law School every year seeking to advise and protect their clients. They then spend their careers filing paperwork and manually running their business instead of focusing on the one thing they want to do: Practicing Law.<p>Allowing small law firms to practice law: This is our passion and why we do what we do.<p>Our .Net backend is the foundation of our product, originally conceived as WPF desktop software, we’re using this springboard to launch our javascript SAAS with Node ES6 and Angular.js.<p>Direction: Our CEO is a developer, and largely to blame for any historical legacy issues. He’s actually pretty good (and approved this message).<p>Technical debt: There’s some, but it’s all easily dealt with. We’re Git based and are working on our CI framework Go.cd.<p>Test: Full TDD, we have one Test consultant, she helps you TDD better.<p>Microservices: Yes. Docker containers etc too.<p>Backend: Node ES6<p>Front End: Angular.JS + TCL (just joking… but you’re welcome to make an impassioned defence of the betamax of the software world).<p>Gender mix: Honestly, we’re fairly male dominated, we’d love to change this and actively invite applications from all genders.<p>Hours: Totally flexible<p>Dresscode: Clothing required. Singlets are a bit of a no-no, but that’s it.<p>For more information, check out: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smokeball.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;28632D575D\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smokeball.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;28632D575D</a> or contact james (dot) richardson (at) smokeball (dot) com","time":1462318051,"type":"comment"}
