This is a uniquely creative space in Forecasting that requires our models to capture both the nuances of the global consumer marketplace as well as customer behavior on Amazon. Our team works closely with top research scientists to invent new ways to make use of novel data, solves hard engineering problems in machine learning around scaling and performance in predicting for tens of millions of products, and is endlessly focused on iterating quickly and failing fast to stay on the cutting edge.<p>In a field that&#x27;s in constant renaissance, we&#x27;re looking for a senior software development engineer who loves data, thinks analytically, and is prepared to design architecture that will provide a stable base for the next 3-5 years of evolution. If you have 5+ years of experience in software development, with experience in ML or big data applications, and want to learn more about a team just getting started in mining the vast datasets of Amazon -- I&#x27;d love to chat or buy you coffee. Email smai@ (amazon.com) with your resume and a brief introduction.<p>(Interview process is 1 phone screen and onsite interview with whiteboard coding and behavioral questions about your experience.)","time":1462206542,"type":"comment"}
