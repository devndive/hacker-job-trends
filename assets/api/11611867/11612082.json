This is an exciting opportunity for a proven leader with strong technical chops to evolve into a CTO role.<p>We&#x27;re using python(django-rest-framework) and js(react). DB wise we&#x27;re postgres and we use ansible to provision the servers. We&#x27;re currently 2 devs: one with the team in Amsterdam plus one dev working remote. We&#x27;re running on Azure as BizSpark members but there is a strong preference to diversify on AWS in the near future.","time":1462202398,"type":"comment"}
