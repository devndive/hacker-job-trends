Shot over several years in Russia and the Ukraine, DAU is now post-producing in London. The setting is 1938-1968 in the Soviet Union. We have 700 hours of material (all shot on 35mm) out of which we are making feature films, TV series and a slate of science and arts documentaries, as well as a multi-media project.<p>For the media project, we have been working on a web application to let viewers explore the raw, unedited footage (using time-based annotations compiled by a team of analysts) and interact in real-time with other viewers. The footage and annotations are stored using a slightly-customised instance of an open-source video archive platform, built with Django, PostgreSQL and friends.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a frontend (or front-leaning full-stack) developer to focus on, well, the frontend: iterating on the current design, informed by user feedback, towards an immersive and intuitive navigation system. You&#x27;ll need strong web frontend development skills (HTML, CSS, ES6). Some UX design experience would be very helpful.  One or more of the following would be great, but not at all essential:<p>* Experience with Django and PostgreSQL (for the archive platform)<p>* Experience with search, multimedia, real-time communications, or recommendation systems<p>* Experience with data analysis in Python using pandas, scipy, and friends<p>* Some Linux sysadmin skills<p>* Strong opinions about any of the above<p>This could be a full-time or part-time position, depending on your situation and availability. Most, if not all, of the work will need to be carred out on-site.<p>Contact recruitment@phenomenfilms.com to apply for this position.","time":1462374539,"type":"comment"}
