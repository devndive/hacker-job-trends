Contact jobs@density.io and include the information you think is relevant.<p>At Density, we build a small sensor that measures how busy a location is in realtime. Customers mount the unit above a doorway, connect it to power and WiFi, and use our API to access how many people have visited.\nWhen we announced what we were doing last summer, we hoped technical companies and developers would reach out. They did. But so too did hundreds of others from all around the world and in completely different markets. Some with expansive, two thousand location networks, others asking for a few hundred, and many with just one set of doors they deeply cared about: airlines, SMBs, Fortune 500s, startups, ad agencies, country transit systems, etc.<p>We’ve since learned that “human load balancing” is a widespread and unsolved problem. Today, we believe our platform may democratize access to a fundamental piece of information that has simply been uncollected and lost.","time":1462218996,"type":"comment"}
