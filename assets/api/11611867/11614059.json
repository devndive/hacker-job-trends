Specializing in route planning &amp; ride recording (with an established website and popular app), we work closely with individual riders, clubs, events, tour companies, and more.<p>We&#x27;re ready to expand our team as we find the right people specializing in any of the following:<p>- Design: We need someone on board who can make everything we have (and are building) look great, and can lead on difficult UX problems.<p>- Frontend: Lots of cool stuff on our website, with lots more in the pipeline. We&#x27;re in the process of moving all new dev to React&#x2F;Redux.<p>- Mobile: iOS or Android devs interested, please inquire. We&#x27;ve got awesome users that regularly spend hours relying on our app, and it does a lot.<p>- Backend&#x2F;devops: We rack our own hardware, host an OSM stack, MySQL, Redis, Rails, and more, and would love someone on the team that can split their time between backend dev and devops with a focus on either.<p>We work reasonable hours, have great benefits, love solving problems for our customers, go on bike rides and encourage each other to live healthy happy lives. It&#x27;s a really nice working environment with a cool product and customer.<p>Please inquire for more info: zack@ridewithgps.com","time":1462213581,"type":"comment"}
