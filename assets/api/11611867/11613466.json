And the testimonials we receive every day remind us that our impact isn&#x27;t just about big numbers — access to free education meaningfully changes the lives of people in all sorts of situations. (In a recent survey, 64% of first generation students at selective colleges said that “Khan Academy has had a meaningful impact on their education”.)<p>We face intense challenges in providing access to students across the world (think: everything from videos to interactive content, in and out of classrooms, in all the most important languages, on all the most important devices). We use our data to personalize students&#x27; learning and continually improve our content. We&#x27;re trying to build a strong, diverse team — and we need more help.<p>We&#x27;ve made some great hires off HN and would love to make more.
