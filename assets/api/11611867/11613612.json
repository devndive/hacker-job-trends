Want to help keep it running? At EnergyHub, we work with utilities and consumers to turn smart thermostats (and other devices) into virtual power plants, dialing back demand at times of system stress. We save users money, we save utilities headaches, and we save EVERYONE the emission of harmful greenhouse gases. And we do it with - you guessed it - software.<p>We&#x27;re a small team, so you will be exposed to much of the stack - from Java services speaking to devices, to html&#x2F;ios&#x2F;android frontends; from Python analytical code (thermal modeling, etc), to operations in Ansible. (&quot;Hey: Ansible is written in Python, so that second phrase isn&#x27;t really a contrast!&quot; - great point. It sounds like you know something about the tools we use, and are a critical thinker! Please consider applying!)<p>See our Full-Stack Engineer posting @ <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.jobvite.com&#x2F;m?3KiMViww\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.jobvite.com&#x2F;m?3KiMViww</a><p>-<p>William Cybriwsky<p>Engineer, EnergyHub","time":1462210742,"type":"comment"}
