Currently, our team works on cutting edge communications SDKs such as Programmable Video (WebRTC video) and Programmable Voice (WebRTC Audio).<p>We&#x27;re looking to add another member to the team with a deep core understanding of JavaScript, and a good knowledge of standards. Our primary job responsibility is to create intuitive, simple APIs over fairly complex mechanisms, so experience with designing public APIs is crucial. Any experience with WebRTC is a big plus, but not necessary.<p>Feel free to send a resume if you have one, however I&#x27;d be more interested in seeing code samples (A link to your github, stackoverflow, etc should suffice). Please send your linkedin profile over too, if you have one.<p>Please DM me here if interested, with your email address and the information above. Looking forward to hearing from you!","time":1462209192,"type":"comment"}
