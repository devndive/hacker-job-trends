We’re on a mission to make world-class healthcare convenient and accessible to all of humanity.\nWith Akira, Canadians can consult with physicians on-demand by secure text or video. They have mobile access to their health records, including labs, imaging, doctor’s notes, and prescriptions. And they have a Personal Health Assistant who will focus on preventing illness, rather than simply treating it.\nBased in Toronto, we’re building an interdisciplinary team of physicians, developers, data scientists and designers to tackle hard problems in healthcare technology. Our mobile health platform - currently in beta across Canada - will bring much-needed change to a medical system still reliant on fax machines and paper charts.\nOur long-term goal is to double the average global human lifespan by automating the delivery of medical advice and treatment.\nIf you&#x27;re passionate about moving healthcare forward, email me at alex@akira.md or apply at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;akira.md&#x2F;about.html#careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;akira.md&#x2F;about.html#careers</a>","time":1462213825,"type":"comment"}
