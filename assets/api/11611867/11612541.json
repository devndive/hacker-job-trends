We are hiring engineers and designers at our offices in Grand Rapids or Columbus. A little bit about us:<p><pre><code>  - We aren&#x27;t limited to any really specific set of    \n    technologies, which is a great opportunity to learn. In \n    the past two years, we&#x27;ve worked with Python, Angular + \n    CoffeeScript, Node.js, Ember.js, Swift, and Ruby&#x2F;Rails.\n\n  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we \n    each have lives, activities, and families outside of \n    work. Late nights and &gt; 40 hour weeks are rare by \n    design.\n\n  - We offer competitive salaries, top notch benefits, \n    quarterly profit sharing, and more.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about you:\n  - You love making software, and you have a couple of years \n    of experience building software with a variety of tools \n    and technologies.<p><pre><code>  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of \n    technologies, but you’re not afraid to use more. You \n    have some experience with web or mobile tech.\n\n  - You believe software is written for humans, not \n    computers.\n\n  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the \n    people you work with.\n</code></pre>\nIf you&#x27;re interested, check out our website: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mutuallyhuman.com&#x2F;hiring&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mutuallyhuman.com&#x2F;hiring&#x2F;</a> Also, feel free to get in touch with me: mike@mutuallyhuman.com","time":1462204762,"type":"comment"}
