But we&#x27;re just scratching the surface- we believe we have an opportunity to fundamentally change the way that software is built- by creating a network of developers that share knowledge about how they&#x27;re building software. Whether you&#x27;re building a new mobile app, automating infrastructure, or just researching best practices, StackShare will be your compass.<p>We&#x27;re looking for engineers and evangelists that are already part of the StackShare community, are excited about our vision and want to be a part of shaping it!
