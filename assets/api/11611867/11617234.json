Our mission is to help make ads better by allowing websites to remove the distracting and annoying ads and replace them with ones that are more native - similar to how Facebook and Twitter have ads that fit in with their user experience.\n&#x27;\nA lot of people bash adtech but if you&#x27;re interested in diving deep into high performance tech and get experience across a wide range of technologies there are few other industries that can compare. Would love to chat with anyone - even if you&#x27;re not that interested in the roles - dgoldin@triplelift.com","time":1462239902,"type":"comment"}
