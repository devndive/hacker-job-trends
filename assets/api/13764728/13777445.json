Members of the group have published at top conferences such as OSDI, NSDI, FAST, MobiSys, Middleware, etc. We are currently hiring hands-on systems researchers as well as people with strong software development skills in Python, Java, C, or C++. If you are very comfy with coding for Android or Linux, do mention that. Also, if you have coded against a DB like MySQL, Riak, Cassandra, or a pub&#x2F;sub system, bonus points! The right candidate must be comfy with concurrency primitives (have used locks, critical sections in practice and understand the implications thereof) and network programming. We don&#x27;t carry pagers or have on-call - the work is more about coming up with compelling ideas and creating proof of concept demos&#x2F;prototypes to illustrate them. This is a very unique opportunity for a serious developer who is interested in getting exposure to a research lab setting. The company offers lots of perks. Please mention you saw the post on HN.<p>P.S. My first &quot;Who Is Hiring&quot; post. Please be gentle :)","time":1488483429,"type":"comment"}
