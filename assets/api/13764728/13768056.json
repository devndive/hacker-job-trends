Hiring doctors and other clinicians is an opaque, outmoded industry rife with expensive brokers and mounds of paperwork. Nomad is fixing that by building a platform that connects clinicians directly to the facilities that hire them. Doctors regain control of their job search, hospitals regain control of their costs.<p>We&#x27;re a small (N=4) engineering team and we&#x27;re looking for a Product Engineer to help build and expand our platform. Our stack is Python&#x2F;Flask with React&#x2F;Redux on the client.<p>Inquiries and interest: careers@nomadhealth.com","time":1488400787,"type":"comment"}
