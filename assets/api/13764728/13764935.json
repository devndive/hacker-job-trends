Our platform is used by some of the largest companies in the world (HP, Visa, Qualcomm, etc.) to aggregate learning content from both public providers (e.g. Udacity, Pluralsight) and private catalogs (internal learning systems), empower their employees to share what they&#x27;re learning (e.g. articles from HN), and track employee progress towards career goals. We&#x27;ve got real revenue, real customers, and a real opportunity to make learning better for employees everywhere.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a Backend Engineer to join the engineering team. We&#x27;ve built out a GraphQL API that our frontend team consumes, which means our backend engineers get to focus on much more interesting problems than fetching data for views. We leverage our PostgreSQL schema <i>heavily</i> to enforce our business logic via DB constraints, trigger functions, and all kinds of fun things... When you aren&#x27;t designing database models, you&#x27;ll be writing integrations with a variety of external services, working on our machine learning models, and - of course - LEARNING.<p>If you share our particular love for Postgres, Ruby, GraphQL, data, and learning, contact me (neville@pathgather.com, CTO) or apply to our careers link below!<p>BACKEND ENGINEER (Ruby&#x2F;Postgres&#x2F;GraphQL), $100-130k, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;pathgather&#x2F;e700098b-b552-4b10-a5a5-e0e1e49a4154\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;pathgather&#x2F;e700098b-b552-4b10-a5a5-e0e...</a>","time":1488385037,"type":"comment"}
