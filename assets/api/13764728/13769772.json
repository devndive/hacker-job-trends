This is on the forefront of the digital therapeutics space with a clinically grounded program that&#x27;s already showing strong results.<p>Our product team supports the human relationship between program participants and their dedicated health coach.  Projects include:<p>* a multi-platform smartphone app designed to drive behavior change through education, rich communication, and habit trigger push notifications;<p>* backend data integration and analysis of activity tracker and weight scale data for outcome focused decision making; and<p>* rapid iteration towards human-computer hybrid communication with both the low hanging fruit of supportive information design and also application of machine learning for real-time chat response.<p>We&#x27;re a small dev team using a Javascript everywhere stack (Express.js on Node.js for RESTful backend, Angular2 web app, Ionic2 mobile app) for maximum efficiency and collaboration.  The next hires will be a major part of defining our technical culture.<p>It&#x27;s my experience that strong developers can pick up almost any language and libraries with some time and support.  I&#x27;d love to hear from anyone with grounding in web technologies, object-oriented domain modeling, and functional programming who has an interest in fostering effective team communication.<p>Email Evan.Willms at BlueMesaHealth com","time":1488411357,"type":"comment"}
