We’re two engineers that have worked together for before and founded the company last year. Working to make data (big and small) easier for companies of all sizes. We’re deeply disappointed with the ETL tools in the market and are taking a new approach. Our product focuses on usability, reliability, and security. We integrate with the most common data sources (data bases&#x2F;warehouses, Hadoop, cloud services) across the three major clouds: AWS, GCP, and Azure. Our product has a hosted model and a self-hosted&#x2F;on-prem (quick deployment) model to meet the needs of any customer.<p>Our stack is centered around containerizing everything (using Kubernetes). This allows us to use the right programming language for the right task. We use Java, Scala, Python and Go. Our web app is Rails and React.<p>We have been working on the product for nearly a year but will give up to 33% of the founding equity for the right hire. We are looking for someone who is pragmatic, efficient, relentlessly resourceful, and focused.<p>Necessary experience: data warehousing, data pipelines (streaming and batch), cloud computing, containers, mastery of at least one of these: Java&#x2F;Scala&#x2F;Python&#x2F;C++.<p>Email us at stealthdatanyc@gmail.com. Tell us what you think we need to know about you.","time":1488384748,"type":"comment"}
