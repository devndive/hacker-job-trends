Your role would be in identifying suitable suppliers (competitive pricing &amp; automatable), building and developing business relationships and handling customer issues. This usually takes 15-60 minutes&#x2F;day and a regular routine is a must. We can start with 1-2 suppliers I know already.<p>Company must be incorporated in Delaware or Nevada, preferably as LLC. Initial required capital share $1-2k, up to 50% company share for you (ownership &amp; profit share), depending on your initial capital share. Company gets a license to my own software, state of art data transformation and repricing used in other companies. The idea is to have a passive income stream with minimum work&#x2F;attention needed. I already bootstrapped a few profitable companies this way and have time for creating 1-2 additional ones. I expect company to be profitable within 3-4 months with regular monthly expenses &lt;$50.<p>I am based in Germany and look for a US-resident to run a company with me during US working hours. I&#x27;ll do the whole tech side, you&#x27;d do complete business side. Some of my partners got substantial promotions in their main jobs for skills they learned running a real business with me.<p>I am looking at automating most of customer or even supplier interaction in the future.<p>The business is as described; it&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;d get an access to my time as a &quot;rock-star programmer&quot; as I have plenty of other interesting projects to work on.<p>If you are interested, contact me on weisen (at) tutamail.com","time":1488410262,"type":"comment"}
