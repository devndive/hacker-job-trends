(current S3 troubles notwithstanding) Think you can do better? Want to get in on the ground floor of that effort?<p>If you can get over the fact that we’re not a very popular topic at dinner parties then we can make it worth your while and challenge your ability to channel and organize data streams for ourselves and our partners.<p>Comcast is -very- motivated when it comes to putting together tools and environments that leverage the literal crap-ton of data (yes, thats an official SI unit) that arrives on our doorstep every second. We’re not stuck on must-have tools, languages, or mindsets since we know that the most effective ones will eventually show themselves regardless.  The same applies to the likes of yourself. We’re less interested in languages you code in, if you’re competent then you’ll be adaptable regardless.<p>Now, that said, our current toolsets include:  Spark, Terraform, Ansible, Genie, Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, Java, Scala, and a few others.<p>Tell us what drives you, what you’re passionate about.<p>Ping me at:  br24 at comcast dot net    I can tell you anything you need to know.","time":1488391458,"type":"comment"}
