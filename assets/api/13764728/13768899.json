We&#x27;re continually working on our matching algorithm (machine learning &amp; data science) and currently working on some big initiatives to improve how home buyers and sellers and agents interact with homelight and with each other (mobile apps, new product features, etc.)<p>We&#x27;re a small team of 7 engineers. Our stack is Ruby on Rails(4.2), and Postgresql hosted on Heroku. The front end is using Ember. We&#x27;ve got reasonable test coverage with rspec.<p>Tasks are reasonably defined, and its normal to push back on tasks to determine the business value in our work. We&#x27;re not just a feature factory, we care about the value delivered in what we build. As engineers, we have an enormous amount of latitude in the implementation details of our work.<p>Because we&#x27;re small, you&#x27;re going to need to know the full stack. You&#x27;re going to have to write javascript here, sorry.<p>I applied via the link on the careers page, but if you have any questions, you can email me at evan@homelight.com. When you apply, make sure to mention you saw this hackernews post.","time":1488405689,"type":"comment"}
