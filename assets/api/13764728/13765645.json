We are expanding our 13 person team and adding a Software Engineer and a Frontend Engineer. We have quite a bit of autonomy throughout our day, lots of input into the direction of the products we build, and get to innovate daily. Great pay, good perks, private offices, great hardware... basically you get to be treated like an adult. It&#x27;s honestly the best job I&#x27;ve had in years.<p>Our stack is ASP.net MVC, C#, AngularJS, Elastic, Redis, and SQL Server. Honestly we don&#x27;t care what technology stack you are familiar with, we just expect you to have mastered your own and be willing to learn.<p>Here is the software engineer position: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talent.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;employer&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;190895&#x2F;listing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talent.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;employer&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;190895&#x2F;listin...</a><p>Our interview process is pretty simple: \n1. An engineer reviews your resume. \n2. An engineer gives you a call to chat. \n3. A couple of engineers talk with you face to face. No bubble sort whiteboard coding bull, just a conversation. \n4. A take-home 4-8 hour real-world coding problem. Build something that does these things. Itâ€™s not a stupid brain teaser or something requiring special knowledge.<p>Send an email to careers@acculynx.com with a resume attached to apply.
