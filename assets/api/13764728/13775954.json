The folks doing the interviewing are much more interested in your ability to learn. This year&#x27;s tech won&#x27;t be current forever, and we&#x27;re already working on 2019&#x27;s anyway. That being said, if you&#x27;re already familiar with a few non-Ethernet networks, that&#x27;ll be conceptually helpful.<p>Interview is a first-round phone screen, then come in and meet some people, whiteboard some problems, pretty standard stuff. Brush up on your foosball, it&#x27;s that kind of place.","time":1488475259,"type":"comment"}
