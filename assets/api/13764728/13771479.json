We&#x27;re exploring the idea of remote workers but are still figuring out how that would work but my initial gut is that we would want someone to be fairly experienced for us to go ahead with it.<p>A bit about the company: TripleLift is an adtech company specializing in native advertising. We&#x27;re trying to get publishers to move away from the idea of commoditized banner ads so that they can focus on content first and monetization later. We do this by giving them the ability to drop a JS tag wherever they&#x27;d like an ad (typically in the main feed) and then rendering an ad that matches the look and feel of their site. There are quite a few technical challenges getting this to work at scale and I&#x27;d love to share more so please reach out - dgoldin@triplelift.com","time":1488429749,"type":"comment"}
