So we work with educational institutions to help them launch, run, and market their schools — and make sure they’re compliant with government regulations along the way.<p>One of the things we offer is customized software solutions that make it easy for institutions to track and teach students, and for regulatory agencies to track institutions. Right now, we’re looking for a full time DevOps Engineer with Ruby Experience to help build our next generation e-learning platform.<p>Join our team from wherever you are. Everyone here works remotely, although we meet and collaborate online all the time. We also meet up in person occasionally throughout the year. You’ll be able to find the perfect balance of working independently and being part of a supportive team that’s got your back.<p>This is the experience you should have: Using automated build configuration tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet. Architecting scalable web application infrastructures on AWS\nUnderstanding Ruby programming. If you have experience with Ruby on Rails and Sinatra, that will be pretty good, too.<p>This is what will take you over the top:\nExperience with other virtualization technologies like Xen, VirtualBox, VMWare, containers&#x2F;Docker, etc.","time":1441127724,"type":"comment"}
