We&#x27;re Nylas and we&#x27;re looking for help building the next generation email platform. We&#x27;re building a missing piece of Internet infrastructure and are looking for frontend application engineers, designers, backend systems engineers and infrastructure&#x2F;operations engineers to join us.<p>Companies are building their core businesses around our email API right now. We have to be reliable, up all the time, and fast. We have more data for a single user than in most startups&#x27; entire database. We&#x27;re scaling heavily and if you have experience with automated deployments, debugging running systems, release engineering, and on-call schedules, but are still comfortable writing code, this job might be for you. :)<p>Many people spend their entire days buried in mail clients which haven&#x27;t significantly changed in years.
