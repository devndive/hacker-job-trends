Currently I cannot disclose details about the project, but I can add that we have a great sales power compared to out potential competition and already secured interest from top companies in our country.<p>Nevertheless to the point: system is being created in Ember framework and our full-time front-end developer has sometimes insufficient experience with this framework. We are looking for some mentor with practical experience with Ember.js.<p>We can start with some remote co-operation, eventually mix it with some on-site time. If you will be interested - we will be also interested to turn this into long-term relation with an option to join us full time as a lead front-end developer and get some stock options (beside the salary).<p>Drop me a message at adam@invemax.com","time":1441122294,"type":"comment"}
