If you are adaptable, keen to learn about web development and interested in renewable energy, we want to talk to you.<p>At present, we build and maintain a Java Web Application to administrate our installer partners and provide info to end customers, built in Spring MVC, hosted on Rackspace cloud servers, using a MySQL database and utilising HTML, CSS and JS (in particular, jQuery) in the front-end. We&#x27;re an agile shop and we&#x27;re also starting a new project where we are planning to use PHP and Drupal, hosted on Ubuntu servers hosted at AWS so there&#x27;s plenty to get involved with.<p>As part of our small software development team, we want you to help us talk to our customers, build wireframes and demos and then create, test and deploy new applications that will be used by the rest of the company, by our clients and by the public. This is a great opportunity for you to develop high performance, modern web applications for a commercially successful, socially responsible and ethical business.","time":1441201415,"type":"comment"}
