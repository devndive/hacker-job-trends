I made Witness at the TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2015 Hackathon and it ended up winning the grand prize [1]. I launched Witness just 7 weeks ago right here on Show HN [2][3] and it’s been growing like crazy since. It became clear that this is more than just a side project, so I got funding and now I’m looking for one of you to join me as Engineer #2. You should have deep experience in at least one of { iOS | Android | video&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;codecs | hardware&#x2F;Bluetooth | web&#x2F;frontend | backend&#x2F;services | networks&#x2F;TCP } and a passion for writing simple, clean, performant, tested code fast.<p>Reach out to me at marinos@getwitness.com.
