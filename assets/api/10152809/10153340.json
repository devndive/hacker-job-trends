We&#x27;re passionate about making our customers happy and know that our tech plays a big part of that process. Come join us!<p>Most of the work requires backend knowledge:<p>* JavaScript (NodeJS) application development<p>* Postgres, Redis<p>* API development<p>* nginx&#x2F;AWS&#x2F;DevOps (some base knowledge, at the very least)<p>This is not a front-end position.
