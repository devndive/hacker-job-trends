We are hiring specifically in those 3 locations.<p>We love these people:<p><pre><code>  1. Go developers; crypto experience a big plus\n  2. iOS &#x2F; Android developers\n  3. Node &#x2F; Electron &#x2F; React &#x2F; JS &#x2F; front-end devs. We&#x27;ve just   begun building our cross-platform desktop app, and our website will change a *lot* in the coming months.\n  4. WINDOWS SPECIALISTS (for real)\n  5. Devops\n</code></pre>\nWe recently closed our Series A from Andreessen Horowitz, and our aim is to bring usable public key crypto to the masses. In a nutshell: open source, high quality crypto apps. Apps so easy you don&#x27;t need to know what a &quot;key&quot; is to use them...but with all the security of real end-to-end crypto.<p>We like to work with product-oriented engineers: people who realize the final product is the vision; the users are who matter.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, check out our job page: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keybase.io&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keybase.io&#x2F;jobs</a>","time":1441131212,"type":"comment"}
