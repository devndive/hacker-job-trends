Think programming contests&#x2F;olympiads but much easier (or FizzBuzz but slightly harder). Some of our programming problems are also freely available for training (see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codility.com&#x2F;programmers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codility.com&#x2F;programmers</a>).<p>We&#x27;re a small company (about 10 programmers and 30 employees in total) with many ideas how to expand our product. For me, the most interesting part is that at our scale, any contribution you make is very visible, and that there are plenty of opportunities to try out something new. I have been working with Codility for 2.5 years now and it has been real fun to see the team grow, improve our skills and learn new things.<p>As for the technical details: we are built around Python, Django and Postgres (along with some low-level C, as well as Ruby in the infrastructure code). We practice code reviews, pair programming and continuous delivery.<p>We are currently looking for full-stack software engineers; as well as people with strong frontend experience.
