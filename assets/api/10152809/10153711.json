You’ll also need to be comfortable working on the frontend with Javascript, CSS, and HTML - you don’t need to be a designer, but can get the job done. Repository patterns, dependency injection, and test frameworks are concepts that you’re comfortable working with.<p>We’re a small team with lots to do, so you’ll need to have good time management&#x2F;tracking skills, and the ability to get things done without lots of oversight. We strive to maintain a sustainable and balanced pace, and while some office hours may be needed, the remainder can be worked when and where you choose.<p>We are located just minutes from Lonsdale Quay on the North Shore, with a beautiful sunny patio for BBQing and several great restaurants nearby.<p>Contact me at robert@mineralservices.com if you are interested!","time":1441125783,"type":"comment"}
