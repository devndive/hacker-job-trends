We&#x27;ve been at this since 2010 and our referral network has gotten to a point where we need to make the jump and bring on some more help. We are currently two engineers and are looking to bring on #3.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lionheartsw.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lionheartsw.com&#x2F;</a> (yes, yes, the cobbler&#x27;s son has no shoes)<p>We&#x27;re fast and nimble, get to choose what projects we work on, what tech we work with, don&#x27;t have to deal with much technical debt, and build awesome products from the ground up. Our role is to help get the companies we work with get to MVP as soon as possible.<p>Once we ship, we help our clients interview or onboard a CTO or lead engineer or stick around for as-needed help. In many cases, though, we&#x27;ve just been retained indefinitely (I like to think it&#x27;s because our clients like us so much!). In some special cases, we take equity. We are currently booked through mid-October.<p>Key Skills (not requirements by any means, but preferable since these will help you hit the ground running)<p>* iOS Development<p>* Python&#x2F;Django<p>This is not a junior role. You should be capable &#x2F; have experience with critiquing everything from napkin sketches to fully-fledged visual designs and then shipping. We have a very design-focused product development process, so ideally you have an eye for design in addition to being a kickass developer.<p>What you get (not going to be coy about numbers. we need help now):<p>* Salary: $80k guaranteed, up to $120k + Bonus DOE<p>* Equity: 1-5% (depends on role, experience, and contribution)<p>Austin-based candidates highly preferred.<p>If any of this sounds intriguing, just send me an email (see profile).<p>Dan","time":1441149266,"type":"comment"}
