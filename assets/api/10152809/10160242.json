Most of us work at all levels of the web stack, but if your strengths lie in just frontend or backend work, that&#x27;s okay too.<p>We&#x27;re a small team (15 people) using PHP, Zend Framework, MySQL, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, RabbitMQ, and memcached. We have a customer-facing site, a JSON API, logistics software, and an internal admin site, all of which we build and maintain internally.<p>Hitmeister.de is one of the largest online shopping portals in Germany, with over 2.1 million customers to date. We have a warehouse from which we sell items directly, but we also have a marketplace with over 2,400 sellers running their own shops. We&#x27;re seeing solid growth and we&#x27;re looking for more programming talent to grow and improve the site.<p>Speaking German is helpful, but by no means required. I&#x27;m from the US and we have 3 other non-German developers. If you aren&#x27;t an EU citizen, we are glad to help with visa issues as long as you qualify for an EU Blue Card. If you have a CS degree or at least 5 years of full-time experience, then you probably qualify. We only allow on-site work, but we&#x27;ll help you relocate.<p>Here&#x27;s the job description in German:<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;company.hitmeister.de&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;webentwickler-frontend-backend&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;company.hitmeister.de&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;webentwickler-frontend-bac...</a><p>If you have any questions, feel free to get in contact with me (info in my profile), or you can apply directly at jobs@hitmeister.de.","time":1441210541,"type":"comment"}
