Application and UI Engineers to work with the contextual data we generate - exposing it to customers and building our reporting and internal management tools. Our systems handle billions of requests per day, with strong SLAs on reporting, uptime, and response time.<p>Both teams work primarily in Python. On the front-end we use D3 for charting, and the framework is Backbone, but anyone with experience in any JS framework should apply.<p>I&#x27;m an engineer, not a recruiter.
