You&#x27;re a productive member of your team, but you&#x27;re not yet ready to lead teams. Maybe you want to lead some day, but need the support to get there; or maybe it&#x27;s just not your thing. You should...<p>Have experience with JavaScript and Ruby.\nHave strong communication and collaboration skills.\nEnjoy pair programming (we may not pair all the time, but everyone pairs).\nBe curious about other languages and platforms (Go, Swift, iOS, ...).\nEnjoy being given goals and finding ways to achieve them.\nValue Agile XP Practices (Iterative development, Refactoring, TDD&#x2F;BDD, CI&#x2F;CD, ...).\nPrior consulting or freelancing experience is a bonus.\nWe&#x27;re currently using Ruby (mostly Rails) and JavaScript (Node.js) on the back-end. On the front-end we&#x27;re building sophisticated clients with HTML5&#x2F;JavaScript and Native iOS (Obj-C, Swift). That&#x27;s where we are today, but there&#x27;s no telling how that might evolve over the next few years. Weâ€™re always trying new things to see what works for us and our clients.<p>Our developers get a tremendous amount of experience because of how we work with one another and with our clients. Carbon Five is a great place to learn a ton and have a great time doing it.","time":1441127730,"type":"comment"}
