We have great backers, strong traction, and an 11-digit target market.<p>At one level, we&#x27;re a server operations tool: log analysis, system metrics, dashboards and alerting. Underneath, we&#x27;re building a super-high-speed distributed columnar database that enables interactive (subsecond) exploration of terabyte datasets; fronted by a lean, mean web UI.<p>Users love our product, because it&#x27;s fast, powerful, and straightforward. We love building our product, because we get to tackle fun challenges and we have customers who appreciate it. I&#x27;ve built half a dozen startups, including Writely (aka Google Docs), and I can honestly say this is my favorite so far.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in working on large-scale data filtering and aggregation, distributed systems, and extreme performance - drop me a line at steve@scalyr.com!
