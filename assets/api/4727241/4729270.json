{"by":"jaeysin","id":4729270,"parent":4727241,"text":"Afar Media | Full Time | San Francisco<p>Afar Media is a collaborative travel guide as well as a printed travel magazine. I'm the lead engineer for a three-person team, and we're looking to add a front-end developer. We use Rails 3, Slim and all the attendant technologies (jQuery, CoffeeScript, drinking lots of coffee). Lately, we've been using Ember.js, which is awesome.\nI'll paste below our official post, but let me say up front why I think this is a great job.\n- We work reasonable hours and we're paid well for our time. (No nebulous promises of worthless equity for infinite hours at the desk.)\n- We believe in travel so strongly that we pay you to do it. That is, each employee gets a yearly travel stipend and three weeks vacation to use it. The only caveat is it must be international travel and it must be to a city you've never visited before. (Note: this is an awesome caveat.)\n- Live somewhere else in the US? Maybe we could work something out about working remotely transition into working in the office. (Maybe. Tell us what's up. I started working remotely from Chicago before moving to SF.)<p>---- Begin Official Description ----\nAFAR Media is a well-funded travel media start-up spanning print and web. We have big monitors, stand-up desks, and fancy new laptops. Your coworkers will be be developers, designers, project mangers, and (this is the cool part) magazine editors, meaning you'll work with a wider ranger of personalities than the standard developer scrum.\nThis job is ideal for someone who loves to travel for fun (the position does not require travel, but a fulfilling life does, and one of our great perks is a yearly travel stipend). No arbitrary requirements here, if you are an expert or a least have a hacking willingness to learn and have a good attitude, we want you. Our team is small, and all opinions are considered (and frankly, needed) from product design through delivery.\nCheck out our site: <a href=\"http://www.afar.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.afar.com</a> If you are interested, please send an email to jobs@afar.com, including relevant experience and work.","time":1351798408,"type":"comment"}
