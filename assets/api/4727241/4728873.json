We're a 10-week intense training program for junior software developers.<p>We want to build the best learning environment, period.<p>Do you love to teach?  Hone your craft?  Share the joy of coding with others?  DBC is the rare place where all of these efforts align.  Spend a week diving deep with a new technology -- and then teach 50 students hungry to hear everything about it.<p>Since starting at DBC I've improved as a developer 10x, and the challenge of building the a learning environment is the hardest problem I've yet to face in my career.<p>Some of my favorite things about DBC:<p>1. Our students are our customers.  They pay us, expect us to change their lives, and hold us accountable to that.<p>2. Our customers sit 50 feet from us.  This is the tightest, fastest feedback loop I've ever seen.<p>3. Our internal software is awesome.  We're building a real-time classroom and learning environment -- a huge technical and design challenge.<p>4. Our students tell us that this is the best learning environment they've ever been in<p>5. The staff at DBC would die for these students, but we know how to have fun.  This is both the most intense and most light-hearted, fun workplace I've ever been a part of.<p>6. We're growing.  So fast.<p>Want to come and play with us?  Email jesse at devbootcamp.com and show me why you love coding and teaching. :)","time":1351793653,"type":"comment"}
