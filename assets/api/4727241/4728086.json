We all work remotely to some degree (I work from Miami every other month, and we have devs in Hawaii and Colorado), and those on our team who weren't impacted by Sandy are working at coffee shops, libraries, and apartments across the five boroughs.<p>Feel free to ask me any questions @achompas on Twitter.","time":1351784656,"type":"comment"}
