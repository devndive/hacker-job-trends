The working environment is pretty flexible - while we work hard, we don't really have fixed hours and people are encouraged to work from home if it helps their productivity.<p>We're solving some really challenging technical problems across the whole stack, including deep integration with legacy banking systems, which brings its own set of challenges.<p>We're backed by Y Combinator, Accel Partners &#38; Passion Capital, and we pay competitive salaries + stock.<p>We're looking for a Ruby developer who can work in our office in central London - for a full job spec, please see <a href=\"https://gocardless.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gocardless.com/jobs</a><p>Email tom@gocardless.com to apply.
