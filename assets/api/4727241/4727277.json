Full-time.<p>The Ksplice group at Oracle<p>Does writing Python clones of your favorite childhood computer games sound like a fun weekend project? Would you hack on an old-school graphics demo that fits into a DOS MBR in your free time? Have you ever told a joke whose punch line was a git command? If that sounds like you, we want to hear from you!<p>We are a small, tight-knit team of 12 women and men excited to work on technology that most people will tell you is impossible: updating an operating system kernel while it is running. Our product, Ksplice Uptrack, is a subscription service for Linux that provides completely non-disruptive, rebootless kernel updates. (You can read more about the underlying technology at <a href=\"http://www.ksplice.com/paper\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ksplice.com/paper</a>)<p>We're looking for a systems engineer with strong Python experience: Help us bring the Ksplice Uptrack client to new Linux distribution releases, improve our server infrastructure, and develop and extend our REST API and Django-based web interface.<p>If this technology excites you, let's talk! Feel free to direct questions to me at jamie.iles@oracle.com or to jobs@ksplice.com. Oracle is an equal opportunity employer.","time":1351775503,"type":"comment"}
