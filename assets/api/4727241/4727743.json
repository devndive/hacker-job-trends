We just announced a $1mm+ funding round and are looking for anyone comfortable with the full stack, though specialization is cool as well. No formal requirements, except that you have a history of hacking and getting sh*t done.<p>We have an increasingly varied tech stack and are using Python, Coffeescript/SASS, Backbone, RabbitMQ, Elastic Search, Redis, Node.js, and much much more. The right tool is the right tool, new tech doesn't scare us.<p>We have to solve some interesting problems, for example, every API has different rate limit, so how do you schedule jobs that keep us under the limit, both globally and per-user? We also believe in the power of open source, we've released two OS Django apps already, we'd hope you would want to do the same.<p>Also, customers love us and we're making money.<p>If you want to chat, just contact us at founders@zapier.com (no recruiters please).","time":1351780908,"type":"comment"}
