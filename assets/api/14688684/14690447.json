Our web&#x2F;mobile-web&#x2F;sms-based software automates the process of checking in with patients before and after major treatments. We&#x27;re starting out by using validated surveys to measure changes in symptoms, function and quality of life over time and bring that data back to the point-of-care to close the loop, enable proactive decision making and help practices navigate the shift from volume to value.<p>We have a HIPAA compliant MVP that is already used by practices and a grant funded project with UCSF. We&#x27;ve bootstrapped to where we are today and have an incredibly clean cap table. As a committed full-time physician founder I&#x27;m now looking for an ambitious technical partner who can really help drive the business forward, put us in the sweet spot to raise some initial funding and grow the team. I&#x27;m looking for someone who:<p>- Is startup ready: willing and able to get their hands dirty, take on the risk that an early stage startup involves in return for real founder-level equity and little or no pay until we raise funding. Not someone wanting to sit on the fence until it takes off.<p>- Has the right skills: Fluent in JavaScript, experience working across the stack but more than anything else a history of building, curiosity and learning with a need to create something great.<p>- Is the right fit: Experience nice but not necessary, however an active interest in improving healthcare is a must. Someone who enjoys building teams and helping people grow.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in learning more please contact me at francis@outcomes.com","time":1499107232,"type":"comment"}
