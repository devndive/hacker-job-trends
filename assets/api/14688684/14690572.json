We require deep understanding of operating systems and networks fundamentals, practical knowledge of Linux and a healthy desire to automate everything while being able to quickly resolve urgent issues manually.<p>Ahrefs runs an internet-scale bot that crawls the whole Web, storing huge volumes of information to be indexed and structured in a timely fashion. Backend system is powered by a custom petabyte-scale distributed key-value storage to accommodate all that data coming in at high speed. On top of that Ahrefs is building various analytical services for end-users.<p>We are a small team and strongly believe in better technology leading to better solutions for real-world problems. We worship functional languages and static typing, extensively employ code generation and meta-programming, value code clarity and predictability, and are constantly seeking to automate repetitive tasks and eliminate boilerplate, guided by DRY and following KISS. If there is any new technology that will make our life easier - no doubt, we&#x27;ll give it a try. We rely heavily on opensource code (as the only viable way to build maintainable system) and contribute back [1]. Occasionally we track down CPU bugs [2].<p>Our motto is &quot;first do it, then do it right, then do it better&quot;.\nDrop an email to connect@ahrefs.com<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ahrefs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ahrefs</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.ahrefs.com&#x2F;skylake-bug-a-detective-story-ab1ad2beddcd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.ahrefs.com&#x2F;skylake-bug-a-detective-story-ab1ad2...</a>","time":1499108467,"type":"comment"}
