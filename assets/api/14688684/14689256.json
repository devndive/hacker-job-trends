We aim to build a well-rounded team and we&#x27;re looking for engineers with a deep Linux systems background, strong TCP&#x2F;IP networking abilities, and experience building  CI&#x2F;CD pipelines.  This is not an entry-level DevOps position; this role requires senior-level skills and at least six years of experience working in a production environment.<p>We&#x27;re a modern infrastructure engineering team and we build many tools in-house, so you will need to demonstrate proficiency in a one of the languages commonly used for infrastructure : Go (strongly preferred), Ruby, Python, or Java.  Experience with app containerization (Docker or rkt) and orchestration systems (Kubernetes) is a big plus!<p>Sound interesting?  Please reach out to me by applying here:  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;wealthfront&#x2F;d2e9b730-ebad-4331-ae41-be8a9651f735\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;wealthfront&#x2F;d2e9b730-ebad-4331-ae41-be...</a>","time":1499097786,"type":"comment"}
