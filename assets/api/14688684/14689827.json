We are currently on the hunt for mid&#x2F;senior front end developers, especially those with a more creative side.\nWe don&#x27;t put our developers in a box, but expect them to be involved from strategy to delivery, working collaboratively with the entire team to find unique solutions to some amazing briefs. To help facilitate this we have our own bar in the office (with no locks on the fridge!) and the cupboards are always stocked with snacks and treats. Most importantly we have an awesome development and creative team in place and are looking for more like-minded people who will keep pushing the agency forward.<p>A small sample of the technologies, languages and frameworks we use include AngularJS, Three.js, Django, Flask and Google App Engine. Some recent projects we&#x27;ve worked on include a Cardboard VR Experience for Google (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phantom.land&#x2F;work&#x2F;petra&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phantom.land&#x2F;work&#x2F;petra&#x2F;</a>) and an interactive piece for the TATE Modern featuring music by Sigur RÃ³s (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phantom.land&#x2F;work&#x2F;states-of-matter&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phantom.land&#x2F;work&#x2F;states-of-matter&#x2F;</a>).<p>Please check out our site (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phantom.land\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phantom.land</a>) for more info.
