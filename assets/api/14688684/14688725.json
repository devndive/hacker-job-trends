We are trying to make the threat intelligence process run more smoothly and help organizations share threat data better. We&#x27;re looking for a front-end developer to take over development of our applications UI (we&#x27;re in-housing development of the app after contracting it out for about a year). The front-end is built with React&#x2F;Microcosm&#x2F;Material&#x2F;Vis.js, and it talks to our backend using a mix of REST and WebSockets. Ideally, the person we&#x27;re looking for would be comfortable doing both the React programming side of things as well as the HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;layout work.<p>The job is based in the DC&#x2F;Alexandria area, but we do a lot of working from home. Also, since we have an existing contracting relationship for development, we&#x27;re very flexible about start dates. If you are at all interested, we encourage you to send us a note.<p>Please email a resume and some examples (or urls) of your work to aaron@kingandunion.com","time":1499094191,"type":"comment"}
