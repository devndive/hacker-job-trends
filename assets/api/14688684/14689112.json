That means we help companies figure out how to do all the steps that come after writing code. How do you test that code? How do you deploy it? How do you monitor it? How do you keep it secure?<p>It turns out that many, many companies are are struggling with these questions, and we need to grow our company to keep up with demand. We are distributed (work from anywhere), bootstrapped (no investor pressure), family-friendly (no crazy hours), trying to build a diverse team (people of all backgrounds, genders, races, cultures, and ethnicities are welcome), and profitable (we work with some of the biggest brands in the world).<p>We&#x27;re looking for a senior or veteran full-stack engineer interested in engineering a fundamentally better DevOps experience to join as the 4th member of the team&#x2F;employee #2. If that&#x27;s you, email us at careers@gruntwork.io.<p>For more info, see the blog post we wrote when we were looking for employee #1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.gruntwork.io&#x2F;gruntwork-is-hiring-devops-engineers-c268513a0b5a\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.gruntwork.io&#x2F;gruntwork-is-hiring-devops-enginee...</a>","time":1499096880,"type":"comment"}
