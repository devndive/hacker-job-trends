Also, I&#x27;m usually remote from my home in the San Diego area but I&#x27;m in SF for the next couple of weeks so if anyone&#x27;s interested in Elation specifically or healthcare startups in general (I&#x27;ve been doing those since &#x27;99 or so), I&#x27;m particularly available to grab coffee and meet folks.
