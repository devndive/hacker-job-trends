The role allows for occasional working from home but we are principally looking for somebody willing to live and work in London.<p>Our goal is creating new platforms exposing RESTful services to the IoE&#x2F;M2M industry, capitalizing on our experience and digital real estate from the SSL and PKI spaces. We have already built a game changing system and are now looking at augmenting it both performance and feature-wise.<p>On a day to day basis you will be creating new high performance platforms for both internal and external use, exposed in a RESTful fashion and backed by large NoSQL data stores. Part of this will include prototyping new technologies, interacting with PKI&#x2F;crypto hardware, and shaving off microseconds wherever possible.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.jobscore.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;globalsign&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;backend-software-engineer-a3LHnawkqr5z6LeMg-44q7\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.jobscore.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;globalsign&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;backend...</a>","time":1499162981,"type":"comment"}
