We build the API for iPlayer (the video one, not the radio one), which is used by the Mobile Apps, TV Apps, Website and syndication partners such as Sky &amp; Virgin - last week we counted 1 billion requests.\nWe&#x27;re also looking after the Apple TV app (TVML), some open source programs and a number of internal tools for our editorial staff.<p>At the moment we&#x27;re extending our personalisation capabilities with some audience research and exciting ML projects and would love someone to help us build the best VoD &amp; live content platform to come out of the UK.<p>PS: Because I&#x27;m not a fan of how we advertise salaries, I&#x27;m going to point out this FOI request which shows last year&#x27;s salary bands for &quot;G9&quot;.
