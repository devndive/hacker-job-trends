We help tech savvy buyers shop for homes with expert online support, then save them a ton of money with a 50% commission refund. We&#x27;re assisting hundreds of thousands of active buyers and transacting more than one home each day.<p>Today our software plugs into the existing real estate market via broker-quality data feeds and a network of local real estate agents. We have a web&#x2F;app feed that helps users house hunt, back-of-house software that helps agents manage transactions, and custom support tools that allow our small team to assist thousands of active buyers through the process. We take a pragmatic, piecemeal approach to crafting software with heavy emphasis on testing, measurement, and iteration.<p>Our stack is rails, react, webpack, and mongodb with a heavy peppering of AWS goodies. The only tool we’re dogmatic about is simplicity. You should be comfortable developing the full critical path of a new web feature, but we’re most excited about front end web and&#x2F;or native app expertise.<p>Projects we&#x27;re excited about:<p>- Review + capacity management system for on-demand showing agents so that we can get tour lead-time down to 1 hour in major markets<p>- Deeper automation of the offer and closing process with online offer tracking throughout the entire buying process<p>- Full rebuild of our iOS app (react-native)<p>- Refreshed look and feel with consistent atomic style guide<p>- Personalized recommendations<p>What we&#x27;re looking for from you:<p>- A BS in Computer Science or equivalent experience (not fresh out of bootcamp, sorry)<p>- Experience building a well-designed app<p>- A bias for building your way out of a problem<p>- Optimism about future technology and automation<p>- Good references from past colleagues","time":1499102227,"type":"comment"}
