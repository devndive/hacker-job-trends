We teach the concepts behind the code, then help students build projects until everything clicks. We think about online learning in a vertically integrated way, from the actual learning content and the product all the way to job preparation. Students with no programming and just high school math backgrounds have gone from 0 to job ready and have gotten jobs at companies like SpaceX, and our NPS is around 60.<p>We don&#x27;t believe in skimming the surface of concepts so that students just know what to type. We build intuition around complicated ideas like random forests from the ground up. We walk students through building their own algorithms, so we can help them understand the tradeoffs and limitations of techniques. We help students build projects, so they can solidify their knowledge and get real-world experience.<p>While so far we&#x27;ve mostly focused on teaching data science through Python, we&#x27;re looking for someone to help us extend and enhance our R content. This involves writing instructional content, creating projects, thinking about how to improve how we teach, mentoring students directly, and getting feedback from students to improve our teaching methods. If you have:<p>- experience writing R code (whether on the job or your own packages)<p>- experience writing technical data science content<p>- a strong a data science foundation<p>- a deep interest in teaching<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone who shares our mission of giving people access to high quality education at a low cost. You&#x27;ll have a lot of latitude to shape how we teach, and to help build a personalized educational platform. We&#x27;re bootstrapped and profitable, so this is also a chance to learn more about the business side.<p>If this is interesting, please email srini at dataquest.io.","time":1499098504,"type":"comment"}
