Primary care providers in America are struggling under excess administrative burdens and excess demand. There are over 1 billion primary care visits in the United States every year, and we aim to improve the quality and efficiency of every single one of them.<p>Canvas was founded in 2015 to rebuild the technology infrastructure for primary care providers. This includes core medical record technology as well as patient-facing and insurer-facing products. Canvas is venture-backed, headquartered in San Francisco, and currently has less than ten people on the team.<p>We&#x27;re looking for front-end and full-stack developers. Our typical toolset is React+Redux, Webpack, Django, Python, Docker, and Linux on AWS. We value passion, pragmatism, discipline, domain-driven design, and testing until youâ€™re confident. We also believe that communication and empathy are core competencies for people who build technology.<p>Email me at engineering@canvasmedical.com","time":1499097183,"type":"comment"}
