Our cloud-based platform does this by capturing customer feedback, analyzing it in real-time, and then delivering it to everyone in a company — from the c-suite to the frontline — to help them improve. We’re now considered the leaders in a space we helped to create, we’re Sequoia backed, and we’re growing like crazy — doubling in size every 12 months. We’ve got a culture focused on smarts, kindness, continual learning, and irreverence.<p>Medallia is hiring for a full range of positions, both technical and non-technical. Our engineers are tackling once-thought-to-be-impossible data challenges, our client teams are working with some of the world’s best brands, and our sales and marketing teams are selling into an explosive market.<p>We’d love to talk:<p>Engineering: <a href=\"http://engineering.medallia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;engineering.medallia.com&#x2F;</a><p>Biz: <a href=\"http://www.medallia.com/job-department/business/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medallia.com&#x2F;job-department&#x2F;business&#x2F;</a>","time":1412372268,"type":"comment"}
