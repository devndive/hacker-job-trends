Our office overlooks the farms and mountains in Chilliwack, British Columbia. You’re far enough from Vancouver to avoid the congestion, but close enough to attend industry events.<p>We need a software developer who can handle the whole stack. You use BSD sockets in the morning and WebSockets after lunch. Your toolbox includes gdb, jsPerf.com, and everything in between. You’re at home with Less- both the pager and the stylesheet language. Your colleagues love you because your software is clear, cohesive, and unit tested, and your users adore you because your UIs are tested and proven effective. You know the meaning of CAP_NET_ADMIN and CSRF. Your apps run on a 10 year old machine with 256 MB of memory, then scale up to a 32 GB server built yesterday. We don’t care if you know our stack, because you learn quickly (and our training program doesn&#x27;t hurt, either).<p>E-mail me at matt.fox@multapplied.net.","time":1412751203,"type":"comment"}
