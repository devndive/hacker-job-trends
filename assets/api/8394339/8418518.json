This includes full-stack, frontend, backend, and mobile engineers. Join our team, come in at the ground level, and shape a product with great potential to transform an enormous market!<p>So far, we are using HTML5, iOS, Android, Go, App Engine, and AWS.  Our founders were part of Google and Dropbox and are building an engineering-led culture.<p>Cars are the largest retail vertical in the US – consumers buy almost 50 million new and used cars every year, totaling $1 trillion in value. Yet technology has barely touched the market; Americans buy cars in the same, burdensome ways they did decades ago. Selling a car means either letting the dealer collect a huge margin in a trade-in, or significant hassle selling to a private party. Our goal is to create a delightful experience for every person buying and selling a car, similar to Tesla’s customer service.<p>Shift is well-funded, has strong partnerships with key strategic players across the value chain, and has done dozens of sales in San Francisco. We are lean and hypothesis-driven, led by engineering and design. We work hard together, have fun together, and our culture is healthy and respectful.<p>enghiring@shiftcars.com","time":1412632186,"type":"comment"}
