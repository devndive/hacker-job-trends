The company culture is fantastic. The people are great to work with. The Boston office feels like a startup because it&#x27;s so small and new, yet we&#x27;re well-funded and secure. Everywhere I go people tell me they love our product or know someone who loves it and talks about it.<p>Boston Software Engineers: <a href=\"http://jobvite.com/m?35Rglgwi\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobvite.com&#x2F;m?35Rglgwi</a><p>San Francisco Software Engineers: <a href=\"http://jobvite.com/m?3XSglgwb\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobvite.com&#x2F;m?3XSglgwb</a><p>San Francisco Hardware Engineers: <a href=\"http://jobvite.com/m?3kVhlgwC\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobvite.com&#x2F;m?3kVhlgwC</a><p>If you&#x27;re really good but none of those positions seems to exactly fit you, apply anyway. New projects are emerging with big data, new products, and other ideas. Feel free to reply with general-interest questions. Personal inquiries can be emailed to me, blewis at the obvious domain.<p>In Site Engineering, we&#x27;re using jQuery, Bootstrap, underscore, Handlebars, Backbone, Stylus, Buster, Selenium, requirejs, and Highcharts on the front end, with new technologies introduced as needed. We&#x27;re only using node as part of the build system for now. The back end is tomcat with a lot of Spring and Hibernate in front of mysql.\nSome big data projects I&#x27;m aware of also use Python. Beyond that, check job listings to know what tools might be used.","time":1412193461,"type":"comment"}
