We are venture funded, recently won the Qualcomm QPrize, and have a fantastic slate of paying customers.<p>We have a number of fun projects in-progress: RF&#x2F;embedded design for satellite receivers, modeling&#x2F;algorithm design for GPS estimation and control problems, functional programming (Haskell!) for platform infrastructure, and compilers&#x2F;tools for performance-critical embedded code generation.<p>We&#x27;re currently looking for a __product-focused engineer__\ninterested in embedded systems prototyping but also in\ncollaborating with many of our existing customers in research and industry to improve our main product (<a href=\"http://swiftnav.com/piksi.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;swiftnav.com&#x2F;piksi.html</a>). This role will be\nparticularly important as we expand the availability of\nhigh-accuracy GPS into entirely new markets (UAVs, machine \nautomation, agriculture).<p>For next year: __interns__, particularly anyone interested in\ngetting some independent project experience with some of the\nprojects above.<p>If you&#x27;d like to apply, send a note to jobs@swiftnav.com. iI\nyou&#x27;re awesome and really want to contribute in some other way not listed? Let us know!
