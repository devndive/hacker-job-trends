We&#x27;re looking for a Python developer to help abstract our systems into a general platform for open making.<p>Because our products are designed for digital fabrication, they can be downloaded and made locally anywhere in the world.

We&#x27;re using Python (Pyramid, SQLAlchemy) and Postgres with a Vagrant dev environment, currently deploying to Heroku in production. New feature development is through standalone WSGI apps, with API backend and Angular JS client. We need your help to build, improve and evolve our current website and systems into what we hope will become an Etsy-scale transactional platform delivering digital designs for distributed manufacturing.<p>We&#x27;re based in London. You can work here or anywhere in the world, as long as you can be online for a good chunk of the UK working day. We&#x27;re flexible on full-time vs part-time and salary vs contract.
