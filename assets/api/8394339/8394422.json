Our flagship product is an online LaTeX editor that makes it trivial to get started with LaTeX and collaborate with your colleagues. Students and scientists love us, and now we’re looking to expand our team so that we can solve similar workflow problems in data analysis and numerical modelling (using Python and R).<p>You should be comfortable quickly learning new technologies and enthusiastic about improving the efficiency of scientists and their tools. Our current technology stack involves Node.js, MongoDB, Redis, Coffeescript, Angular.js, and Docker, so experience in these is useful but not required. We’d rather see that you have demonstrable interest in the problems we are solving, and that you’ve created some great stuff in the past.<p>Some reasons you&#x27;d enjoy working for us:<p>* Around 80% of our codebase is open-source and we’re big fans of free software.<p>* We’re agile (with a lower case a). We test everything (unit and acceptance), we have a CI build process, a full staging environment to play with, and we automate as much as possible.<p>* We don’t expect you to have to fill up a 9-5, 40 hour work week. A work&#x2F;life balance is important and we don’t think programming is an activity that can be neatly time boxed.<p>* You can work fully remotely (in fact, you probably will). The founders work remotely already.<p>* We’re a bootstrapped company with no outside investors.<p>Send me an email: james@sharelatex.com","time":1412172841,"type":"comment"}
