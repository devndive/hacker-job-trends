What sounds like a\nboring problem actually requires quite a sophisticated approach - PDF&#x27;s usually\ndon&#x27;t have much in the way of useful structural information in them.<p>As an engineer at ScraperWiki I can honestly say this is the most fun place I\nhave worked. My office offers an environment of self-determination, a chance to\nexplore all areas of the stack from product development to technical development, operations, security, product design and user experience.<p>We have a generous holiday package and a guy in the office called Dragon. He\nhas a giant fluffy red beard and long hair and is generally an awesome guy.<p>What more could one ask?<p>We build things in Python, Go and Node, using Github, EC2 and salt - to name a\nfew things. Of you, we don&#x27;t ask anything specific, but hopefully you can\ndemonstrate to us some decent experience in building interesting things. We\nwould expect someone who at least had a year or two&#x27;s experience with Python\nor experience equivalent to that.<p>You can contact me personally or our CEO. Bonus points if you can crack the\npuzzle:<p><pre><code>  UHR2IyNRbmJ6bCppaS1KfXF2fX1nMjZ+djluc3k9bWpCS0d\n  AUAVJQQhQRV5eDUsCXVBbXxRBWRdLUF1VXVEeSyggNmM9Kj\n  NnKzsrKCcoKm8kOTsgdG9&#x2F;</code></pre>","time":1412197852,"type":"comment"}
