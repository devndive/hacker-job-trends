Actually, we&#x27;ve already built a ton of it.  In fact, it hums along running a few billion transactions per day.  As our business expands, we a few roles to fill:<p>1) We need a Rails dev to own our campaign management interface. You&#x27;ll help humans effectively manage hundreds of campaigns for well-known brands and retailers. We serve 50+ million ads every day and process 3.5 billion transactions, and you&#x27;ll be right in the thick of it. You&#x27;ll work directly with Postgres, Redis, HBase and Hadoop. You&#x27;ll also likely play a key role in developing a new API for several key partners.<p>2) We need someone with fierce tenacity to run QA and technical ad operations. When an account manager sees that we recorded no clicks for a certain campaign in Firefox browsers, you&#x27;ll get to hunt down the resolution. You&#x27;d bring a meticulous eye for detail to bear with browser and Javascript chops. Done well, you&#x27;ll be a daily hero. (Devs are cheerful when called upon to fight fires, but prefer to write code.) Count on becoming well acquainted with Hive.<p>3) Finally, we&#x27;re looking for a strong DevOps team member. You know networking and Linux very well. You&#x27;ll help improve our Hadoop clusters. You&#x27;ll tune monitoring and alerting thresholds. Most importantly, you&#x27;ll eagerly seek to expand your usefulness as you work with the rest of the dev team. We&#x27;re not driven by dogma, and you&#x27;ll find yourself in good company if your sole priority is fixing the problem at hand.<p>I&#x27;m one of the lead devs, and you can reach me at dlarsen@connexity.com. I&#x27;m happy to speak informally about our situation, and can hook you up with the HR folk at the appropriate time.","time":1412192800,"type":"comment"}
