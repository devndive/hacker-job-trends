You’d be developing web sites, building web applications and solving painful problems for a growing group of clients, primarily in the financial services industry.<p>We’re a small team in Brooklyn, so you’d have plenty of control over your workflow, technologies and tools. Our focus is on the end user - quality user interface and excellent user experience - and we’re open to whatever technologies and approaches will achieve that. However, almost all of our existing code is in PHP, so a strong knowledge of object-oriented PHP is a must.<p>The job is focused on the back end, but some front end chops are necessary. We value clean code and good practices, but our primary interest is in your ability to execute and ship working solutions.<p>We’re looking for a new team member that is driven and constantly looking for new challenges but at the same time thorough in execution and attentive to details. This is a full-time position based out of our office located at the intersection of residential Williamsburg (yes, that one) and industrial Bushwick. We have a large loft space bathed in light, filled with plants and all the espresso you can drink.<p>All the details at: <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/69059/web-developer-at-a-brooklyn-studio-pointpath-studios\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;69059&#x2F;web-developer-at...</a>","time":1412174055,"type":"comment"}
