We're a small team of 7, with $1.6mm in funding from some of the best investors in the valley (Jeff Clavier, Ron Conway, General Catalyst, Mitch Kapor...), and we're one of the fastest growing education companies of all time. Paul Graham invested in us, but we didn't do YC.<p>In our first year, we've built a product that makes a real difference to the world, and is used by millions of teachers and students every day. We're about to take it to the next level, hopefully with you on board! 2 key people we're looking for:<p><pre><code>  - Full-stack engineer: we use node.js/MongoDB - there are some really interesting challenges to solve as we scale to millions more users every month!\n  \n  - Front-end engineer: you'll use JavaScript and Backbone.js to lead development of a webapp that is already seen and used in more than 100 countries.  \n</code></pre>\nYou can find out more about our work and our culture (and all the perks!) here: <a href=\"http://www.classdojo.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.classdojo.com/jobs</a>. If you're a strong hacker who wants to join a strong technical team at the earliest stages of a high-growth startup - and use JavaScript to improve education - you should join us :) you can apply here:<p><pre><code>  --------------------------  \n  \n  https://classdojo.wufoo.com/forms/join-classdojo/  \n  \n  --------------------------    </code></pre>\nOr just drop me an email directly, and we can chat!
