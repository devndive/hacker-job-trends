The current opening is for a software engineer with a broad range of talents.<p>For example we're currently working on mobile applications (Android), embedded computing (Arduino, chipKIT, PIC32, ARM Cortex M3), web applications (Flask, Django), the CAN bus, NFC and other networking research. We also do a lot of physical prototyping of electronics and housings - we're talking PCB design, 3D printing and the like.<p>The best candidates are those with a few years of experience in a professional environment or new grads with lots of cool projects under their belt. We love open source and are pushing the company in new and more open directions.<p>Don't let the big corporation name scare you away - the research team operates with much of the freedom to experiment of a smaller company, but with the benefits of large corporate backing (eg. if you need it to get your job done, we can buy it).","time":1357243094,"type":"comment"}
