We have just started to build our engineering team focusing on growth, marketing and business development efforts in our San Francisco office (product development is in our other office in Budapest, Hungary with about 40 engineers).<p>Some exciting tasks ahead: build quick prototypes that drive growth; high performance web development (both from a backend and frontend perspective); backend systems for marketing campaigns (and their respective frontend work of course); content management system on our main website; integration with 3rd party providers (e.g. Salesforce).<p>About our technology stack: we primarily use Python/Django in the backend, but we also have Scala and Haskell in production. Frontend is LESS (built on top of Bootstrap), and JavaScript (jQuery) with some CoffeeScript.<p>Why Prezi? We are a profitable (but also well-funded) company that's been around for more than 4 years now, with more than 18 million registered users. We have 100 employees, but the SF office is still pretty small (20 people). We don't track holidays, benefits include health, dental and vision. You get to travel to Budapest, Hungary at least twice a year, a city well-known for its baths and ruin pubs. You have extra budget for personal improvement (books, conferences, etc.)<p>Application form: <a href=\"https://hire.jobvite.com/Jobvite/Apply.aspx?b=nu7Ahjwg&#38;j=oIK4Vfwb\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://hire.jobvite.com/Jobvite/Apply.aspx?b=nu7Ahjwg&#38;j...</a><p>See <a href=\"http://prezi.com/jobs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://prezi.com/jobs/</a> for more info and other open positions.<p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact me: szilveszter@prezi.com","time":1357070293,"type":"comment"}
