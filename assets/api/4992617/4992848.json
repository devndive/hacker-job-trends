(INTERN ok)<p>Django Developers at Wildfish, <a href=\"http://wildfish.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wildfish.com</a><p>We're an independent London based Django consultancy looking to expand our team.  We work on web applications for startups, other clients, and our own hairbrain schemes.  We've mostly been working with freelancers, but are now looking to start putting together a permanent team to take things to the next level.  We're all developers, so understand the things which are important and which aren't.<p>Our office is in London Bridge, so you'll need to be within occasional commute distance of there, but a mixture of remote on site work seems to work best for most of us, so that's fine too.<p>These are some of the technologies we're working with, so please mention any experience, skills or interest in any of them:<p>- Python\n- Django\n- Testing (TDD, nose, django-webtest, factory-boy)\n- gevent, gevent-socketio\n- Ubuntu Linux server admin (Linode, AWS, Fabric, Salt, Nginx)\n- PostgreSQL, Redis\n- Django CMSs (Django CMS 2, FeinCMS, Mezzanine, others)\n- HTML/CSS/Bootstrap\n- Javascript (and any frameworks)<p>It's more important that someone can demonstrate they know their stuff rather than have lots of commercial experience necessarily, so please include any links which might show that (other projects/Github/HackerNews/SO, etc).<p>We'd also like someone who's interested in helping us build the profile of the company but contributing back to the community, including paid time contributing to open source projects, writing blog posts, and developing our own internal infrastructure or cool things you or we may dream up.<p>Please email contact@wildfish.com with your details and salary expectations.  Would possibly also consider those interested in part time work.<p>Thanks!","time":1357055950,"type":"comment"}
