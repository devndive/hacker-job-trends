We interact positively and openly and emphasize learning and professional development. These attributes have enabled us to produce an industry-leading product with a globally recognizable and satisfied client base. Our environment is relaxed and fun, we play everything from Total Annihilation to Alien Swarm at our game nights, and we equip everyone with new quad-core Thinkpads with SSDs and dual monitors.
