We are looking to fill 3 positions:<p>Front-End/UI Engineer - Must have a good attention to detail and be able to use and contribute to a large, modular Javascript codebase (built on dojo). Good understanding of HTML/CSS/Javascript is a must, and a good eye for design is a nice bonus. We support only modern browsers (no IE6 headaches), so we have a very rich HTML/Javascript interface that relies on AJAX queries to pull down data and perform much of the work.<p>Software Engineer - With just 2.5 programmers right now (our CEO has a CS PhD but a lot of other responsibilities), we all wear many hats. Our server is written in Java 7 and runs on the latest Jetty. We use Hibernate and Spring with annotation-based configuration (minimal XML). We use Lucene for indexing documents, Cassandra for logging and searching user events, MySQL for storing relational data, and it all runs on AWS technologies. We have a separate Python codebase for performing offline work. We strive to write all of our code in a modular, reusable style that maximizes code-sharing and minimizes repetition. We schedule weekly time for refactoring so that we avoid the accumulation of technical debt. If you're sharp and you're interested in learning how to write performant code that uses modern academic research and operates on the latest infrastructure, you'll like this role.<p>Systems Engineer - We deal with many terabytes of data. We just recently ordered a 48-bay fileserver (basically a more robust, beefed-up BackBlaze pod) to handle our expanding storage needs over the next couple years. We need someone with Unix experience who is comfortable in Python to help us work more efficiently. You'll manage our AWS installations, manage our internal systems, and help make our entire setup more robust. We're happy to hire someone with solid fundamentals who wants to learn on the job.<p>Salary is competitive with other Bay-area startups. We also offer equity, healthcare, 3 weeks of vacation and 10 holidays, and a relaxed and fun work environment.<p>We consider all applicants; please apply for the position(s) you're interested in at <a href=\"http://easyesi.com/jobs.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://easyesi.com/jobs.shtml</a>.","time":1357168878,"type":"comment"}
