When you look at the automotive landscape and realize that no one has ever applied big data or computer science to try and fix the problem, we&#x27;re looking at a $500bn industry that’s ripe for disruption. We&#x27;re a team of highly collaborative and product focused engineers who are passionate about bringing trust, transparency, and quality user experiences to this broken market, and have started the charge with a great mix of folks from Google, Dropbox, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other top companies.<p>Our backend is in Go running on Google App Engine and utilizing REST APIs. We&#x27;re building our front end in React using ES2015 transpiled with Babel. We also have a CRM backend on Salesforce, with an iOS app built on top of this to help our ops team price, inspect, deal with contracts, and logistics. Our mobile presence is mainly iOS at the moment, which we’re using Swift for, and we do plan to venture into Android as we continue to build the team. We&#x27;re running a Postgres database on RDS.<p>Current openings:\nMobile Engineers (iOS &amp; Android) - SF &amp; DC\nSoftware Engineers - SF &amp; DC\nFront-end Engineer - SF\nInfrastructure Engineer - SF\nEngineering Manager - DC<p>To apply: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;shift.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;shift.com&#x2F;jobs</a> OR send your CV to: enghiring [at] shift.com<p>More info: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;job-portraits&#x2F;shift-is-tackling-the-ultimate-ux-challenge-the-750b-used-car-market-c975e303102#.62dhs3bm0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;job-portraits&#x2F;shift-is-tackling-the-ultim...</a>\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;4018160&#x2F;shift-review-sell-your-car&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;4018160&#x2F;shift-review-sell-your-car&#x2F;</a>\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;the-25-hottest-san-francisco-startups-to-watch-in-2016-2016-1?op=0#&#x2F;#shift-wants-to-become-the-largest-car-company-in-the-us-without-owning-a-single-vehicle-23\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;the-25-hottest-san-francisco-...</a>","time":1456948215,"type":"comment"}
