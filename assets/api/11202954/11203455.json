We saw a huge growth in demand last year and we&#x27;re hiring so we can keep up! We&#x27;re honestly and literally working with the bleeding edge of technology, so if that&#x27;s interesting to you, drop us a line! We&#x27;re currently hiring:<p>* Hadoop DevOps<p>* Scala Engineers<p>* Front End Developers (lots o&#x27; Javascript)<p>* Hadoop Experts<p>As a front end developer here, I have to say this is pretty much the best job I&#x27;ve ever had. Hands down. We use systems and processes that work for us, rather than simply being blindly adherent to some pre-defined process. Everyone has a lot of authority and autonomy, everyone has a <i>huge</i> impact on the product, and its just good work. We&#x27;re working on legitimately complicated problems, and they&#x27;re hugely fun to solve. It&#x27;s not the kind of work that&#x27;s fit for everyone, but if you&#x27;re interested in this kind of thing, I think this is really the pinnacle of what&#x27;s out there.<p>You can check out the careers page at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atscale.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atscale.com&#x2F;careers</a>, or feel free to just ask me whatever at james@atscale.com.","time":1456847814,"type":"comment"}
