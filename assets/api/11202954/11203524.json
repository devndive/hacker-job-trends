We have our headquarters in San Francisco, as well as offices in both Belgium and in the Netherlands where most of our engineering staff is based.<p>We&#x27;re currently developing a wearable sensor that pregnant women wear on their belly and which they can use to monitor maternal and fetal health (contractions, heart-rate, fetal kicks, etc.) using their smartphone. We can use this data to predict labor onset and high-risk pregnancies. A Beta version of our product is already available in an early access program in the US, and we are getting very positive feedback from both our customers and medical experts.<p>===== Who we are looking for =====<p>We are closing an investment round and are looking for talented people with experience and interest in:<p>* Mobile development (iOS (Swift) or&#x2F;and Android).<p>* Signal processing or&#x2F;and bio-engineering.<p>* Embedded systems or&#x2F;and low-level C programming.<p>Having some knowledge in machine learning and Python web development is a plus. We are still a small engineering team, so we&#x27;re looking for someone versatile and quick to pick up new skills. Because weâ€™re a startup with people in different continents, we need people who can be independent and flexible, but also offer flexibility concerning your work schedule, location, and holidays.<p>===== Interested? =====<p>Email me at raphael@bloom.life !<p>Thanks,\nRaphael.","time":1456848235,"type":"comment"}
