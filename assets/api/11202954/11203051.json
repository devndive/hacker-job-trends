Since then, we’ve been on the front page of Hacker News several times, collected around 7,000 Github stars and we&#x27;ve been funded by one of the top VC firms in the cloud infrastructure space (we’ll announce who soon).<p>Now, we’re doing something bigger. We’re looking for seasoned AWS infrastructure and React engineers to build a secretive, ambitious project that will potentially have a large impact on application delivery and open-source in general.<p>Though our company, and this project in particular, you will use cutting-edge technologies like AWS Lambda and GraphQL to solve longstanding problems with application delivery. Together, we will define new serverless&#x2F;event-driven architectural paradigms, and help all developers deliver scalable applications, efficiently. This is a fantastic experience if you are forward-looking and ambitious.<p>team@serverless.com","time":1456845170,"type":"comment"}
