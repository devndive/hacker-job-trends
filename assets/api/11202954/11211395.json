Catawiki hosts weekly auctions for collectors. Examples of past items we have auctioned off include a lock of Napoleon’s hair, a mammoth skeleton, various large meteorites, and the most expensive Lego set ever produced. In 2015, Catawiki won the Deloitte Fast500 as Europe’s fastest growing company. Every month, our website is visited millions of times by registered users worldwide.<p>Catawiki is looking for a Data Scientist to join its Data Science team. You will be responsible for performing advanced modeling and forecasting on a wide range of problems.<p>Catawiki is not a standard e-commerce company. Our data is fairly unique, because we have very high item churn. This results from the fact that we auction off rare and unique items run on a weekly basis, so we don’t have long timelines to accumulate data on items. Therefore, out-of-the-box techniques like CF recommender systems won’t work and you’ll have to get creative. In addition, there is a lot of value that can be created by enhancing our auctioneer productivity with machine learning techniques, for instance by ranking item supply on their expected closing price.<p>Full job description and apply: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.catawiki.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;job&#x2F;data-scientist?gh_jid=78118\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.catawiki.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;job&#x2F;data-scientist?gh_jid=78118</a>","time":1456939614,"type":"comment"}
