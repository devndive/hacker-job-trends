(SiteDocs headquarters are near Vancouver, but our dev team is spread throughout Canada and North America.)<p>We&#x27;re a growing B2B start-up with dozens of employees, thousands of users, and real revenue. Our mobile applications are built with Xamarin, and our web app is built with React, but we don&#x27;t necessarily care if you&#x27;ve worked with either before as long as you&#x27;re a good programmer who&#x27;s interested in (and reasonably good at) learning new things.<p>A job at SiteDocs means:<p>* Being responsible for your own piece of the product. We&#x27;re a relatively small team, and our product is relatively young, so the features and components you build will have a meaningful impact on our users&#x27; experiences.<p>* The opportunity to teach (for senior developers) and to learn (for junior developers). Our company values continuous learning, and as a dev team we are more than happy to hire and train programmers right out of university (or self taught, etc).<p>* Market salary. Honestly, we prefer hiring people in low cost-of-living areas and paying them slightly above-market for their location. But we also have team members who live in Vancouver, so ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯<p>If you&#x27;d like to talk, please email dave.noel@sitedocs.com with &quot;HN Hiring&quot; in the subject line.","time":1456848690,"type":"comment"}
