We do this already in London as Silicon Milkroundabout.<p>For our first New York event, we will host 100 teams including Vimeo, Moat, Managed by Q, Karhoo, Interworks, Cloudreach and Voodoo.<p>There&#x27;s space for up to 1,000 experienced software developers and data scientists, but spots are by invitation or application only.<p>The event is insanely cool. If you get in, you get access to the actual team members (founders, CTOs and the engineers themselves). For kicks we throw in a free bar, free daycare, free coffee, free snacks and live art.<p>If you&#x27;re a developer or data scientist in New York, apply for your ticket today and I&#x27;ll be in touch asap to let you know if your application has been successful .. It would be awesome to meet as many fellow HNers as possible!<p>Pete Smith<p>(hit me up if you have any questions: pete@theround.com)","time":1456853017,"type":"comment"}
