We&#x27;re a small company, so the responsibilities are varied, but initially you would be focused on our customer-facing website. We&#x27;re currently growing and refreshing our systems, so there would be a good deal of both responsibility and freedom in the position. If you&#x27;d like more information please don&#x27;t hesitate to get in touch.<p>Thanks!<p>David","time":1456852755,"type":"comment"}
