You want to be able to just build your application, use the APIs that will help that application gain traction, and at the same time save you money. But what happens when you want to switch APIs? You need to remove all of the dependencies, recode your application, then re-deploy it to your servers. And if you have an iOS application, you have to go through Apple’s cumbersome approval process.<p>Brightwork takes the pain out of APIs and removes that leap of faith. With Brightwork you can now turn up a stack in minutes, see all of your APIs’ performance and usage data information, and swap an API without the need to recode your application. We are unifying APIs to save Developers time and money. A lot of time. And a lot of money.<p>If you&#x27;re passionate about APIs we want to hear from you. We&#x27;re looking for someone that can come in and help with some technical heavy lifting. In exchange for your services you&#x27;ll get real world exposure to building an enterprise class platform for some of the biggest brands and companies.<p>Please note, this is an unpaid internship. Students who are enrolled in an accredited post primary school need only apply. Remote considered, but we would prefer candidates in the Portland, OR. area.
