Our BMI grants the brain a massively parallel channel to digital devices, enabling new, improved therapies for Parkinson&#x27;s and essential tremor, and serving as the data backbone to a new generation of neuroprostheses. The technology is based on parallel cables containing thousands of microwire electrodes that are splayed out on one end and inserted directly into the brain. At the opposite end, these wires are bonded to CMOS electronics using MEMs-based packaging techniques.<p>We are looking for someone with a background in process&#x2F;quality engineering who is interested in improving our microelectronic packaging process and process of constructing microwire bundle based probes. A background in MEMs technology, wafer polishing, and&#x2F;or microelectronic packaging (i.e. flip-chip) is desirable but not required. You should have a good mechanical and physical intuition and take pleasure in iterating on a design, taking it from &quot;good&quot; to &quot;robust.&quot;<p>You should be comfortable reading and working with mechanical drawings and have a basic understanding of analog circuits (Ohmâ€™s law, tau = RC).  Your regular duties will involve designing and building new mechanical apparatus, and using electronic equipment such as source measure units, data acquisition systems, and oscilloscopes. You will interact with scientists and design engineers, vetting concept-stage designs and integrating improved components and techniques into the process flow, while ensuring that the final products are robust and reliable.<p>Email us at hn@paradromics.com, we&#x27;ll be happy to hear from you.","time":1457137324,"type":"comment"}
