We are 12 people bringing the growth hacking tools that consumer Internet companies like Twitter&#x2F;Facebook build internally to other large-scale companies. We aim to build the best user growth engine on the planet. It&#x27;s crazy how messaging and email usage are changing, but the technology and capabilities haven&#x27;t caught up to the 21st century.<p>Our team of hackers and thinkers is from quant finance&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;Google, (we built large parts of Twitter&#x27;s growth systems). One of our top level goals is to build a uniquely fun and growth oriented company culture. Knowledge sharing in any capacity is highly valued here -- are you interested in prediction markets or PGP encryption? Do you enjoy teaching posture techniques or purely functional data structures to others? We pair program, design together, and generally create a learn-and-teach environment here. This is an opportunity to join a super-fast growing startup, in a huge market and with a great team, while it&#x27;s still early.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in coming on board, you can help with some challenges we face:<p><pre><code>    - Scale our messaging API\n    - Design and write performant, beautiful, asynchronous interfaces \n    - Write software to build machine learned user models \n    - Make data visualizations for our email and user data \n    - Design an immutable deployment infrastructure for our platform</code></pre>\nSome aspects of our culture that make us different:\n  - We are all very focused on self improvement\n  - Our company has egalitarian and transparent values (work when you want, on what you want)\n  - We are chill and empathetic people\n  - The company is completely transparent\nTechnologies you&#x27;ll work with:<p><pre><code>  - Scala\n  - Elasticsearch\n  - Postgres\n  - Redis\n  - AngularJS\n  - Play Framework\n  - RabbitMQ</code></pre>\nYou&#x27;ll get to work with us at our office at 5th and Market in San Francisco.
