Using our SW, platform and services, an employer can pay doctors directly, saving a ton of money and making the employee experience amazing (with the testimonials to back it up).<p>The company is well-funded, ~two years old and growing very rapidly with massive sales traction (300x this past year and on pace for another order of magnitude this year). We punch well above our weight-class with experienced founders, 150+ team members (~ one quarter is engineering), and paying customers.\nOur tech stack is a mix of Go and Java components with Angular on the front end. We use a custom service bus to tie our SOA together, microservices style. We love Docker, CoreOS, postgres, automated testing, and continuos integration.<p>As a company, we&#x27;re strong believers in transparency, trust and balance. As an engineering team, we believe good code is easy to read and should have a short &quot;time to understanding&quot;. We expect all of our engineers to continually teach as well as learn. We also believe that everyone should write good code, yet balance that against the need to ship.<p>We&#x27;ve got a ton of interesting problems to solve around distributed systems, data analytics and predictions, complex data modeling, ultra high-availability, security, privacy and more. We&#x27;re currently looking for experienced SW engineers up and down the stack, back end, infrastructure, data, dev ops, test, generalist, etc. Our biggest short term needs are AngularJS FE, SW Engineers in Test (you will be writing cluster level end2end tests, not unit tests), and Backend Engineers.<p>All open jobs: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;8f7q15\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;8f7q15</a><p>If you are non-technical, but are interested in experiencing a hyper-growth startup, we also are hiring for JIRA workflow automation, operations, business development and other roles as well. If you care about such things, we were recently flattered&#x2F;embarrassed to be highlighted as one of fifty potential next unicorns by the nytimes: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nyti.ms&#x2F;1JLKaCT\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nyti.ms&#x2F;1JLKaCT</a><p>We&#x27;re super proud of the company mission, engineering culture and tech stack we&#x27;ve put together and would love a chance to explain it all in detail!<p>*VISA minutiae: We can transfer H1B but can only sponsor them on a case by case basis. We can sponsor TN &amp; H1B1 visas in most cases. If you have another existing visa, we can probably transfer it.","time":1456849253,"type":"comment"}
