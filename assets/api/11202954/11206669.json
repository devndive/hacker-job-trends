Lots of Scala-based big data problems to hack on!  The realtime systems handle many 100s of thousands of QPS with mere millisecond latency.<p>How can you detect and remove anomalous data (from botnets perhaps) from datasets that are multiple petabytes in size?  Can you write a connected components algorithm that works efficiently at such a scale?  Can you write a model that detects individual behaviors within a cluster of device activity?<p>We run our own datacenters globally, are migrating systems over to Mesos (ooh, shiny), and infrastructure is a first-class critical project, not an afterthought.<p>All of this happens with a fairly small team of just over 30 engineers, all working together in NYC.<p>Come join us.<p>Email toby@tapad.com and say hi.","time":1456871623,"type":"comment"}
