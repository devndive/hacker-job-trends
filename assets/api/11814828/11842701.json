We allow people to live near their work, in very nice apartments, and not spend their whole paycheck on rent. Part of how we do this is by converting new luxury apartments.<p>We&#x27;re looking for an ambitious developer to help launch this early-stage venture, and work in the trenches with an experienced founding team. The founders have launched and run several companies before. Though we are bootstrapped, we&#x27;re processing over $1M &#x2F; year in annualized transaction volume. For the hungry individual, this is a crash course on how to found and launch a new venture.<p>At the heart of our service is the ability to introduce compatible housemates to one another, and do this automatically from our growing pool of people looking to move in. That&#x27;s where you come in; improving our automated matching system. Can you build a basic web service similar to a spreadsheet or trello? Great. Do you love APIs? Double great.<p>Skills: \nDocker, AWS, Datatables, Javascript, PHP, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, Rails.<p>Apply: tom@thehomeshare.com<p>HomeShare (www.thehomeshare.com) enables you to live in the heart of the city without breaking the bank.
