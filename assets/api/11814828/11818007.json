With rates averaging $300 &#x2F; hour, only 15% of Americans with serious legal problems even seek the help of a lawyer. For everyday issues like bogus cable bills, fewer than 1 in 1,000,000 of us seek justice, even though monopolists like Comcast rank in the 0th percentile for customer satisfaction. Class actions used to provide the necessary scale to combat certain widespread frauds, but over the past 5 years, the Supreme Court has allowed businesses to eliminate them.<p>The technical challenges are hard, ranging from automating the monitoring of corporate misconduct to crafting delightful user flows to building the leading database of outcomes in consumer disputes. In parallel with the software development, a team of Yale Law School alums conducts the deep research so that our users finally feel empowered, rather than intimidated, by the law.<p>We currently have a MVP (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.senddavid.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.senddavid.com</a>) and are looking for a Senior Engineer as a very early member of the team.<p>Position: Senior Engineer | Salary: $80足-$125k | Equity: 1.0%-足4.0% | <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;david-174&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;72943-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;david-174&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;72943-engineer</a><p>Contact us via Angel List or talent@senddavid.com","time":1464813979,"type":"comment"}
