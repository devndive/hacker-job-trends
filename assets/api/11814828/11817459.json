For example, many archaeologists may use the term “Bronze Age,” yet each may define the spatial and temporal extent of that period differently. During the first phase of the project (funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities) we collected over 3500 of these time period definitions and developed a tool for curating them. The Institute of Museum and Library Services is now funding the next phase, which will focus on tools for visualizing differences and patterns among period definitions.<p>We are hiring one part-time JavaScript developer who will help our two programmers (a PhD student and professor at the University of North Carolina) build interfaces that will allow our users to visualize, find, and curate relevant time periods for their work. This developer should have experience with React, d3, and modular JavaScript design. Familiarity with RDF would be beneficial. The time commitment is negotiable, although all work must be completed by May 2018 at the latest. All work will be remote. Email ryanshaw@unc.edu with a resume and short introduction if interested.","time":1464809728,"type":"comment"}
