We&#x27;re looking for devops or systems types to join our small devops team and help us go to the next level in automation and orchestration.<p>We&#x27;re also interested in speaking to engineers with more of a full-stack approach - the team is small and nimble and you can get exposure to frontend, data, Django, etc - all in one week!<p>Email jobs@arachnys.com with a link to your profiles (github etc) if you&#x27;re interested. A founder will read your application and respond within a few days at the latest.<p>Remote applicants who are able to be in one of our offices at least 1 day&#x2F;week may be considered - but you&#x27;d need to be willing to be onsite more at the start.","time":1464794383,"type":"comment"}
