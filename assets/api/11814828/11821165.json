The team is small so these job descriptions describe where your main focus will be, but you will be expected to pick up tasks &quot;from the other side&quot; now and then.<p>Experience with Linux and the command line is preferred.<p>Also, the main language in the office is Dutch and you will be expected to learn it if you do not already know it. Initially you can get by with English.<p>For both jobs you&#x27;ll have an interview with two developers where we&#x27;ll talk with you about past projects, technologies, programming languages, your interests, etc.  Then there will be a second interview with the local manager which fill focus more on the &#x27;soft&#x27; side of things, perhaps even salary.<p>If you make it through those two interviews you&#x27;ll have a short (hour long), on-site coding exercise just to see how you go about solving a problem. It&#x27;s a relatively simple exercise, you can ask questions, look stuff up on-line and it doesn&#x27;t have to be finished. It&#x27;s to give us a global impression on how you handle things.<p>1. Software Developer â€“ UI &#x2F; Javascript Applications<p>The main focus is the front-end.
