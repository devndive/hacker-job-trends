I believe there is opportunity to dramatically accelerate academic research. Instead of working in silos and hoarding information, we&#x27;d like scientists to work together openly over the Internet.<p>The core idea of Thinklab is to partner with science funders (e.g. The Gates Foundation or the NIH) and help them distribute their money in a way that creates incentives for scientists to work more openly and collaboratively. This is where you come in. I need a people person to build our community of scientists, and build partnerships with funders.<p>About me: I&#x27;ve sold two companies, and previously made a bunch of money through high frequency trading. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;jessespaulding\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;jessespaulding</a><p>I can offer you up to 40% equity.
