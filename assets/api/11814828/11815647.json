Most online learning has turned into &quot;let me throw up a bunch of videos and call it a course&quot;.  We help people actually learn and demonstrate their skills (we&#x27;re all self-taught).  Our paths take people from zero coding knowledge all the way through to getting jobs at companies like 3M and Fitbit.  Our cohesive curriculum, interactive learning by doing approach, project focus, and strong learning community are critical to this process.<p>We&#x27;re constantly trying new learning techniques and refining our approach.  We&#x27;re profitable and control our own destiny, so we have a lot of latitude to do what&#x27;s best for our students, not what&#x27;s best for VCs.<p>We&#x27;ve been teaching data analysis and data science to tens of thousands of students a month, but we want to expand into teaching data engineering.  Because we teach interactively, this both involves building backends (like Spark clusters), and teaching students how to use those backends in end-to-end data pipelines.<p>This position will have a lot of autonomy in creating and building a data engineering curriculum.  Nobody is teaching data engineering well online, and this is a great way to shape the future of the field.  If you&#x27;re passionate about building data infrastructure and teaching others to do the same, we&#x27;d love to chat.  We&#x27;d prefer strong knowledge in Python, Docker, and PostgreSQL at the minimum.<p>Email me at vik at dataquest.io if this sounds interesting!","time":1464797842,"type":"comment"}
