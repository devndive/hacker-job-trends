We’re on a mission to make world-class healthcare convenient and accessible to all of humanity. With Akira, Canadians can consult with physicians on-demand by secure text or video. They have mobile access to their health records, including labs, imaging, doctor’s notes, and prescriptions. Users have a Personal Health Assistant who will focus on preventing illness, rather than simply treating it. Based in Toronto, we’re building an interdisciplinary team of physicians, developers, data scientists and designers to tackle hard problems in healthcare technology. Our mobile health platform brings much-needed change to a medical system still reliant on fax machines and paper charts. We&#x27;ve also recently been featured on product hunt and the app store!<p>If you&#x27;re passionate about building a next-generation iOS or Android App and moving Canadian healthcare forward, email me at alex@akira.md or apply at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;akira.md&#x2F;about.html#careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;akira.md&#x2F;about.html#careers</a>","time":1464798764,"type":"comment"}
