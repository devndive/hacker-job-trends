Spring, Inc. is a mobile first retail startup, founded in 2013, with about $30M in funding to date. Our engineering team is growing and we&#x27;re looking for senior engineers who either just want to code all day or want to do some people leadership stuff along with coding. We&#x27;re using Golang as our server side language, with JS and React for web, Objective-C and Java (Android) for mobile.<p>Because Go is a relatively new programming language, you don&#x27;t need to know it to pass our interviews. (Although experience with OO is good.)<p>Spring&#x27;s engineering team is small, pragmatic, and excited to build products for our users. We&#x27;ve had a CI server set up from day one, so it&#x27;s easy for an engineer to get their code into prod and in front of end users.<p>Interested in applying? Take a look at our careers page (www.shopspring.com&#x2F;careers) and apply online. Our recruiting team reviews every single resume that comes in so you&#x27;ll get a response from us within about a week&#x27;s time.","time":1464798110,"type":"comment"}
