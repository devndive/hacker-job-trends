We&#x27;re a team of really smart people working in a very well funded startup trying to disrupt insurance in Italy by using technology as our main competitive advantage. We employ a micro service architecture (10s of them are in production atm), docker and AWS.\nMost of our micro services are written in Elixir, our language of choice for all the new stuff, we also have some Ruby and a bit of Python in production besides a legacy Symfony 2 application.\nOn the front end side we&#x27;re using React&#x2F;Redux.\nWe have a lot of automation in place, we run a pretty comprehensive test suite on CircleCI and BrowserStack at every push  and every developer can spin up QA environments that mirror our entire stack for a feature branch. All of this allows us to confidently deploy to production multiple times per day.\nIf you&#x27;re interested or just want some more info feel free to email me directly at andrea.usuelli@prima.it","time":1464813823,"type":"comment"}
