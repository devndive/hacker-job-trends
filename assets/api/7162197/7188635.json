We have laid legal groundwork (applied for 501c3 and have temporary fiscal sponsor), have considerable traction with fundraising, partner organizations (6 confirmed, 6 in the works), and a few initial pilot users.<p>We have one full-time co-founder and two part-time co-founders - none are technical. We are seeking a technical co-founder to lead our technical strategy (including but not limited to crowdfunding and social engagement), to take on projects (including but not limited to web development and CRM), and to to be a decision-making member of our core team. Web Development experience required.<p>The ideal candidate can contribute 8-10 hours per week, but would be able to go full time if we are admitted into a incubator program (we plan to apply to 3+ programs this year). No compensation is currently available, but is negotiable pending funding.<p>We are striving to create an organizational culture that values innovation, transparency, and integrity. We are a fun core group with a dynamic extended community of volunteers and supporters.<p>A passion for making the world a better place and engaging global issues is essential.<p>If interested, please email kerry@giveadayglobal.org, tell her billy sent you :)","time":1391658825,"type":"comment"}
