We make powerful design tools for Solar PV systems, making them very easy to use by leveraging a pretty sophisticated simulation engine (so we handle the physics for the user).<p>We&#x27;ve already launched our product[1], have some great traction (including a federal grant), and we&#x27;re still just a 2 man team, so there&#x27;s a lot of opportunity.  Everyday we get to deal with a range of problems that few startups get to offer – we have a pretty modern web-stack [2] (that we actually need, not just to be trendy), but also get to solve interesting physics&#x2F;optimization problems on a regular basis. It&#x27;s a really unique place in both the solar industry, and as a software company.<p>– Paul\npaul.gibbs@folsomlabs.com<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/better-faster-bankable-solar-pv-installation-designs-from-any-computer\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.greentechmedia.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;read&#x2F;better-faster-ba...</a>\n[2] AngularJS, Python&#x2F;Flask (API&#x2F;Backend), Cython&#x2F;C (Physics Simulation Engine)","time":1391280374,"type":"comment"}
