Alta Bicycle Share is the operator of bicycle sharing systems across the country and internationally including Citi Bike (NYC), Divvy (Chicago), Capital Bikeshare (Washington, DC), Hubway (Boston), Bay Area Bike Share (SF Bay Area), CoGo (Columbus, OH), Bike Chattanooga, and Melbourne Bike Share (Melbourne, AU) and we are looking for a senior web developer to work with our team building software that supports our operations across the country.<p>Our team handles two distinct pieces of bike share operations: the customer-facing sites for each of our cities (like www.citibikenyc.com) and internal tools that help our staff with their work in the day-to-day running of a bike share system (like our rebalancers, mechanics, dispatch, etc). Our technology stack is mostly PHP right now, though at least one of our internal APIs is written in Ruby, and I&#x27;d be open to arguments for moving languages &#x2F; stacks. Looking for a full-stack web developer, but really I&#x27;m just looking for someone who is excited about both software and bike share.<p>Apply at <a href=\"https://www.appone.com/MainInfoReq.asp?R_ID=796552\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appone.com&#x2F;MainInfoReq.asp?R_ID=796552</a>","time":1391457604,"type":"comment"}
