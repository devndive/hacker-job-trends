Wireless full-duplex allows a radio to transmit and receive signals at the same time using a single frequency channel. Kumu&#x27;s patent pending full-duplex technology changes the basic assumptions on which current wireless radios are built, allowing for improved performance and reduced complexity across a variety of wireless devices and markets.<p>We&#x27;re looking for well-rounded systems programmers with a strong embedded systems, C, Linux, and networking background. Fluency in Python and Git are big pluses. In addition, we&#x27;re looking for software engineers with a background in cellular stacks, and algorithms scientists with a background in optimization.
