We have developers all over the world and a 100% remote working environment.  Some of the development is open source (we are the primary contributors to Cassandra core, which is an Apache Foundation project...)<p>I just joined recently; as a senior developer with startup experience, I had lots of offers from various companies.  The reasons I chose DataStax were:<p>- 100% remote means I can work from whereever I want (I like to travel) and whenever, within reason, as long as I get my stuff done\n - the opportunity to work on interesting new technology that is rapidly changing and being adopted by a lot of Fortune 100, etc\n - they have been vocal about their plans to IPO in the next few years and are growing like crazy<p>Very competitive salary, lots of open positions: Java, Python, JS, I&#x27;ve even seen some Clojure.
