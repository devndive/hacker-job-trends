We&#x27;ve been around since 2005 as myYearbook, rebranding in 2012 as MeetMe.  We&#x27;ve launched other apps such as Choosy, Charm, and Unsaid in the past few months, and are looking to continue adding more standalone apps in the future.<p>We use a wide variety of languages, generally using what makes sense.  C, PHP, Python, JavaScript and Node.js, and native iOS and Android development are the most common.<p>MeetMe is a fun place to work.  We hold a yearly developer retreat, as well as regular company-wide hackathons.  We have a book club, board game club, and we even have a game room.  While we aren&#x27;t a new company in the time scale of the internet, we still know how to have fun.  We just get the benefit of not having to kill ourselves working 12 hour days. =)  This means you&#x27;ll enjoy actually going home on time!<p>Several Openings<p>* Senior iOS Architect<p>* Senior Android Architect<p>* Software Architect<p>* System Administrator<p>You can apply directly here: <a href=\"http://jobvite.com/m?3Je6egw2\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobvite.com&#x2F;m?3Je6egw2</a><p>Or you can contact me at jlotito@meetme.com","time":1391310601,"type":"comment"}
