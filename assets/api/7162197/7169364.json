With millions of users and an active consumer base across the US, we&#x27;re riding the proverbial rocketship with insane month-over-month growth figures. If you want to join a company that has ridiculous growth, opportunity, but also impact on the real world, Thumbtack might be a good choice.<p>Some things our users are saying: &quot;I owe my business to you&quot;, &quot;50% of my business is from Thumbtack&quot;, &quot;I can work less and earn more with Thumbtack.&quot; We help small businesses build their client-base. And on the flip side of the marketplace, we help consumers find just the right person to do the job with minimal effort on their part.<p>H1B is great. :-)<p>We&#x27;re a human-focused company: we brew beer, eat meals together (cooked by our in-house chef), and otherwise enjoy the usual startup perks in downtown SF. But we maintain a serious perspective about our software, engineering discipline, and experimental rigor.<p>If you&#x27;re in SF, I&#x27;m happy to meet up for coffee: email chris @.<p><a href=\"http://www.thumbtack.com/engineering\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thumbtack.com&#x2F;engineering</a>","time":1391413485,"type":"comment"}
