Most of the dev team is remote.<p>* H1B candidates are ok<p>* Interns welcome!<p>We are the team behind Mokriya Craigslist. Time, Wall Street Journal, Mashable, Xconomy, and a slew of tech bloggers raved about it. Check it out. <a href=\"http://craigslist.mokriya.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;craigslist.mokriya.com&#x2F;</a><p>We are a team of engineers, UX designers, and thinkers. We have worked for some of the hottest tech startups in Silicon Valley, including Path, MixPanel, Threadflip, SimpleGeo, SideCar, etc.<p>Google has us on a list of “best mobile development teams in the country” so we get calls from them too.<p><i>About You</i><p>You love to build. When you’re not at your job, you’re probably tinkering on some contraption in the basement or figuring out how to take apart &lt;insert-something-you-bought-recently&gt;. You get a thrill from figuring out a clever way to solve a problem. And you really take pride in knowing the ins and outs of Android. You should be familiar with the libraries so that you know the best ways to do things without re-inventing the wheel.<p><i>About How We Work</i><p>Every developer on the team is remote, so we just get stuff done, from wherever, and chat via HipChat&#x2F;GitHub to communicate. That, and the occasional G+ Hangout, is all we’ve found to be necessary.<p>Send a note to careers@mokriya.com (I&#x27;ll see it, I&#x27;m Adam. Sunil &amp; Pranil, the technical co-founders, will see it also). Say hi, tell us a bit about yourself. We&#x27;ll be most excited if you tell us about recent projects you&#x27;ve built, and technical details that you learned, or that interested you.","time":1391320894,"type":"comment"}
