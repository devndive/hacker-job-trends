Our customers are mostly students who have recently learnt programming. Our tool, Inck, helps such students write better programs. It&#x27;s design draws heavily from music. We&#x27;re looking for programmers that are also musicians whom we think will be able to really get behind our tools.<p>If you&#x27;re excited by this prospect, send me email at rohit@khitchdee.com","time":1391288834,"type":"comment"}
