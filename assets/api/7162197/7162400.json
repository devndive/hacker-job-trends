What kinds of things should we A&#x2F;B test? Should we implement an email capture? How can we update the checkout flow? Where are customers having difficulty when buying prescription eyewear on our websites? You would help decide what kinds of features to build, and then be responsible for implementing, testing, and iterating on new features. You should be proficient in HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS (framework-du-jour) and interested in using these skills to help our customers have a great experience.<p>This also applies to internal dashboards: we ship everything from our office, and have a lot of infrastructure to keep track of customers, order status, laboratory status, and shipments. How can we build more usable tools?<p>Our backend is Python (Flask) and MongoDB, including bits of Celery, nginx, and uwsgi. We do a lot of integration with the UPS (in fact, we maintain an open-source UPS library [1]). If you are interested in helping develop our eyewear API, please reach out too!<p>We develop white-label eyewear for other fashion brands; Classic Specs and Steven Alan are some of our brands.

If you build something cool that others would find useful, we want you to open-source it.","time":1391276429,"type":"comment"}
