It is a breathtaking science which is just now being discovered through the convergence of novel machine learning methods and the proliferation of inexpensive DNA sequencing. Our next step is a critical inflection point as we work to spread our technology through a beautiful consumer product and scale our scientific infrastructure to an unprecedented scale. If we succeed, we can drastically improve humanity&#x27;s fight against cancer through detection at an early, curable state. For this to work, we need great engineers at all levels of the stack who can take complete ownership of what they build.
