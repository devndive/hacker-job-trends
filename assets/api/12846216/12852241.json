You will be a manager with a team size of one - you. You will need to pick the next problem on the way to achieve our goals and solve it.  You will need to hold a lot of complexity in your head and have solid CS fundamentals. For what we do, Google may not have all the answers to your questions, github may not have any such sample code and Stackoverflow may have a vaguely related question with no replies, but you will be responsible for solving the problem.<p>We are currently looking for Computer Vision Engineers. Ideally a PhD in CV and&#x2F;or robotics. Just using thirdparty libraries (such as opencv) will not get you a job at Nod. You need to understand and possibly develop your own algorithms and optimize it. Implementing SLAM algorithms in memory and performance constrained devices will be a plus.<p>Team: ex-(Apple, Blackberry, Facebook, Google, Samsung). Approximately 1&#x2F;3rd of the team are PhDs (or PhDs on “pause”) in various fields (Math, Physics, CS) from MIT, Stanford, CMU etc.<p>Drop us an email at stdin@nod-labs.com","time":1478060598,"type":"comment"}
