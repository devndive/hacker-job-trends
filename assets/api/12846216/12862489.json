We&#x27;re a small (7 person) team building an extensible project management system that lets users create custom interfaces and build frontend plugins in javascript.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a 2nd technical cofounder to accellerate the development of our product, which is currently alpha-stage. You&#x27;d be working with me (the other technical cofounder) in designing and implementing the core backend as well the web frontend. We value our test-driven development, clear internal and external documentation, and doing things right rather than rushing things. Our stack is node.js and mongodb.<p>I&#x27;m happy to chat with you over the phone about what we&#x27;re doing. Email me at billy@tixit.me and mention you&#x27;re from HN, I&#x27;d love to hear what you&#x27;ve been working on.<p>More info: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;tixit-1&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;114395-technical-co-founder\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;tixit-1&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;114395-technical-co-founder</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tixit.me\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tixit.me</a> | Contact: billy@tixit.me | <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;tixit-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;tixit-1</a>","time":1478164340,"type":"comment"}
