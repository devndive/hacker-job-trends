EU-citizens or people with Swiss work-permit only.<p>What’s the deal?<p>Web software creation! As a member of our engineering team, you can get involved in brainstorming, architecture, development, testing, integration, delivery, operations, and project leadership. What you end up doing depends as much on you as on us. We want you to be free to develop your skills precisely where your passions lie.<p>What are our methods, languages, technologies, etc.?<p>You’re not going to find a lot of dogma here: we use agile and waterfall concepts as needed – no project is the same. We write in statically and dynamically typed as well as compiled and interpreted languages. We run quite a few databases (SQL or No), and don’t limit ourselves to a single framework. We do however strike a balance between the introduction rate of new tech vs. the need to maintain a stable and productive ecosystem. Here’s a couple of keywords to give you an idea of what we currently use: VanillaJS, AngularJS, React &#x2F; Flux (Alt), SCSS, Less, Apache, nginx, PHP, Java, Play Framework, Jetty, Clojure, Yada, Ring, SQL, Cassandra, MongoDB, TitanDB, Datomic, DynamoDB, Docker, AWS, CircleCI, Github, CQRS, DDD, Design Sprint.<p>Who are we looking for?<p>There is no ready-made mould we are waiting to cast you into. We’re open to fresh talent, seniors, as well as to gurus.<p>Mail us at:<p>info@deep-impact.tech","time":1478092296,"type":"comment"}
