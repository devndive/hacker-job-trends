We were founded in 2016 by an economist with experience at top hedge funds and the sell side (Jeff Young) and an expert in internet intelligence (Jim Cowie). Weâ€™ve raised a strong seed round and many of our investors are well known in macro finance.<p>Because our business is to gather and process activity from across the internet, we&#x27;re already handling a significant amount of data (and growing). Our key hires right now are people who can help us scale and manage this data infrastructure, or who can work with our economists to turn data signals into economically meaningful indicators.<p>More at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;deepmacro-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;deepmacro-1</a> or email srura@deepmacro.com.","time":1478025681,"type":"comment"}
