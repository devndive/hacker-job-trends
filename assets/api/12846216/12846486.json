We are Guardian Digital and we develop the website, the apps, and a variety of internal tools. We are looking for enthusiastic developers to join our web and iOS teams.<p>The Guardian is committed to a Digital First strategy; we love proactive developers who want to influence and inform our feature development and technology choices. Ideally, you will be accustomed to pairing and mentoring others.<p>We deploy continually and work in cross-functional teams (that include several developers alongside UX, Design and Product Managers). We mostly program in Scala and JavaScript, but will use the best tool that solves the problem.<p>The office is a 10 minute walk from Kingâ€™s Cross. Most of us work on Macs, however, some opt for other laptops, or Linux installation.<p>See who we are, or open an issue: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;guardian\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;guardian</a><p>More information on our interview process: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;info&#x2F;developer-blog&#x2F;2015&#x2F;jan&#x2F;20&#x2F;how-does-the-guardian-recruit-developers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;info&#x2F;developer-blog&#x2F;2015&#x2F;jan&#x2F;20&#x2F;...</a><p>If you are interested, drop me an email (kate.whalen@theguardian.com) with a bit of background on yourself, and any questions you have!","time":1478013732,"type":"comment"}
