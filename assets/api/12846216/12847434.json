Our idea is that an inner circle of trusted people, empowered with tools that enable them to be more effective and connected to the individualâ€™s needs is the best model for long term care. Our first focus is on issues related to mental health.<p>The full job specs are at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;circles.workable.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;circles.workable.com</a>, but in brief we&#x27;re looking for:<p>- A senior backend engineer to work on our (currently) Rails driven API system, along with the associated operations.<p>- A senior mobile engineer to work on our React Native front-ends, which also have native code components<p>- Less senior mobile engineers to work on the React Native&#x2F;native code front end systems.<p>As we&#x27;re small, everyone will probably do a bit of everything, including helping to build our &quot;prompting engine&quot;: a real time, privacy centric data analytics platform to give insights to your trusted circle members about your state.<p>We&#x27;re a new company, funded, and pretty tech agnostic. We don&#x27;t believe in below market salaries for startups, so you&#x27;ll be paid at market rate and still have options for equity. We&#x27;re also trying to create an environment in line with our product direction: a supportive group of peers trying to do good work without damaging ourselves or others. We do remote and on-site work, but can&#x27;t really support a totally remote employee, so you&#x27;ll need to be available in London a few times a week. Alas, we also can&#x27;t sponsor visas.<p>If anyone would like more information than the job specs provide, please just  ping me directly on adam@circles.care.","time":1478018089,"type":"comment"}
