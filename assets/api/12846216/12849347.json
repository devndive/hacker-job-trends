We&#x27;re a small, flat team of engineers building mission critical applications for Walmart. We work with our own tools and make our own build-or-borrow decisions. Our culture is a healthy mix of sharing and pushing each other to be better at our craft. We use pull requests &amp; code reviews liberally. We make refactoring time. We deploy often, with a single line of code run from a REPL. Engineers on our team are challenged to work through our full software stack and be part of our product management. We believe that people are more engaged, fulfilled and happy when they feel responsible for actually shipping their work.\nSome aspects of our work that are important to us:<p><pre><code>  - high performance distributed systems\n  - robust &amp; well-factored codebases\n  - simple &amp; fast deployments\n  - automating the hell out of operations\n  - thorough system test coverage\n  - managing our own development process and work backlog\n  - pair programming when it makes sense (locally and remotely)\n  - contributing back to the clojure &amp; open source community</code></pre>\nWhat we do:<p><pre><code>  - write all our production systems &amp; tools in Clojure\n  - create and orchestrate massive distributed systems\n  - spin up web services for handling large volumes of data</code></pre>\nFor a glimpse behind the scenes, check out a talk we gave at Clojure&#x2F;West. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=av9Xi6CNqq4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=av9Xi6CNqq4</a>.\nDoes this sound like something you&#x27;re into?
