See our demo of updating a drone in-flight at DockerCon [1]. We&#x27;re very emphatic about our remote culture [2].<p>The resin.io team is composed of people passionate about quality code, well-thought out architecture, and great user experience. Etcher.io, a tool we recently released, is a good example of all those things. Most of our code is node.js though we&#x27;re transitioning some parts of the stack to Go.<p>Some details on the individual roles:<p>Linux engineers - We&#x27;re building a minimal OS for embedded devices[3]. Knowledge of Yocto Linux very helpful.<p>Security engineers - Passionate about building an end-to-end secure code delivery pipeline, from the cloud to the device, all the way down to the bootloader and CPU?<p>Backend engineers - Resin&#x27;s backend is composed of ~10 node.js microservices, each with unique challenges.<p>UI&#x2F;Front-end engineers - We&#x27;re passionate about UX, and have a lot of cool features to build. Most of our UI is in AngularJS but knowledge of other frameworks a plus. \nWorkflow engineers - Looking for full-stack developers passionate about optimising the way a remote team works.<p>If this all sounds interesting, drop us a line at join@resin.io<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;75vm6rRb6K0?t=1569\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;75vm6rRb6K0?t=1569</a> [2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;resin.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-we-run-a-remote-team&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;resin.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-we-run-a-remote-team&#x2F;</a> [3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;resin-os&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;resin-os&#x2F;</a>","time":1478062648,"type":"comment"}
