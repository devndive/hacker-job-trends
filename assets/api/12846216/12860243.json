Discord is kind of like Skype &#x2F; Slack except it has a lot less of the CPU grinding code that messes up your framerate, even when you’re in a team with 40,000 other people. We are well funded (greylock+benchmark!) and growing incredibly fast.<p>It turns out growing this fast means there&#x27;s a giant pile of work sitting in the middle of the room. Stuff gets thrown on top faster than we can take it off. And the pile stinks.<p>So we&#x27;re hiring for these roles below:<p>- Sr. App Developer<p>- Sr. Server Engineer<p>- Sr. Android Developer<p>- Sr. Data Engineer<p>- Full-Stack Engineer<p>- Sales Engineer<p>- Marketing Associate&#x2F;Partnerships<p>- Marketing Associate&#x2F;Community &amp; Events<p>- Staff Accountant<p>More: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discordapp.com&#x2F;company#join\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discordapp.com&#x2F;company#join</a><p>If you don’t see a role but are interested anyway - just send me a message, as I’m sure we will be hiring for All The Things™ soon enough.<p>Our stack runs primarily on GCP (and some AWS) and includes JS&#x2F;React&#x2F;Flux, Elixir&#x2F;Erlang, Python, Cassandra, Redshift and Redis with a few others like C++ mixed in as needed.<p>If you love games and want to work with a passionate team - let me know: sergei [at] discordapp [dot] com | If you really must, there’s also plain vanilla jobs@discordapp.com … it goes to my Discord anyway.","time":1478128388,"type":"comment"}
