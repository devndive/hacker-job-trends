We have a small but strong core team, and are looking to add more talented engineers who want to build the next generation online fashion shopping experience.  We view ourselves as an Internet product + technology company that happens to do fashion, and our team and strategy reflect that.  Our stack is Ruby on Rails and Postgres, but we don't require previous RoR experience (none of us had it when we started, so that wouldn't be fair, now would it?).<p>If you are interested in solving interesting tech problems in a fun space with great visibility, then get in touch with me at anthony@tobi.com.  Thanks HN!","time":1296603695,"type":"comment"}
