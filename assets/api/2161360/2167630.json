Full-time job with benefits, we pay well, and you get to work on startup-y projects (ie. agile, small teams, etc.) You get lots of freedom, ownership (projects are starting from scratch, no legacy projects here) and little corporate crap.<p>Specifically looking for:<p>- Javascript person: you should be really good at javascript, jquery etc. You'll be writing from scratch a gmail-like browser app (simpler though), using something like Sammy js, accessing data from a json backend api. When applying, show me something you've done in this spirit.<p>- Windows, Mac developers. You'll write a Dropbox-like app that runs on Windows and/or Mac. (It's pretty different from Dropbox but that's the closest I found.) Make sure it doesn't crash or slow down the computer. Make it Just Work. Show me something you've done when applying.<p>You must be located in Montreal. Contact info in my account info.","time":1296597763,"type":"comment"}
