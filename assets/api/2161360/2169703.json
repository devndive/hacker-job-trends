So, we need great people!<p>We're looking for great developers (and many other roles too) to work on a variety of exciting online projects. We use Clojure, Ruby, Hadoop, Node.js, Sinatra etc.<p>Above all we're looking for smart, ambitious, entrepreneurial people. Full job spec is here: <a href=\"http://www.forward.co.uk/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.forward.co.uk/careers</a> or here: <a href=\"http://www.forwardtechnology.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.forwardtechnology.co.uk/</a><p>And it's fun to work here: you choose the hardware you want, you buy the books you need, the hours are flexible, no dress code, free classes (language, music and even poker), the people are reasonable and the entertainment budget is generous: for example the entire company hangs out in Las Vegas night clubs and casinos for 4 days every December and we've recently returned from Disneyland in Paris (birthday celebrations).<p>To find out more email me at evgeny.shadchnev@forward.co.uk with your CV.<p>p.s. sorry, all our devs are on-site, we don't hire remote devs. Also, given the recent changes to the immigration laws in the UK, it will be very challenging (maybe even impossible) for us to arrange a visa unless you're an EU national or already have a work permit.","time":1296640647,"type":"comment"}
