We have extremely flexible hours, collaborative coder DNA, good tools, a strong team to work with, and great health care.<p>Pikimal is working to change how people use the web to make decisions. Once users tell us what's important to them, we can tell them what's best for them. Since all of our recommendations are based solely on facts, users receive results separate from marketing.<p>Please include a link to public code you've written or your Github repo when you apply.
