We're well funded and have a lot of big clients including some household names. Our primary office is in NYC but working in our satellite offices (Dublin, Barcelona, Manila) or remotely would be fine too.<p>We run everything on Linux, we run both virtualised and bare metal environments. We need someone with experience in multi tier network environments (IPS, IDS etc), general network maintenance and support. We're on a big push to automate things we should have a long time ago, so strong scripting skills are a huge plus, as is experience with using Nagios for monitoring. Our software stack is Java so JVM performance tuning and analysis is also desirable. We have lots of interesting problems.<p>Mail me directly for more details or with questions, colin@&#60;company&#62;.com","time":1328105420,"type":"comment"}
