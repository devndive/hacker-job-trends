We’re working on a web/email app that makes it easier to write documents with other people. It automatically keeps track of what changed and who did the work, without requiring people to modify how they currently do things, whether it be by passing attachments around by email or by sharing documents in dropbox. It’s not launched yet.<p>Design is really important to us and you’ll be our first dedicated designer. (Right now our team is approximately 4 developers and a business guy.) We’re running into lots of design challenges and need someone to take the lead on these, in addition to designing the overall experience. As an example, this week we are thinking about how to show the changes between two Word documents in a clearer way than the Word compare view (which is horrible!).<p>We dream of hiring a junior version of Ryan Singer. We want someone who’s quite analytical about the design process. Regarding technical stuff, you need to be able to work in HTML and CSS, have a good understanding of what’s possible to do with Javascript, and know or be willing to learn git.<p>Get in touch with me (ben@contextualsystems.com) with any questions, or send a CV and link to your portfolio to apply. I’ll put a more detailed job ad up at <a href=\"http://contextualsystems.com/jobs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://contextualsystems.com/jobs/</a> soon.","time":1328111556,"type":"comment"}
