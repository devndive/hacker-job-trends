We are a team of outstanding teachers, scientists, engineers and business professionals who come together every day to create science education resources that kids actually want to engage with.<p>We’re looking for another backend engineer to join our team, building features our users will love and scaling the product to meet the demand from our rapidly growing user base. You’ll work mainly on our service-oriented Ruby applications running on AWS, as well as on the full tech stack that supports them.<p>You either have a CS&#x2F;engineering degree, or you&#x27;ve taught yourself the bits that matter. You might have worked with some databases before and learned your B-trees from your hash tables and what a row-level lock is. You&#x27;ve not only built a few CRUD APIs, but you&#x27;ve probably also untangled a few race conditions, and you now think through failure states and idempotency whenever you write new code.<p>You&#x27;ll end up working with Ruby, MySQL, MongoDB, Docker (we use it for just about everything), AWS, Protocol Buffers, Prometheus (we’re big on monitoring our app and keeping ahead of problems!), and whatever tools you choose to solve the problem at hand. Haven&#x27;t used many of these before? That&#x27;s fine; this is a great opportunity to learn!<p>Find out more about the position at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stileeducation.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;backend-software-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stileeducation.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;backend-software-engineer</a>","time":1546474564,"type":"comment"}
