Our underlying distributed key-value layer, TiKV, is a CNCF project.<p>We have a lot of interesting challenges to keep scaling for our existing users with 100+ TB of data and expanding to help users in new ways with their database needs.<p>I am part of the international team based out of San Mateo (bay area). Our small team is oriented to being remote, and we travel periodically to meet in person. Much of our team effort is targeted towards making this amazing technology more accessible to the rest of the world [1].<p>Our tech stack is Rust, Go, Kubernetes, and TiDB itself! You can work on a serverless cloud service, do low-level database hacking, or work directly with customers depending on your existing experience.<p>I like working on TiDB because I get to be a part of a big change going on in databases and work with a highly-skilled cohesive team. I am constantly learning new things about databases, Kubernetes, etc, but I also get to apply my existing experience to have a big impact.<p>See the jobs link for more details and compensation.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;11&#x2F;tidb-developer-pingcap-wants-to-expand-in-north-america-after-raising-50m-series-c&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;11&#x2F;tidb-developer-pingcap-wan...</a>","time":1546452057,"type":"comment"}
