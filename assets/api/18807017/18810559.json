We&#x27;re looking for people to help improve our capabilities in performing stealthy, highly targeted attacks against our clients. We want someone who doesn&#x27;t blanch when it comes to using certutil to reconstruct a base64 encoded payload on a Windows server because the upload capacity was too limited to upload the full payload. Someone who is willing to write a perl script to forward ports on a GNU&#x2F;Linux server to pivot into a privileged network. If that and writing custom web-shells and creating custom attacks for specific client profiles interest you, this is the role for you.<p>SRA is a 120+ person security firm focused on improving security holistically, from doing red team engagements to building a security strategy and everything in between for Financial Services, Healthcare, Pharmaceutical, Technology, Industrial and Consumer Products industries.
