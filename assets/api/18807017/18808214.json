Replacing textbooks with tablets won’t be enough. We believe schools need a new foundation. That’s why we’re building a web-based school scheduling platform, that allows administrators to put master schedules and daily calendars into a single cloud-based system. We are creating the next generation of software for all K12 schools to fundamentally change how they design, measure and improve their schools. We are also a company that deeply values diversity in every way.<p>View openings, including sales, engineering, customer success, and design on our site: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ablschools.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ablschools.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a><p>--------------------------------------------------<p>Personal note: I&#x27;ve been on the Abl engineering team for over a year and I love it.
