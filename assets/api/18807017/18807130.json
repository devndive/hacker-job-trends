All of this allows us to confidently deploy to production multiple times per day.<p>Our stack:<p><pre><code>  AWS (a lot of services), CloudFlare\n  OS: Amazon Linux\n  EC2 instance number: from ~30 to ~100: we scale automatically a lot of times during the day and treat our infrastructure as immutable\n  Infrastructure: CloudFormation + scripts\n  CD: Drone CI, Docker (dev -&gt; qa -&gt; staging -&gt; production)\n  Container orchestration: AWS ECS\n  DB: Aurora MySQL and PostgreSQL, Redshift, ElastiCache Redis, DynamoDB\n  Monitoring: ELK, DataDog, New Relic, CloudWatch\n  Team organization: small cross functional agile teams (every team has at least one person for all of these roles: backend engineer, frontend engineer, web designer, qa engineer, devops engineer)\n  Backend languages: Elixir, PHP (we&#x27;re phasing it out long term), Haskell, Python, Rust, Ruby\n  Frontend languages: Elm, Javascript\n</code></pre>\nIf you&#x27;re interested or just want some more info feel free to email me directly at andrea.usuelli@prima.it","time":1546445446,"type":"comment"}
