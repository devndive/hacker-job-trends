We&#x27;re making orthodontics cheaper, faster, and more accessible for everyone, plus we&#x27;re backed by the same investors as Warby, Instacart, Casper and GoodRx. Read about us in TechCrunch.<p>## The Role<p>Our graphics engineers build our treatment planning environment — from the ground up.  You’ll work hand in hand with our world-class UCSF-trained orthodontists to create a groundbreaking 3D environment for treatment planning.<p>We have several in-house algorithms for working with 3D models, and now we need to build a UI for working with them.<p>You’ll be responsible for building a native application that loads 3D models from intra-oral scans and allows doctors to manipulate teeth in an intuitive, novel interface.  This software directly empowers our doctors to deliver better treatment plans and work faster.<p>## Responsibilities:<p>• Imports meshes from our segmentation algorithms<p>• Develop 3D UI for displaying STL files&#x2F;3D meshes<p>• Manipulation tools: rotation, translation, smoothing, extrusion etc<p>• Visualization of meshes eg. collision detection<p>• Interpolation of translation&#x2F;rotation between keyframes<p>• Exporting meshes to our API<p>## Contact<p>Reach out to tony[at]uniformteeth[dot]com for more info!  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2RwmMlK\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2RwmMlK</a>","time":1546474582,"type":"comment"}
