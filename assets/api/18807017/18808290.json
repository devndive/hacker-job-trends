Or at least improve a small part of it.<p>Bagel is a new electronic health record for the growing number of doctors that don&#x27;t accept insurance, particularly direct primary care (DPC) docs. DPC is trying to cut insurance out of primary care. It makes no sense to use insurance to pay for basic or routine medical services; do you use your car insurance to pay for an oil change? There are some seriously great knock-on benefits of getting rid of insurance too. Here&#x27;s a good rundown: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;srconstantin.wordpress.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;25&#x2F;direct-primary-care&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;srconstantin.wordpress.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;25&#x2F;direct-primary...</a><p>We&#x27;re still in the early design phase, and we&#x27;ll be starting implementation soon. We&#x27;ll hit the ground running; I&#x27;d like to get a usable version out within three months.<p>Here&#x27;s the tentative stack: Typescript, React, Apollo Client, backend on Google Cloud (App Engine, probably), GraphQL, Postgres (+ Sequelize or similar). Ideally you&#x27;d be awesome at a few of these and competent in the rest.<p>I&#x27;m Colin McDonnell, MIT EECS 2016, the sole founder of Bagel, and all-around nice person. If you&#x27;re interested in working together, email me at colin(at)bagel(dot)md with a resume and a bit about you and why you&#x27;re interested! Cheers.","time":1546451754,"type":"comment"}
