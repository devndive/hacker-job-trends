We&#x27;re taking on the work management space and I have a fundamental belief that technology can help us all self-organize more efficiently and in return allow us to work more in our genius, achieving a state of flow more often. Asana delivers on this with our product and our culture.<p>We&#x27;re looking for Engineers who are passionate about creating a phenomenal culture that enables autonomy and responsibility while striving to building the best product possible because that&#x27;s what we compete on.<p>Our tech stack: Typescript &#x2F; React and our own version of GraphQL (we built it before GraphQL was open sourced). Our version of GraphQL executes all queries as &quot;live&quot; by default. This means you do not need to worry about data changes when designing a feature.<p>I joined because I was convinced that the incredible collaboration experiences I had in a small startup could be scaled up to big companies.
