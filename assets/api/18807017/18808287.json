Handshake is the leading platform helping close the opportunity gap for recent college graduates. Last month we closed 40 Million in Series C funding!<p>In the past you needed to live close to a big economic hub, or have well connected parents to land a good job after graduating from college. We are changing that to make employment more democratic. Super great culture, everyone here is mission driven, and passionate about making life easier for those in, and graduating from college.<p>We are really passionate about making sure our stack is mature and battle-tested to best serve the nine million students on Handshake. Our backend is Rails and Postgres, where on the frontend you will find React and TypeScript. Some Elasticsearch thrown in there for search. We also use Spark &amp; Databricks for data stuff. Happy to provide more info&#x2F;context!<p>We have _lots_ of open positions right now. Drop me a note (email in profile) or apply online if anything sounds exciting!","time":1546451742,"type":"comment"}
