We have the ability to digitize sound cleanly through sound-proofing and high quality signal paths. We need the ability to process the digitized sound to recognize the soundscape. At the same time, we need the ability to augment the soundscape with synthesized soundstreams that will play out the speakers in our recording room.<p>We are currently producing a piece of music titled \"Fat lie kebab -- it's a big fat lie\" to commemorate the Kumbh Mela that is in progress, here at Allahabad. If you're planning to attend the mela, it's a great time to check us out. We're holding an open house during this time. See <a href=\"http://khitchdee.forumatic.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&#38;t=21\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://khitchdee.forumatic.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&#38;t=21</a><p>We expect you to write code and jam with us over obscure musical rhythms so you should be into the music. We can help you understand the algorithms if you're not familiar with DSP, but you have to pick up the programming. It's initially in C on Windows.<p>For a full time position, we can offer up to 7 lakhs p.a. + a small amount of equity. Part-time positions and internships are also available.<p>Allahabad is a great place to be working on music.","time":1359749657,"type":"comment"}
