We're building it in-house from scratch to be an API-driven JS MVC (Ember) application for cross-platform deployment.<p>This is where you come in: we're looking for a few developers who want to be a part of building something right the first time. The team building this is currently just me and two other people and we will be building everything forward of API consumption (UI dev, testing, &#38; deployment across any imaginable platform). We'll be working with PhoneGap, Swagger, HTML/Handlebars, CSS/Compass/SCSS, JS, Ember, PhoneGap, Chef, Selenium, Mixpanel, Optimizely, and/or whatever other tools are right for the job (little is set in stone, we're in the prototype phase of the project). There are lots of jobs in other segments as well.<p>If you're interested, get in touch! nathan.hammond@ally.com","time":1359729765,"type":"comment"}
