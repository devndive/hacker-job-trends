Someone to keep things running smoothly, from troubleshooting OS X to just keeping the cables in the conference rooms connected up right. If you have to stop yourself from fixing computers when you're wandering around in public you're our kind of person. If you enjoy people too and love making tech work for humans, I want to talk to you.<p>This was originally my job. I hired someone to take over for me and got promoted. That guy just got promoted. Now we need someone new. This is the kind of place where you pick a thing and become the dude for that. We're growing about 40% per year, lotsa room to move around.<p>Just out of college? Dropped out of college? That's cool. If you can make computers work for people, that's what counts.<p>Contact me if you wanna know more: reedhn@pivotallabs.com<p>Full (kinda dull) job listing here:\n<a href=\"http://pivotallabs.com/pl_job/it-support-engineer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pivotallabs.com/pl_job/it-support-engineer/</a><p>And of course, we're always hiring ruby and moblie devs:\n<a href=\"http://pivotallabs.com/pl_job/software-engineer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pivotallabs.com/pl_job/software-engineer/</a>","time":1359759032,"type":"comment"}
