We're looking to do a complete overhaul of our backend infrastructure, and this is your opportunity to design and implement a system the way you know best.<p>Also, we're always looking for talented Ruby developers. Most of our application runs on Rails, but a solid foundation in non-Rails Ruby is highly desired. Familiarity with securityÂ in general, Rails' security guidelines in particular, and writing polished, tested code are high on our list of desired traits.<p>Email me directly at `stephen.touset@onelogin.com` if you're interested in applying.
