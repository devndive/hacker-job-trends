We work with early-stage startups to help refine their idea, whittle it down to an MVP, and then we build that. We try to do that quickly and efficiently, because then, the real work starts; and we are there for the startup to support, guide, and iterate.<p>We love open source and working with startups. We're primarily Ruby (Sinatra, Rails, EventMachine), JavaScript (front-end and back-end), and HTML5, and more recently native development.<p>We're currently looking to bring another great developer into the team.<p>Our old site is pretty outdated and under active re-design/development, so check out our not-yet-launched new site: <a href=\"http://new.alfajango.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://new.alfajango.com</a><p>We also have an open-source site for our OSS projects: <a href=\"http://opensource.alfajango.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://opensource.alfajango.com</a>","time":1359731944,"type":"comment"}
