Our product lets teams offer unused or unsold seats as in venue upgrades through a mobile device,  providing an awesome experience for the fan.  It's better for fans, better for teams, and both love our current product. We are a well-funded and passionate startup, looking for a few devs to help us grow and change the industry.<p>Some technologies we use: Groovy/Grails, PostgreSql, redis, BackboneJS, etc. Experience with any of these is not required.
