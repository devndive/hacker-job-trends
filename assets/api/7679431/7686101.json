We&#x27;re interested in your medical data, your genetic data and other biological data we can get about you. We use it to provide clinical decision support to prescribers as they prescribe, not two days after when the patient is complaining about the side effects.<p>We have a (pretty much) full javascript stack for our web app. Node and MySQL db on the back, single page, responsive, Angular on the front. We&#x27;re into beautiful UI and intuitive UX. If this sounds like your kind of thing get in touch. Salary is good, vested share equity included, offices are shared with other cool startups (Wayra accelerator), flexible about hours and location.<p>Contact: adam@geneix.com @Adam_HC","time":1399043189,"type":"comment"}
