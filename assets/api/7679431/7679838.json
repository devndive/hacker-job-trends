We do all the hard, annoying stuff, so founders can get back to running their businesses.  We were founded by former Etsy, Amazon and Worldpay executives, who have had successful exits in the past.<p><a href=\"http://www.justworks.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justworks.com</a><p>Justworks is looking for a full stack engineer with a focus on backend, processing, distributed systems, ops etc.  This is similar to a Devops position.  We move money around, so this is for someone who is comfortable with doing fairly serious engineering.  You should be comfortable with basic tasks like running a migration and editing a small amount of business logic, but more importantly things like upgrading our boxes when stuff like Heartbleed comes out, building and maintaining monitoring infrastructure (we currently use Nagios and StatsD&#x2F;Graphite) etc.<p>Justworks is an awesome place to work (please feel free to ask me any questions, here or contact info in profile).  We&#x27;re very early (only 9 employees, 3 eng) and we&#x27;re really looking for someone who wants to have a large amount of ownership, is opinionated and excited to help build a strong culture, and loves what they do.  Here is a link to the position.<p><a href=\"http://boards.greenhouse.io/justworks/jobs/12485#.U2JV561dW8s\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;justworks&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;12485#.U2JV561dW8...</a>","time":1398953691,"type":"comment"}
