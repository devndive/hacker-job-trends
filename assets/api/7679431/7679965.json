We&#x27;re doing great things in PA and NY with our pilot school districts, showing how you can use machine learning and natural language processing to help give automated tutoring support outside of standardized testing and high-stakes assessment.<p>We&#x27;re currently a team of 11, mostly in Pittsburgh (with one remote employee), and our founders have a mixture of Ph.D. machine learning and entrepreneurial experience. We&#x27;re well-funded and more-or-less bootstrapped, through grants from the Gates Foundation as well as a number of corporate and institutional customers.<p>We&#x27;re hiring an experienced web developer for a full-time position building front-end applications powered by our machine learning backend. The platform will aim to help teachers assess student work, such as essays or journals, and improve student writing through feedback during the revision and editing process.<p>You’ll be working primarily in AngularJS on a rich single-page application. Our web services are built in Python using the Django framework, and our backend is powered by state-of-the-art machine learning implemented in Java. Your primary responsibilities will focus on frontend development, but you’ll occasionally dive into our Python web services and collaborate on defining our user workflows including UX and visual design. There&#x27;ll be many opportunities to learn a lot about NLP, AI, and machine learning, if you&#x27;re interested.<p>We prefer an on-site employee at our office in Pittsburgh, PA, but can make exceptions for awesome people. Compensation is  competitive and based on experience.","time":1398954892,"type":"comment"}
