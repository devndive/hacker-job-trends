We’ve built PressureNet, our open platform for crowdsourcing weather data. Our system currently takes in almost 1M atmospheric pressure measurements per day, and your job is to help grow that to 10M &#x2F; day and then 100M &#x2F; day. This data is extremely valuable in producing very high resolution (1-4km) weather forecasts, and potentially will lead a revolution in how we understand our atmosphere.<p>We currently have a single Android app to collect data and engage users. We&#x27;re in the planning stages of building new, more innovative and user-friendly weather apps and SDKs on both Android and iOS. You’ll build our apps and SDKs, which means you&#x27;ll write code to collect sensor data, visualize weather patterns, and innovate on how weather forecasts are delivered.<p>Compensation: Equity TBD.
