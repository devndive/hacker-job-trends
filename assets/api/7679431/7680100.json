We use agile development, git, maven.<p>Reasons to like SPINS:<p>- We are sort of an established startup. About 100 people, so you have resources, a good team, and security. But friendly, casual, flexible on hours and which office you work from, free snacks, biweekly masseuse, that sort of thing.<p>- We are at the intersection of two huge growth industries: big data analysis and natural foods&#x2F;products.<p>- We are spinning up some cool projects using cool tech: Hadoop big data processing, new webapps, and mobile later this year.<p>You can see some job postings at <a href=\"http://spins.atsondemand.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;spins.atsondemand.com&#x2F;</a> but a lot of them haven&#x27;t gone up yet, so feel free to ping me at snoto@spins.com for the lowdown if you&#x27;re interested in any engineering role.","time":1398955936,"type":"comment"}
