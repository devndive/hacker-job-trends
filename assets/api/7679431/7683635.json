Work on something with actual scale.  Mostly LAMP backends, but we love the right tool for the job.  We&#x27;re looking for a mobile dev with some Android &amp; iOS experience.  You&#x27;ll do mobile development for various education &amp; mobile apps, rock that code review, and enjoy what you&#x27;re doing (we don&#x27;t hire people who don&#x27;t).  Because we get a crazy amount of web traffic, we can direct a lot to our mobile apps and make awesome new ideas blow up overnight.<p>Please mention HN, an app you&#x27;ve developed, and the largest team you&#x27;ve worked with.  Your email will go straight to the Director of Technology (me) and skip the HR folks.","time":1398993245,"type":"comment"}
