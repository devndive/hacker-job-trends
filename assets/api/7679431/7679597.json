Most of the information on the Internet about people is self-generated content. Facebook has self-generated content about your personal life. LinkedIn has self-generated content about your professional life. When it comes to people, there&#x27;s very little reputation info on the Internet. LinkedIn endorsements are a step in the right direction, but they only cover professional topics and many people don&#x27;t find them useful. We are building the next generation reputation engine that validates a person&#x27;s best qualities in a way that is reliable, useful, and fun. Everyone has qualities that they&#x27;re proud of. We will help people build reputation from those qualities and get the most of out of their best reputation.<p>Be on the ground floor of a new company being incubated and launched out of Flagship Ventures.
