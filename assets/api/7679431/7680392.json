Clever (<a href=\"https://getclever.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getclever.com</a>) is building the data platform needed for great software to make its way into the classroom. Just like Stripe has made it simple for developers to build payment processing into their apps, Clever has made it easy for developers to build applications for schools using student data.<p>We&#x27;re a small team of highly technical hackers with deep experience in education. Since releasing the Clever APIs in 2012, we&#x27;ve signed up the most innovative education companies as partners and deployed our platform to 1 in every 7 schools in America. Clever is making it easier for 4M students to use technology in the classroom, and that number is growing rapidly.<p>We have all the usual SF startup perks: a beautiful loft office in SoMa, free lunch, and great benefits.  More importantly, you’ll be working around a team of 24 smart, talented people (9 engineers) who are all equally committed to solving this particular problem.<p>We’re always pushing each other to learn new things, both technical and nontechnical - in the past few weeks we’ve done collaborative tech talks on things like:<p>-exoplanets<p>-kitesurfing<p>-Magic: the Gathering<p>-Regular Expressions for Regular People<p>(We also play a lot of bughouse chess.)<p>We’re looking for full-stack engineers who can hack in Node, Go, and Python (or are willing to learn), but more importantly, we’re looking for people who share our passion for improving education.  Come help us change the classroom: <a href=\"https://clever.com/about/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs</a>","time":1398958510,"type":"comment"}
