Our systems are written on the LAMP stack and deployed on Amazon Web Services using Puppet and Capistrano; we are migrating to Symfony 2 as our MVC framework. Developers choose the tools that work best for them - for instance, at the moment we have a mix of Linux and Mac workstations in the team. We are adopting and adapting agile development techniques such as evolutionary design, pair programming, and continuous deployment. We hold regular retrospectives to improve our working environment and lightning talks to share what we learnt. Our developers are generalizing specialists; a typical day may include refining an algorithm, writing a tricky integration test, tuning an SQL query, and discussing feature nuances with a product manager. Our team is growing fast and we&#x27;d like to hear (at careers@secretsales.com) from any of you who&#x27;d like to join us; we&#x27;re hiring for all technical roles, especially developers of all levels of experience.<p>Established in London in July 2007, Secretsales.com is the UK&#x27;s leading private shopping club, offering limited-time online sales with current name-brand goods at deep discounts.
