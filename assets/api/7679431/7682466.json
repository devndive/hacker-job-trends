We also help companies get acquired by matching them with acquirers who want their skills and products.<p>We&#x27;re opening our beta tomorrow(!) and we&#x27;re moving fast -- there&#x27;s a lot of potential for impact and real serious contribution. So fast we don&#x27;t have a &#x2F;jobs page yet. :)<p>Data Engineer<p>Looking for engineers with solid Python experience to work on one or more of: data API integrations, data modelling, machine learning and classification, NLP, API design, visualisations.
