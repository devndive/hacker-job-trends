You should know a few things about us before we begin.<p>1. We're a small tight-knit team that wants to change how rentals are done. The rental industry is old, antiquated, and ready for a push. We think we have the right recipe, and so does Balderton Capital, who invested in us for our Series A.<p>2. We don't do deadlines, or assign your day to day work to you, or tell you how to get it done, or make your decisions. You're smart, professional. You already know how to build software so you don't need us to tell you. Of course, we don't mind helping if you get stuck.
