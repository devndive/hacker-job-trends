Weâ€™re in search of back-end developers with a passion for solving hard problems with performant code. If you are interested in creating great products, building new features and improving the existing Shopify features, then please apply!<p>Developing Shopify<p>Shopify is the longest continuously developed Rails app on the planet and we care a great deal about code quality. Shopify, in contrast to most other rails shops, always runs on the latest rails version. Many core rails features have been developed within Shopify and have later been added to the Rails framework. We often go back and improve core parts of the Shopify codebase to make it better or more lean. We can do this because we have a positively massive unit test coverage which will immediately sound the alarm when something goes wrong.<p>We ship on quality instead of on time. When a feature is ready we deploy it immediately to everyone or use an internal system to roll it out to a certain percentage of customers. Various teams deploy new code many times throughout the day.<p>Shopify's production scale is massive.
