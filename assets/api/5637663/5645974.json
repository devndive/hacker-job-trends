{"by":"eqdw","id":5645974,"parent":5637663,"text":"I'm a RoR developer working at a company in the Bay Area called Coupa Software. We're a provider of e-procurement software, which is enterprisey stuff that helps large companies manage their internal spending. Tech reporters often describe us as \"Mint.com for businesses\" but that's only a small part of what we do.<p>We generally target lots of very enterprisey customers, but we're still pretty small and not-corporate. At the moment the dev team (including PMs, UX, etc) is about 20 people. I like to think we're at a pretty good balance between startup and big company.<p>We're currently hiring \"Ruby on Rails Developer, Integrations Engineer, Front End Developer, UX Designer, Visual Designer\", but imho we're mostly in need of full stack devs. This company is growing very very very quickly, and flexible developers who can wear many hats are the best for that<p>We're in downtown San Mateo, 1 block from Caltrain. REMOTES, H1Bs, TNs (I am one! from Canada eh?) are all ok. Competitive pay, 401k, health insurance. WFH privileges, flex time, all that good stuff. An unlimited PTO system.  And as a personal anecdote: I've experienced almost no overtime here, and virtually no pressure to overwork myself. Coupa respects a healthy work-life balance.  There's a lot of room for self-management here; work the way you work best, show results, and you'll be given the freedom to do it however you like.<p>If anyone is interested, mail me at tim.herd @ coupa.com, paste your resume, github link, maybe a cover letter if you're feeling generous :D. If you're experienced with Rails (or someone who can get up to speed with minimal training), we'd love to have you.","time":1367515912,"type":"comment"}
