We don't do contracting, work for the government, or apply for grants. We sell a product to real people that makes them happy and helps them make money.<p>Webs helps small and micro businesses get online with our in-browser web site builder and Facebook engagement tools. We do the hard technical work so that our customers can easily and beautifully build a site, improve their SEO, increase their site stats, and sell their products online.<p>We're always looking for excellent developers, whether you're front-end, back-end, or full-stack. You'll get to work with other smart people, have input into the product, contribute to open source, and enjoy our hackathons.<p>Our front-end is a great new architecture with Backbone, Less, RequireJS, and all the other new hotness. Plus our main product (a WYSIWYG website builder) is interactive enough to actually need these things to provide customer value. Our back-end is a mix of Java, Groovy, Rails and Node, with Oracle and Mongo holding the data.<p>We have a lot of fun projects coming up. If you're interested, feel free to email me at adam@webs.com and we can see if there's a good fit.","time":1367417318,"type":"comment"}
