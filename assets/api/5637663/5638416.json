And we recently closed a SEED round so we can beef up our engineering team and grow even faster.  As one of our first engineering hires, you’ll build our company and products from the ground up.<p>Our front-end runs on PHP and JavaScript (heavy jQuery).  We’re transitioning our backend from PHP to Ruby.  Our knowledge graph runs on Neo4J.  Our analytics are stored in MySQL and we use d3.js and HighCharts for reporting.  And we have a tendency to code the hard stuff (web scraper and natural language parser) in Perl.<p>Positions:<p>We're looking to hire 4+ junior and mid-level software engineers.  We prefer generalists who can focus on one of our technologies:<p>1) Social Messaging\n * Allow our staff to deploy messages on major social channels\n * Learn from the results of our messaging using powerful analytics<p>2) Knowledge Graph\n * Populate the graph using web scraping and natural language processing\n * Give users great tools for curating the graph<p>3) Social Intelligence\n * Listen to social networks, analyze the data and visualize keywords, trends and leads<p>Interested?
