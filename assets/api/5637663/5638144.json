The important part is that we have a lot of fun building and owning distributed systems and are looking for engineers who can come in and push their first feature to production within a few days of starting and who can also help us get that duration down to hours.  The stack is primarily azure/.net/C#, although there is some node.js in the house and when we do UIs we don't use biggish server-side stacks.  But when we do server-side systems we run them on 1000s of instances and support 10^5 req/sec all day, every day.<p>The key is that we own our own systems and hence our destiny.  You can't ask for anything more than that.<p>You can contact me at f00biebletch at gmail (quicker) or you can go through the official posting (slower): <a href=\"https://careers.microsoft.com/jobdetails.aspx?ss=&#38;pg=0&#38;so=&#38;rw=1&#38;jid=108925&#38;jlang=EN&#38;pp=SS\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://careers.microsoft.com/jobdetails.aspx?ss=&#38;pg=0&#...</a>","time":1367418920,"type":"comment"}
