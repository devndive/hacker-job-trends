We've hired people from these threads with everywhere from 0 to 10 years of experience. We're profitable, very well funded and have a really fun office environment (go-karts + a rock climbing wall!). We've got flexible hours, a very engineer-driven company culture, and a really terrific team.<p>Scribd alumni have gone on to found 4 other YCombinator companies, more than from any other startup. We think this says something about the kind of people that we like to hire.<p>We are still hiring interns for the summer (junior year or older).  We are also aggressively looking for international people interested in moving to the US and can help you secure a visa.<p>See more at scribd.com/jobs and feel free to email me directly: jared at scribd.com","time":1367425044,"type":"comment"}
