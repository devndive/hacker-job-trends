We aim to determine how genetic variation alters our proteins, biochemical pathways, cells, tissues, physiology, and traits&#x2F;susceptibility to disease.<p>This position involves developing a React component library for visualizing genomic data. We are looking for friendly people with demonstrated experience in web tech, an eye for design, and genuine excitement to learn new things. Experience building performant React web applications preferred. In your email, please link to an online portfolio&#x2F;github repo, and bonus points if you&#x27;ve built a nontrivial data visualization app. Technologies we use: React, Redux, D3, SVG, Python, GraphQL, elasticsearch, node, Docker, Kubernetes, Google Container Engine.<p>In this role, you&#x27;ll receive domain-specific training at a world-class research institute. We&#x27;re supportive of candidates interested in transitioning to graduate school. Your work will be 100% open source and highly visible in the genetics&#x2F;genomics community. Our tools are used by tens of thousands of researchers and physicians around the world who cure disease and make biological discoveries. Come help shape the future of human genetic data visualization and discovery!<p>email: msolomon@broadinstitute.org","time":1530544135,"type":"comment"}
