We also own a Kubernetes cluster, a Grid Engine distributed job scheduler, a pool of MariaDB database servers, and other ancillary services that technical volunteers use to gather and process data for use on the wiki projects.<p>The team is full distributed and spans from California to Spain. Remote work is our norm with communication via irc, email, bug tracker (Phabricator), and video calls. Wikimedia&#x27;s office is in SF and would be home for anyone looking for visa work.<p>Day to day work is a mix of long term projects, incident response, and tier 2-3 tech support for end-users. Ideal candidates will have a mix of operations and software development experience and some history of supporting end-users.","time":1530548015,"type":"comment"}
