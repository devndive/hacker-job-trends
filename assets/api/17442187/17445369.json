The frontend are working with next.js and react. The backend with AWS &#x2F; Terraform &#x2F; CircleCi &#x2F; Ruby &#x2F; Go.<p>One of the coolest thing we have, is that non tech people are sending us pull requests. That pull requests will generate a adhoc staging environment and domain (for the main frontend and backend app). Once the person doing the changes is happy, he&#x2F;she will send us the pull request for review to some dev. After approve, they merge it to master and it goes to production.<p>If you are lazy person that likes automation,\nIf you think the most important thing is to add value to company,\nand if you want to have autonomy within the team,<p>write me at guillermo.alvarez@tourlane.com.<p>We want to create the best travel experience, and at this stage we need one more backend and one more frontend to help us.","time":1530566062,"type":"comment"}
