Uplift Financial simplifies the process of making better financial decisions. Today, our focus is helping consumers find credit products that actually help them get on the right track - no payday loans here. As we grow, we&#x27;ll be adding new product categories until we&#x27;re a trusted advisor for every decision in our users&#x27; financial lives.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a front-end engineer to help us build and optimize elegant and usable interfaces to connect our users to these products. Our sites are built with Django (Python) on the back-end and, for now, fairly simple HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS up front. If you have strong opinions about how we could make things better, we want to hear from you.<p>We&#x27;re housed in Cogo Labs, an incubator with 10+ years&#x27; experience building businesses on the web, including EverQuote (IPO), Autotegrity (acquired, ADP), and CourseAdvisor (acquired, WaPo). Cogo&#x27;s founders were early investors in other Boston success stories like TripAdvisor and CarGurus.
