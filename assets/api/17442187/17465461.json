With over 2 million rides coordinated to date, the Scoop team has made carpooling easy for the first time - and we need a few more awesome engineers to help in the fight against traffic. The Scoop team has a simple mission: to eliminate traffic and reimagine transportation, giving life back to commuters and communities. Over three years in now, Scoop has become a vibrant community of coworkers and neighbors that have shared hundreds of thousands of commutes. Our mobile-first commuting technology powers the carpooling programs of many of the Bay Areaâ€™s largest employers, including Cisco, Tesla, Workday, and Salesforce.<p>Our stack? Node, AWS, native on iOS (all Swift) and Android. We may still be a 70-person startup, but we care deeply about testing and great technical design. And our entire matching algorithm is home-brewed. We&#x27;re hiring for Android devs, backend generalists, DevOps&#x2F;infra experts, and data lovers.  Scoop is an amazing place to work; a place where not only are you able to work on something that&#x27;s changing the day-to-day of everyday people, but where your growth is an absolute priority.<p>For more detail on our primary hiring priorities:<p>Data Engineer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;takescoop&#x2F;8d1055ac-ac0e-4613-a874-afc0dfeaf9c2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;takescoop&#x2F;8d1055ac-ac0e-4613-a874-afc0...</a><p>Infrastructure Engineer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;takescoop&#x2F;f0c07bc8-462e-48db-8476-35b427da203a\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;takescoop&#x2F;f0c07bc8-462e-48db-8476-35b4...</a><p>Android Engineer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;takescoop&#x2F;14caad6e-2c26-4840-a106-ed13f0d38c52\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;takescoop&#x2F;14caad6e-2c26-4840-a106-ed13...</a><p>Backend&#x2F;Application Engineer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;takescoop&#x2F;316986ec-34da-499c-9369-d7fd7c8f827b\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;takescoop&#x2F;316986ec-34da-499c-9369-d7fd...</a><p>We&#x27;re also hiring for other roles!
