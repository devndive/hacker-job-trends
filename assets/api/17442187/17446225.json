Hours of security camera footage is produced each second, but this footage is usually only reviewed hours after an incident has already occurred. By this time, it is often too late where preventable circumstances have resulted in irrecoverable loss.<p>We believe that by using a combination of AI and human interactions, we can produce timely and actionable insights that make the world safer, smarter and more efficient.<p>We&#x27;re expanding our teams and looking to hire full stack, backend, and machine learning engineers.
