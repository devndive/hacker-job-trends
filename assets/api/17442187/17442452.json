Check us out at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;springshare.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;springshare.com</a>. We’ve been around since 2007. Our target market is small so we’ll never go public and we won’t promise you equity worth paper millions. But, we offer a supportive small team environment where your work will have a measurable impact, competitive salary &amp; benefits, a steady job, and that great feeling that your work matters because it is improving the worlds’ libraries and schools (we are international, with client institutions in 80 countries). Come and help us grow – slow but steady.<p>5+ years professional experience with PHP or Angular, or both, is required. Experience in OOP&#x2F;MVC concepts is a must, too.<p>You must be comfortable – and highly productive – working remotely. We do have an office in NYC but everyone else works remotely. We’d prefer if you live in one of these states - NY, CA, FL, PA, MA, or KY. If you’re international, the working hours must overlap significantly with US working hours.\nSend resume to jobs@springshare.com or contact me personally (I’m the founder&#x2F;owner) at slaven@","time":1530545140,"type":"comment"}
