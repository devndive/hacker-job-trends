Screens come alive in richer, deeper, more beautiful ways. Flipping seamlessly between 2D and 3D we make mobile experiences truly immersive: no glasses, no tracking, no fuss. Alongside our display technology we are developing Leia Loft™ — a whole new canvas. A space to create, share and experience holographic content in entirely new ways.<p>We&#x27;re shipping our first consumer hardware product, the RED Hydrogen One phone, later this year. As part of this effort, we&#x27;re building a number of Android applications to allow users to create and consume 3D content. We&#x27;re a small team, and there is tons of opportunity for product ownership and engineering leadership.<p>Senior Android Developer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;d80e53651\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;d80e53651</a>\nDeep Learning and Computer Vision Engineer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;daafb6951\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;daafb6951</a>","time":1530647902,"type":"comment"}
