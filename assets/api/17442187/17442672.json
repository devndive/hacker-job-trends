Our customers range from indie designers to major celebrities like Wiz Khalifa.<p>We’re a small but growing team in NYC, looking for experienced engineers with a passion for building great experiences. As one of our earliest engineers, you’ll help define our team culture, technology choices, and roadmap, and be a key part of the next phase of our growth.<p>Our tech stack is mostly TypeScript&#x2F;node&#x2F;React&#x2F;Postgres right now, but with some other fun things in the mix too. You’ll be working across the whole stack; web, backend services and APIs, iOS and more.<p>Email d@ca.la | <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ca.la&#x2F;full-stack-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ca.la&#x2F;full-stack-engineer</a>","time":1530546590,"type":"comment"}
