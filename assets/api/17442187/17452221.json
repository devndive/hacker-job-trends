Just kidding.. but we do make men look and feel their best at their most important moments, and there&#x27;s something to be said for that!<p>Tuxedo rental is easy. Wrong! It&#x27;s a complicated service--and we&#x27;re committed to providing the best rental experience, and save you from ever having to set foot in a Men’s Wearhouse again. Just take a gander at these beautifully suited men: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;theblacktux\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;theblacktux</a>.<p>Okay, back to business--our core business model is proven and we’re poised to take over men’s formalwear market, which is why we’re expanding our Tech and Product teams to take on much greater challenges.<p>---- Tech -----<p>Manager (See levels below) — You’re a staff engineer who’s transitioned to managing development teams. You get computers, and you get people. You are a mentor, recruiter, inspirer, listener--you put people first, and you understand developers because you are one! Make no bones about it--you’re stepping into a growing development team taking on new challenges while burning down the technical debt of a startup.<p>Head of Engineering: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;theblacktux&#x2F;096e54d4-c560-4540-9ab4-5b826385ce56\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;theblacktux&#x2F;096e54d4-c560-4540-9ab4-5b...</a>\nEngineering Manager: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;theblacktux&#x2F;0e215134-b288-4e93-85d8-406f32f47614\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;theblacktux&#x2F;0e215134-b288-4e93-85d8-40...</a><p>Quality Assurance Engineer (Mid-level or higher) — You’re a seasoned automator, experienced with Selenium. You’re ready to bring automation coverage of a customer facing website from 50% to 100%--okay, maybe 100% is unrealistic... or maybe it’s not! (hahaha... Okay, let’s say from “good” to “amazing”.) Oh, and you’re excited by the prospect of standing up automation for internal tooling.\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;theblacktux&#x2F;55253478-c7de-4771-a268-b9a6aad2e1c2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;theblacktux&#x2F;55253478-c7de-4771-a268-b9...</a><p>DevOps Engineer (Junior) — You have 2+ years of experience. You’re ready to help speed up our our CI&#x2F;CD pipeline and migrate it from Codeship to Jenkins. You’re excited by the expansion of our Docker&#x2F;AWS environment and migration from ECS to Kubernetes (which is almost complete!).\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;theblacktux&#x2F;6512e676-57f5-4332-a345-9fedc4d7c55c\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;theblacktux&#x2F;6512e676-57f5-4332-a345-9f...</a><p>Software Engineer (Full Stack or Back-End, Mid-level or higher) — Your mission if you  choose to accept it: split an aging monolithic Django application into discrete services written in Python or Javascript (or another language if I could have my way! <i>shakes fist</i>). Along the way, you redesign APIs, build service infrastructure, remodel databases, and revise business processes to support new and unannounced products and services. Impossible?... I think not!<p>Lead: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;theblacktux&#x2F;3d9be859-ebba-49da-8704-f88e28836242\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;theblacktux&#x2F;3d9be859-ebba-49da-8704-f8...</a>\nSenior: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;theblacktux&#x2F;08aa7fc4-38f0-457d-8913-e03493d2b1be\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;theblacktux&#x2F;08aa7fc4-38f0-457d-8913-e0...</a>\nMid: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;theblacktux&#x2F;c473137e-1791-4a4d-b705-a45e21cf47c2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;theblacktux&#x2F;c473137e-1791-4a4d-b705-a4...</a><p>--- Product ---<p>User Experience Designer — <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;theblacktux&#x2F;729b6ad4-8807-4714-b44a-d3d8e369f994\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;theblacktux&#x2F;729b6ad4-8807-4714-b44a-d3...</a><p>Senior Product Manager, Business Operations — <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;theblacktux&#x2F;106ee0e4-9e62-438c-b2f6-a52c32abf6e1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;theblacktux&#x2F;106ee0e4-9e62-438c-b2f6-a5...</a><p>Senior Product Manager, Growth — <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;theblacktux&#x2F;973c5f76-7c36-4add-8b0c-76dab454b98f\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;theblacktux&#x2F;973c5f76-7c36-4add-8b0c-76...</a><p>If you’re hired here, you’ll be working under the wonderful Thad Hwang, previously Director of Product Management at Lyft, now Chief Product Officer at The Black Tux.
