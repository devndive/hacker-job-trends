NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable.

In October 2012, we acquired the design firm 80&#x2F;20 and have had New York based colleagues for some time now. Our logical next step was to bootstrap a NYC Engineering presence to tap in the growing community here. We just started building the Engineering team in July.<p>As a company, we have four main focuses.<p>Go international. We&#x27;re adapting what made us successful in the US abroad. This is harder than typical international plays since it requires translating our four major benefits to small merchants: 1. Shipping readers, 2. Card payments (physical world is much more complex than online), 3. Sending money quickly to our merchants, a.k.a. settlement: very localized and next-day is hard on a number of fronts), 4. Assessing risk of merchants as they sign up, aka underwriting: again, very localized most countries do have FICO scores, SSN, D&amp;B numbers and such.<p>Move up market. One of the biggest success of Square is to have enabled merchants who were &quot;non-consumers&quot; to start accepting credit cards. In classic disruptor fashion, we have essentially alonged the long tail. We haven&#x27;t been eating someone else&#x27;s lunch, we&#x27;ve created a whole new category!

We think that we can provide the best experience for consumer-to-merchant and consumer-to-consumer commerce. We&#x27;re at the infancy, but extremely well positioned to succeed.<p>Data as product. We&#x27;re leveraging our data. We know a lot about our merchants: daily sales, seasonality, growth of their business, correlation with other events (e.g. Mapping Square Payments During the Super Bowl). Lots of innovative products are in the making which will highlight the breadth of what we do.<p>In NYC, we&#x27;re starting with a focus on infrastructure, distributed systems, and money moving systems.

Bridging the gap between real estate professionals and their clients. Real estate is the largest industry in the world. It’s also one of the most important—after all, everyone needs a place to live. Millions of consumers are looking for their next home online, and they expect the same kind of browsing and buying experience they get on sites like Amazon and Facebook. Unfortunately, real estate agents are struggling to provide that experience. That’s where Placester comes in. We’re creating an industry where it&#x27;s quick and simple for real estate professionals to get their information on the web. Don’t let that simple description fool you. We’re addressing the hardest problem in the largest industry in the world. As you might have guessed, not everything is written on the home page yet.<p>Our Culture: Team. Join the team that makes a difference in a big, complex industry. Our culture is all about teamwork. That being said, we&#x27;re composed of folks who are their own brand of brilliant, focused, fun, intense, and friendly. If you&#x27;ve ever worked on a high performing team you&#x27;ve experienced this mix before. You’ll be expected to get things done and be responsible for making it happen, without any bureaucratical mess. You’ll be expected to identify problems and solve them on your own. But more importantly, you may need to rally a friend or team to overcome them. Both are key tools on your belt. You’ll be expected to have an opinion because it will matter when shaping the outcome of your company.<p>Opinions are about courage: to speak your mind and to change it. Everyone laughs a lot over lunch. Topics range from the standard technical, tactical and whos-doing-what in the start up world; but they also weave through topics like the proper structure for the US debt, that great restaurant down the street or how to Sous-vide the perfect piece of meat.

We have roughly 4,000 R&amp;D employees, so work is very diverse across the company. Teams are roughly 4-8 people at the lowest level and group up into larger organizations organized by product type (equities, fixed income, etc.). I happen to work on infrastructure for the Professional service (aka Terminal). Our team has very little interaction with anything finance related and most of our work is related to evolving the entire platform forward and making forward-looking changes. Back in 2005, we converted all of our higher-level &quot;app&quot; development to server-side JS (custom, Spidermonkey based) and now run probably the largest server-side JS stack in the world (~20MM LOC). We migrated a lot of our GUI toolkit to be scripted as well (LUA this time) to allow us to more easily evolve it. And now we&#x27;re evolving it, embedding WebKit and pushing bugfixes and feature enhancements to do what we need (our fork is on GH). We&#x27;re helping define and implement CSS3 Grid spec and help implement ES6 generators among other things. We built and run a third-party app store within the Terminal. Over the past decade we&#x27;ve rebuilt the C++ foundation of the company from the ground up, starting with our own STL implementation using the Lakos allocator model (Lakos and a few other C++ committee members work here). We have a huge wealth of awesome C++ libraries that we started open-sourcing and will continue to add more layers as time goes by.<p>All of what I mentioned above is stuff done by the infrastructure team, and we&#x27;re a tiny percentage of the overall R&amp;D population. Other teams get to do fun stuff as well. The mortgage team ported long-running ABS OAS calculations from Linux farms to GPU clusters and wrote a Python based cash flow engine from the ground up, potentially helping define the SEC&#x27;s Python-files-must-be-included rules.<p>We run a worldwide network with somewhere around 35,000 circuits in 180+ countries. We ingest anywhere from 45-60 billion &quot;ticks&quot; daily aggregate from feeds in all of these countries. We normalize, scrub, and then re-distribute all this data to customers in all of those countries in an efficient manner. The Terminal provides analytic and visualization tools to work with market data, as well as the same tools to work with news and alerts. On the news side, we ingest over 80,000 news feeds (e.g. WSJ would be one &quot;feed&quot;) from around the world and do the same kind of processing, applying ML for sentiment and topic classification, etc. We also design our own hardware in-house -- everything from keyboards and monitors, to custom ASICs for authentication&#x2F;subscription tokens and PCIe hardware security modules for our certificate infrastructure. The web side (bloomberg.com, businessweek.com, BGOV, BLAW, Black, etc) uses mostly Rails stacks and everything you would expect to find in a web shop.<p>Oh, and we have a TV station, radio station, etc. They innovate too. Bloomberg TV is the first non-OTA channel to be distributed via Aereo, for instance :)<p>We could use a motto like &quot;We do a lot of stuff.&quot;<p>Contact me if you want to discuss at andrew@ishiboo.com.

We also invest in, mentor, and incubate local startups targeting the Latin American market. We&#x27;re at the center of the rapidly emerging startup boom in Mexico.

Why not pull the rip cord and come work with us for a while?<p>What do we have to offer?\n* A vibrant, biggish (pop. 4M), student-oriented city, that&#x27;s full of hip bars, restaurants, and (really) beautiful, friendly people.\n* A work environment that is, hands down, the hippest place to work in Mexico. Imagine programming in the hammock - poolside (yes, we have a pool).\n* Use of the beach house. We have a 3 story beach house with all mod cons, 20 feet from a graceful, immaculate sandy bay in a small fishing village. Also, one of the premier left point surf breaks is 5 minutes away by boat (which we also have).\n* A chance to learn (or practice your Spanish).\n* An opportunity to be at ground zero for one of the most vibrant and rapidly expanding startup scenes in the world.\n* Beef up your resume with experience in navigating the business climate in Mexico and Latin America.\n* and, finally, ALMOST NO MONEY.

The circuit is built almost entirely in the Go language with occasional appearances of C and C++. It spans the entire lifecycle of an application, from development to execution and sustanance. It comprises technologies like compilers, interpreters, optimizers, low-level operating system management, distributed resource sharing, information flow, security, and many others. The Go Circuit is, by design, open source.<p>The goal of the circuit is to enable the possibility of encoding an entire Internet company&#x27;s infrastructure in a single executable, which can be revived with a single click on an ice-cold cluster of empty hardware and can sustain itself indefinitely, without human involvement, short of the requisite replacement of hardware now and again.<p>The demonstrated, over the past year, power of the circuit environment has compelled industry, academic and government institutions to sponsor the project and become involved with large-scale deployments. We are, henceforth, expanding.<p>RESPONSIBILITIES<p>Full-time and internship candidates have identical responsibilities.<p>Systems Engineers will work alongside the founding system architect on all aspects of the technology: design, implementation, testing, fixing bugs, writing integration drivers, documentation and research. All of their work will be open-sourced. Almost all code will be written in Go, however, other languages like Python, C, C++, Lua, JavaScript, etc. will make a presence.<p>System Engineers will be researchers as well. In designing the semantic and linguistic interfaces of the circuit, we investigate past and present, scientific and industrial, literature and software on a wide range of algorithmic topics to help us inform and verify our choices.<p>QUALIFICATIONS<p>The ideal candidate, full-time and internship, would meet the following criteria, or demonstrate an equivalent level of technical sophistication:<p>* Full-time candidates should have B.A.&#x2F;B.Sc., M.A.&#x2F;M.Sc. or Ph.D. in some hard science. Internship candidates, who are near the completion of their studies towards the mentioned degrees, are also elligible.<p>* Four or more years of experience with a low-level&#x2F;systems programming language like C, C++, or Java as well as some experience in building systems, small or big alike, is quite desirable. Altenratively, a serious involvement with a more exotic concurrent or research language, like Haskell or Erlang, would work as well.<p>* Having a non-trivial open-source project (in any language) would be highly valued.<p>* Some understanding of how UNIX operating kernels and systems work on the inside. (You don&#x27;t need to be a specialist.)<p>* Knowledge of current industrial open-source technologies is good albeit not a deal-breaker. However, interest and desire to learn and hack some of them will be needed.<p>* Ability to read academic publications in Computer Science<p>Most importantly, we are looking for individuals who are able and willing to learn fast and have open flexible minds. On that note, we do not expect that you have prior Go experience, however we do expect that<p>* Candidates will come prepared to carry out the interview in Go.<p>We are not going to test your Go-intricacies skills. We simply expect that you be able to implement your solutions to our programming riddles in Go.<p>COMPENSATION<p>Compensation will vary based on experience as we welcome both out-of-college engineers and seasoned industry scientists.

EUM complements server-side monitoring, but comes with its own set of challenges:<p>* Client-side platforms are not designed for easy instrumentation. How can we extract meaningful performance data from web browsers, iOS, and Android?<p>* Client-side performance performance is confounded by the huge variability in devices, workloads, and network latency. How can we make sense of this complex, noisy, multi-dimensional data?<p>* How can we cope with the volume of performance data flooding in from millions&#x2F;billions of users?<p>* How can we incorporate client-side and server-side data into a complete picture of app performance?<p>Here are the components of our system, and what it takes to work on them:<p>Browser Agent:<p>* Write fast, bulletproof instrumentation for JavaScript that can run inside any web app across hundreds of browser versions.<p>* Understand behavioral and performance idiosyncrasies of various browsers.<p>* Incorporate new timing specifications from W3C performance working group, but develop fallback timing techniques for other browsers.<p>Mobile Agents:<p>* Build fast, bulletproof instrumentation for iOS (Objective-C) and Android (Java) platform APIs that can run inside any app across thousands of devices.<p>* Understand mobile app architecture and frameworks, identify strategies to extract user actions, performance and system crash data.<p>* Understand iOS, Android, and Dalvik internals, and the characteristics and constraints of mobile platforms in general.<p>Cloud:<p>* This is the processing platform that receives data from the agents. It&#x27;s a scalable data processor and analytics engine (think real-time map&#x2F;reduce) built on Amazon Web Services.<p>* Process billions of end-user requests from some of the biggest sites in the world.<p>* Scale with AWS infrastructure components (EC2, S3, DynamoDB, EMR, etc).<p>* Ensure zero downtime, zero data loss, continuous deployment, multi tenant, multi \nversion, etc.<p>* Analyze huge volumes of data with statistical techniques, machine learning, predictive analysis.<p>UI:<p>* Design and build learnable, usable, data-rich HTML5 UI that helps users discover, triage, and root-cause performance problems.<p>* We use AngularJS and TypeScript.<p>I work in the EUM team and we are looking to expand.
