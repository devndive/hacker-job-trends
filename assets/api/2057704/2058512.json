We develop in Rails but we'd rather hire a smart, motivated, skilled developer and teach them Rails than hire any Rails dev and hope they turn out to be awesome.  Lots of problems to solve in data mining, personalization, scaling, business support tools, etc.  My first month here I released code supported millions of dollars of deals.<p>Good coding practices, weekly releases, code reviews, pair programming as needed, MacBook Pros + Cinema monitor for all devs, etc.  Full benefits, real (not startup-sized) salaries.<p>Contact peterc@groupon.com with any questions and I can connect you to the right people.","time":1293917504,"type":"comment"}
