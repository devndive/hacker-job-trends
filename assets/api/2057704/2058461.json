We're willing to take chances on newer developers who seem like a good fit, and also want veteran engineers who will to come in and challenge our assumptions and shake things up.<p>We're working at a scale where performance and data storage decisions start to matter. We're working with a modern stack (Redis, Python, PHP, RabbitMQ, gevent, Hive, etc), and the team we've put together is truly fantastic. 2010 was a topsy turvy year for us, but setbacks build character, and there are many reasons to be excited about where we are going. :)<p>Job specs are at jobs.digg.com , and feel free to send questions/resumes my way at wlarson@digg.com . If you're interested but concerned about the press or trajectory of Digg, definitely send an email my way, and I will send some of my optimism your way!","time":1293916383,"type":"comment"}
