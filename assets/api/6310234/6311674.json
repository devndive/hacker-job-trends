In our previous work as tutors, we realized just how awful of a process it is to try to advertise and market tutoring services on one&#x27;s own. It is even worse for the students looking for tutors. There is simply nowhere for them to go. Search Twitter for &quot;math tutor&quot; and you&#x27;ll see just how many kids go without tutors because the simply can&#x27;t find or afford them. It&#x27;s a classic problem of an inefficient market.<p>-------------------------------------------------------<p>The position is for a front-end engineer INTERN (REMOTE is OK). Our stack includes Python&#x2F;Django, Javascript&#x2F;jQuery, and Bootstrap.
