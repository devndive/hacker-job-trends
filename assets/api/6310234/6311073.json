Say you want a book. They have a variety of tools that you can use to lay out, print, and sell your book. They&#x27;re a medium sized, stable company with a cool product that people like to use.<p>As for my experiences: I&#x27;m on the web team. We&#x27;ve developed a lot of the front end stuff that users use to interact with the various book layout tools. We&#x27;re primarily a Ruby&#x2F;Rail team, though we&#x27;re taking on more Javascript frontend stuff (primarily backbone, though we&#x27;re looking into using some ember.js)<p>Blurb is a nice, stable place to work where you can come in, have a good time working, and go home at a reasonable hour. They strongly value work&#x2F;life balance, and they don&#x27;t want to burn you out. I can&#x27;t speak a ton for what it&#x27;s like to work here; as I mentioned I only recently started. But they seem to be doing a lot right.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for a solid place to work, and don&#x27;t have the fortitude to handle the ups and downs of an early stage startup (eg. if you like getting paid on time and with <i>money</i>, not stock), drop me a line: therd at blurb dot com","time":1378054499,"type":"comment"}
