Curious Minds specializes in highly disruptive mobile and web applications.<p>We are currently looking for a talented Software Engineer with strong skills in network programming and SIP&#x2F;RTP. You will build and improve our real-time SIP&#x2F;RTP-based framework &amp; applications.<p>Qualifications:\n- Strong C&#x2F;C++ programming skills\n- Strong OO &amp; multi-threaded programming skills\n- Mobile development experience\n- Network programming experience\n- SIP&#x2F;RTP development experience\n- Strong debugging skills\n- Experience dealing with bandwidth and latency issues\n- Self-Motivated\n- Good design and analytical skills\n- Good communication skills\n- Passion for real-time!<p>Desired&#x2F;Other Skills:\n- Experience with Objective-C\n- Experience with SipWise\n- Mac&#x2F;iOS development (AVFoundation)\n- Windows development\n- H264 encoding&#x2F;decoding\n- openGL\n- Knowledge of network security strategies\n- Android development\n- Familiar with Xamarin and PhoneGap<p>Product:\nShowKit is a mobile software development kit that turbo charges apps with live communication features in under 30 minutes. Before ShowKit, it would take companies and software engineers months of intensive development to add features like audio&#x2F;video conferencing, screen sharing, and gesture control to their applications. Our first-to-market gesture control functionality empowers users to tap, swipe, highlight, and fully control another users’ screen remotely while simultaneously connecting the two users via audio&#x2F;video conference.<p>Notably, ShowKit is the only framework that includes hardware accelerated video encoding &amp; decoding. This enables 720p at 30fps, the highest quality video conferencing resolution on the market, while using minimal cpu resources and allowing the app to run seamlessly in the background while a call is taking place. Comparable solutions use full cpu resources &amp; only achieve 4-5fps at that resolution, which isn’t feasible for video conferencing.<p>AngelList Profile: <a href=\"https://angel.co/showkit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;showkit</a>\nShowKit Demo Videos: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/ShowKitSDK\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;ShowKitSDK</a><p>Our Office &amp; Perks:\nOur Penthouse office sits on the historic Sunset Strip with the best view of all of LA. \n- Top of the line gear\n- Kitchen stocked full of drinks and snacks\n- Friendly and down-to-earth work environment\n- Health, Dental &amp; Vision Coverage<p>To apply: \nSend your resume and GitHub account to anthony@showkit.com","time":1378070562,"type":"comment"}
