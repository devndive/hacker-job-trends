We&#x27;re a slow, long-term project that&#x27;s trying to establish a beachhead for distinctly Indian engineering. In Indian music there is a tradition of Gharana. We&#x27;re trying to adapt that tradition to engineering which is why we&#x27;re seeking an apprentice. Qualifications might include a bachelors in computer science or engineering or in electrical engineering and a masters in a similar field. An excellent academic record is a good sign as is a keen interest in music. People who are disciplined and like to challenge the status quo would match well with us. Your level of experience does not matter too much one way or the other.<p>We pay you a pretty good salary and give you excellent equity. The position is open to everyone (not just Indians), but it&#x27;s based in a small, rather sleepy town in north India.<p>Email us at rohit@khitchdee.com.","time":1378047615,"type":"comment"}
