We teach English to millions of children in more than 30 countries.  We&#x27;ve got a unique mix of social networking with learning, where kids can make friends all over the world to practice their English, with enough help along the way that they&#x27;ll never get stuck.\nThe company is currently expanding from web clients onto tablet and mobile and is revamping it&#x27;s products to better fit how kids learn today.<p>Cloud services are essential to what we do, and we&#x27;re looking for a lead engineer looking for a challenge who is comfortable in coaching a team to build a robust and scalable solution which includes messaging, scoring mechanisms, achievements and a whole lot more.  \nWe&#x27;re developing layered services using PHP and Zend Framework, MySQL, noSQL and message queuing among others. Essential skills also should include developing applications for HA and scalability in cloud environments (clustering, replication, load balancing), Linux admin, Apache&#x2F;Nginx, IP networking, network&#x2F;application security, unit testing and release management.\nAlthough the current server infrastructure is developed using PHP we are open to using other languages and technologies if you can justify the changes within technical and commercial constraints.<p>We don&#x27;t require a formal education in computer science but we expect a working knowledge in areas such as time and space complexity of common algorithms and data structures, operating systems fundamentals, database theory, concurrency and experience with dynamically and statically typed languages.\nUltimately we want someone who understands and can discuss technological details at a fundamental level and is able to justify design choices and lead a team through the use of solid technical arguments.<p>An interest in educational products is a must!<p>Send an email to jobs@littlebridge.com, with a CV and a little about yourself and let&#x27;s talk.","time":1378050651,"type":"comment"}
