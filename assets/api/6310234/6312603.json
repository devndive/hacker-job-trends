We just want strong engineers who can learn anything.<p>----------------<p>We are a distributed team, with folks in Darwin, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, UK\nThat being said, for these development positions we are aiming for folks in Adelaide (will work from an office) or Brisbane (work from home with occasional face 2 face).<p>- working remotely is hard, please consider if you have the maturity to work unsupervised, and the ability to work in physical solitude without going crazy.<p>----------------<p>What your working week will look like:<p>- lots of new software development\n- some support of existing products and systems, bug fixing, enhancements\n- few meetings<p>So, if you are voracious learner, an initiative taking developer, likes hard stuff, cares about what they build, then we would love to hear from you.<p>Cheers,<p>Adam Webber","time":1378077274,"type":"comment"}
