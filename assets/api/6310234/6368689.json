Our goal is to make the human genome practically useful for life-altering decisions.<p>We invented the Counsyl Test, a breakthrough diagnostic intended for parents planning to start a family. It was featured in the New York Times, named one of Scientific American’s Top 10 World Changing Ideas, and won the Wall Street Journal Innovation Award for Medicine. Our test is now being used for 12% of all carrier screens in the United States.<p>The cost of sequencing human genomes is plunging - over 5x faster than the cost of computing; the potential impact on preventive healthcare and the medical landscape is boundless. The science is there but the scale isn’t. \nThat’s where Counsyl comes in. We are building the technology platform to make genomics useful and accessible to everyone.<p>The vast majority of our operations are powered by our own custom-built infrastructure on a Python&#x2F;Django&#x2F;Postgres stack, from ordering to lab processing to billing. We’re building new tools, new workflows, and new infrastructure to solve the challenging problems of a technology startup involved with not just bits, but also interconnected physical components like lab robotics and patient samples.<p>We&#x27;re hiring:<p>Software Engineers (<a href=\"https://www.counsyl.com/jobs/software-engineer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.counsyl.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;software-engineer&#x2F;</a>) \nWeb Developers (<a href=\"https://www.counsyl.com/jobs/software-engineer-web-dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.counsyl.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;software-engineer-web-dev&#x2F;</a>)<p>And many more positions at <a href=\"http://jobs.counsyl.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.counsyl.com</a>","time":1378921756,"type":"comment"}
