We think the current sate of customer communications tools is a messâ€”a bunch of disjoint tools designed to reduce human contact, encouraging massively impersonal customer experiences. We&#x27;re building one, simple platform for all web and mobile businesses to connect with their customers. Thousands of companies have replaced customer support, email marketing, CRM, marketing automation tools with our product. We have raised $7.75MM to-date. We have extremely solid revenue and revenue growth. We have amazing team of ex. Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon engineers and designers. We think we can be a very, very valuable, and impactful business. We love talented, big-thinking, happy and creative people. We hate short-term thinkers, self-promoters, big egos.<p>San Francisco<p>Product Marketing\nContent Marketing\nFinancial Analyst\nVisual Designer\nSupport Engineers <a href=\"https://www.intercom.io/jobs/support\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intercom.io&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;support</a>\nOps Engineers <a href=\"https://www.intercom.io/jobs/ops\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intercom.io&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;ops</a><p>Dublin<p>Product Engineers\nProduct Designers <a href=\"https://www.intercom.io/jobs/design\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intercom.io&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;design</a>\nProject Manager <a href=\"https://www.intercom.io/jobs/design/project_manager\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intercom.io&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;design&#x2F;project_manager</a>\niOS Engineers\nVisual Designers<p>Contact Macey in confidence: macey@intercom.io","time":1378088097,"type":"comment"}
