Banks, breweries, engineers, truckers, market researchers, charities and tattoo parlours use us everyday to make their work easier.<p>Our server-side infrastructure is AWS-hosted Rails apps that allow our customers to build their forms, manage their devices, and direct and access their submission data. Our (native) mobile apps all receive their forms and deliver their submissions through this infrastructure, and we have a rich external API through which many customers manage all of this.<p>We&#x27;re looking to build up a team in Durham to work on all aspects of this, from scaling and reliability to tackling the wonderfully long list of features we have on our roadmap. Competitive salaries, and equity.<p>Reach out to me (Mike, cofounder) at mikew@devicemagic.com if you&#x27;d like to know more.","time":1378118529,"type":"comment"}
