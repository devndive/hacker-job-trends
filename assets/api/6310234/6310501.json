Currently looking for an all-round developer who can work at either location.<p>We work on all kinds of stuff, from websites and applications to smartphone apps, games, and our own products. Some of the projects we&#x27;ve been involved with include the new Rijksmuseum website, national transit platform 9292.nl, the Philips Hue lights, and the Staatsloterij. We have a published game, Quento (quento.com) and a product, Handcraft (handcraft.com). We love working with C#, App Engine, and Java, but whatever works for the client works for us. We also host meetups about all kinds of topics, from how best to use ElasticSearch (we&#x27;re a partner) to Meteor (our website runs on it) and which JS MVC framework to choose.<p>Our work is primarily technical, so you&#x27;ll be expected to be able to dive in wherever needed - frontend or backend - and contribute whatever skills you have to our diverse dev teams. Earlier this year we were awarded the &quot;best workplace in the Netherlands&quot; prize by Great Place to Work.<p>See q42.com for more info and our Dutch blog post about the position: <a href=\"http://q42.nl/blog/post/57695336048/knappe-koppen-gezocht\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;q42.nl&#x2F;blog&#x2F;post&#x2F;57695336048&#x2F;knappe-koppen-gezocht</a> (Dutch fluency not required, but you must be willing to learn)<p>Interested?
