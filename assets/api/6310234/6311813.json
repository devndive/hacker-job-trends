Over 250k small businesses around the country have joined Thumbtack, and we&#x27;re making real money in the local services marketplace.<p>The team is full of down-to-earth, practical, and intelligent people. Everyday for lunch we all sit down to a meal cooked by our in-house chef. On Wednesday nights, we stay late for a hot dinner, some wine, guests, and great conversation. Sometimes we drink beer that we&#x27;ve been brewing in the back closet.<p>Ping me (chris @) if you want to chat. Happy to meet up for coffee if you&#x27;re in SF. I&#x27;ll also be in Boston&#x2F;Pittsburgh in the coming weeks.<p><a href=\"http://www.thumbtack.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thumbtack.com&#x2F;jobs</a>","time":1378064691,"type":"comment"}
