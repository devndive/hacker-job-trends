We&#x27;re solving interesting problems and building cool things in nearly every software engineering discipline.<p>We&#x27;re hiring across the board - frontend, mobile, devops, data scientists, data warehousing, and pretty much anything and everything in between.<p>Our core web&#x2F;api platform is a traditional LAMP stack, but we use a ton of other technologies as well including: Python, Java, Hadoop, Solr&#x2F;Lucene, CouchBase, Backbone, d3.js, Sass, Git, etc.<p>The company has a fantastic culture that puts a focus on exploring new ideas and technologies. As an example, one of our VPs dropped what he was doing and built one of the very first Google Glass apps after it was released.<p>We have quarterly hack weeks, mind&#x2F;body&#x2F;spirit days, unlimited vacation time, great health benefits, full kitchens, and a roof top patio that&#x27;s hard to beat on a sunny Friday evening.<p>This is the third or fourth time I&#x27;ve posted to HN and we are getting great responses (we&#x27;ve already hired three or four engineers from these posts).
