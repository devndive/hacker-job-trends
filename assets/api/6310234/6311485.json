We also think publishers should be rewarding users for being active on their favorite games, apps, and websites. Pretio was started to solve this.<p>We do two basic things:<p>1. We run online loyalty programs with real-world rewards that we secure from our advertisers. We then make these loyalty programs available to content publishers so that they can reward their users, free of charge.<p>2. We offer those rewards to other online loyalty and engagement programs for their customers, too.<p>About the Job:\nWe’re looking for a talented front-end developer with design chops, who’s comfortable with owning and iterating on the design of our product’s UI. You’ll be primarily responsible for the design and direction of our new user-facing features, with your work being seen by millions of people.
