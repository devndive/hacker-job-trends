This means writing code that improves the lives of our customers (series seed and series A companies) and their millions of email subscribers.<p>We&#x27;re using a powerful, modern, lean tech stack (Scala, Play! Framework, AngularJS, ElasticSearch, Postgres, CoffeeScript, LESS) that allows us to ship code to production many times a day. Not familiar with some of these? No problem- we&#x27;ll give you more than enough time to ramp up and learn.<p>Working on a small, nimble team like ours means that there&#x27;s no bureaucracy and no red tape- we like to move fast and get shit done.<p>You&#x27;ll get to work with us at our office at Kleiner Perkins&#x27; startup incubation space in SoMa.<p>Interested? You can take a look at our jobs page <a href=\"http://iterable.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;iterable.com&#x2F;jobs</a> or personally drop me a note at andrew@ [mycompanydomain].
