Our clients come from heavy industry -- civil engineering, construction, shipping, manufacturing, etc. -- where information technology stagnated a decade ago.  This is our opportunity.  We&#x27;ve built a business around providing modern, user-centric web and mobile applications to replace their aging and clunky desktop programs.  Enterprise doesn&#x27;t have to suck.<p>Being a small company, you&#x27;ll be given a lot of autonomy and chances to learn.  At a large firm, you may spend a decade contributing your small piece to a vast legacy sourcebase.  We start 6 new projects a year.  Iterate rapidly and improve your skills.<p>Inquiries can be sent to me -- adam@concretedata.com.","time":1378061585,"type":"comment"}
