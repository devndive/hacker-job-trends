Over the past five years, Wealthfront has built a technology company focused on re-architecting the finance industry, and along the way we’ve created a new category known as automated investment services (aka ‘robo-advisors’, but truth be told we’re fairly light on robots). What that actually means is we build software that enables us to democratize access to services typically reserved for the ultra-wealthy, and through automation we can deliver those services to investors at an incredibly low cost. And it’s working; we have clients across the country who trust us with over $8 billion in assets -- and we’re just getting started!<p>We are hiring across the board, but are specifically looking for DevOps Engineers, iOS Engineers and Android Engineers.<p>Feel free to check out the job descriptions and apply here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;wealthfront\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;wealthfront</a> (please mention Hacker News in application).","time":1512510016,"type":"comment"}
