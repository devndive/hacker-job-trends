We&#x27;re currently changing the landscape of personal savings by combining behavioural economics, findings from cognitive behavioral therapy, a tight user experience with technology.<p>We&#x27;re a mixed bunch of around 30 people: developers, behavioral scientists, data scientists and pretty much everything in between. Oddly enough, we only have one ex-banker involved in the mix – casual dresscode all week long :)<p>You will be working with our existing platform, ultimately helping people learn how to best realize their own dreams. In a nutshell, how they spend less on crap and channel those savings into things dreams are made of. It&#x27;s pretty awesome.<p>The tooling we use vary from component to component as the architecture is by design built to support multiple languages and platforms. Today, we like using Ruby, NodeJS and Elixir – constantly looking for even better tools for solving problems. Bringing your own knowledge and experience into the mix is highly encouraged.<p>Feeling intrigued?
