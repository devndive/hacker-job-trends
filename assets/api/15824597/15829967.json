Neuralink&#x27;s aim is to bring humans and machines closer so software forms a true extension of ourselves, rather than something separate we interact with slowly and awkwardly.<p>We are hiring for a fairly diverse set of technical backgrounds. There is a ton of software to write ranging from firmware to surgical robotics control to an experiment management web app. Experience with C++ for robotics is especially desirable. \nCulturally, we place a premium on diligence, care and thoroughness rather than trying out every latest cool framework.<p>If you are up for the challenge check out our website: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neuralink.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neuralink.com</a>","time":1512185334,"type":"comment"}
