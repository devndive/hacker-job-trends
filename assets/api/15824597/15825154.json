We don’t just do IT, we also help our customers grow business wise. We are a young company yet growing like crazy - the story began in March 2017 with just the three founders and one employee. Now we’ve grown into a multitalented team of 13 people.<p>We’re looking for a talent to take our app development and integrations to the next level. The magic words in this case are Javascript(React) and Ruby on Rails. We hope you’ve already gained some professional experience.<p>We will gladly tell you more about us and our mission - and also about the open position! Send us an email at woolman@woolman.io or leave an open application on our career page career.woolman.io. You can find our contact information on our webpage as well.<p>You would be working mostly with me(milep, long time HN lurker). I&#x27;m always interested in improving my coding skills and I&#x27;m looking for a sparring partner. I&#x27;ll try to use functional coding style whenever I can. Clojure would be fun but we use RoR for pragmatic reasons.","time":1512147514,"type":"comment"}
