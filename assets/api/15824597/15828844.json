We plug into conferencing and call recording solutions and parse out the skills that people are using on the phone to make recommendations about how they can improve. We provide the quickest and most reliable way to judge what content and sales tactics drive the most successful results on the phone, without having to listen to a single phone call. Using the call data companies already have, we automatically identify winning behaviors and help spread those best practices to the entire team. Weâ€™re working with some of the largest sales and support teams in the US and have raised funding from Accel, Founders Fund, Lowercase, YC, and others.<p>Our long term vision is to own the space of business conversations by expanding into other verticals where conversations are part of the every day workflow, such as fundraising, recruiting, political campaigning, healthcare, banking, etc.<p>To apply choose a position on this list <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voiceops.com&#x2F;careers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voiceops.com&#x2F;careers.html</a> and then submit your information via AngelList or directly to jobs@voiceops.com.","time":1512172020,"type":"comment"}
