Out of this passion, we’ve developed the world’s first wearable power meter for runners that provides insight into their running technique and performance. Stryd is currently being used by many different national Olympic teams, professional running teams, and many competitive track&#x2F;road&#x2F;mountain runners.<p>Stryd already has the world’s best foot motion tracking model built in house, and we plan to expand this model to more type of running applications (hiking, running in the sand, etc.) This is a very challenging algorithm problem with unlimited possibilities.<p>You will be in charge of improving our current model, as well as designing and developing new sensor fusion algorithms addressing current and future Stryd products and motion tracking applications. You also need to take active role in identifying new trends in research related to sensor fusion, motion tracking, optimization theory, machine learning.<p>Requirements:<p>1. Degree in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, or equivalent required.<p>2. Experience with inertial sensors, GPS technology, and machine learning algorithms.<p>3. Excellent knowledge of Matlab&#x2F;C required.<p>4. Ability to understand, design, complex algorithms correctly in Matlab&#x2F;Python and implement in C efficiently.<p>5. Strong mathematical&#x2F;physics&#x2F;analytical background preferred. Previous relevant research experience preferred.<p>Being able to relocate to Boulder is required. BTW, if you like running, Boulder is pretty much your dream place. You get tons of opportunities to run and train with LOTS of elite athletes who are Stryd ambassadors here.<p>Salary &amp; equity depends on experience.<p>If interested, please send an email to kun@stryd.com<p>Thanks!","time":1512181465,"type":"comment"}
