The primary skill set includes HTML, JavaScript, CSS, React, with responsive and mobile-friendly web design. Full stack skills and&#x2F;or React Native and mobile development skills would be helpful, but are not required. You should be able to operate without full designs, and indeed we would be looking to you for best practices in the design and layout of webpages.<p>The initial trial period would involve some small improvements to existing websites, and eventually ramping up to 5-10 hours per week and including some brand new applications. Our basic development process would involve you interacting with us on Slack and GitHub, completing tasks and communicating progress as you go. Feel free to maintain a flexible schedule with little-to-no overlap with our California timezone. We can also pay you in Bitcoin, if you&#x27;d prefer. :)<p>Contact me (Benjamin) for more information: blouis AT unquietcode.com","time":1512511512,"type":"comment"}
