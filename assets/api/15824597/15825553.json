We’re changing the way 1st party advertising works at eBay. Currently, we fix search river “ads” into specific locations even when those “ads” are items already for sale on eBay. Search for “iphone case” and you will see sponsored listings at specific fixed locations on the page (Slot 4,5). We’re going to challenge the fixed slot model and let sponsored listings change slots dynamically based on factors such as salability, monetization and relevance. This involves big changes to internal goals and algorithmic optimizations. The details are still being worked out so there is plenty of white space for innovation. If you are entrepreneurial, can fight for and code the right solutions we want you.<p>Ask for Adam\njobs@ebaynyc.com","time":1512149836,"type":"comment"}
