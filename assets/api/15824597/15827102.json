Managing an organization of hundreds or thousands of people is several orders of magnitude more difficult. Strategy is often impossible to orchestrate, implementing any amount of change happens at a glacial pace. Keeping an organization on the same path becomes a near-impossible task. Pathlight offers up a solution to this monumental problem through what we call management automation.<p>Pros:<p><pre><code>  - Green field development  \n  - Real world problems. The kind that companies pay $100K+ to solve\n  - Experienced founders. This is our 2nd startup - our first was acquired in 2013\n  - Well-funded and well-run. Series A, low burn. Capital efficiency is important to us\n  - Product market fit. Companies already using it every day\n</code></pre>\nCons:<p><pre><code>  - Very early. Very uncertain\n  - Weâ€™re not going to match your offer from Facebook\n  - No free lunches, gym memberships, massages, etc. But, we do have several flavors of La Croix\n  - We play Yacht Rock on Fridays\n\n</code></pre>\nOur top priority is in finding a Lead Data Engineer, if this sounds anything like you, I&#x27;d love to hear from you:<p><pre><code>  - Have experience with data pipelining, warehousing, ETL (bonus: Presto, Spark, Redshift)\n  - Not shy of SQL (bonus: PostgresQL, Hive)\n  - Proficient in Python (bonus: Django, Celery)\n  - Have experience modelling data (bonus: sklearn, numpy, pandas)\n</code></pre>\nWe are also looking for Full-Stack Engineers, Product Managers, Designers, and more.
