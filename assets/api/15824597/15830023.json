By capturing or representing all the light rays, you can determine what a user would have seen from any possible perspective. This is superior to traditional, 3D model-based imaging, because it doesn&#x27;t look like a video game. Our approach is more photographic than other approaches, and leads to realistic images. While most of the work is software, we do have a huge pile of cameras and work closely with the film industry.<p>The problem space is very complex, involving the latest math and algorithms, and combining ideas from a huge, dizzying number of technical fields. So you don&#x27;t need to be an expert in everything to apply, just have a passion for hard problems, be willing to work on a team, and be excited to learn (and teach). We have three open positions, but we will try to build a role for the right candidate.<p>Algorithms Engineer, Light Field Imaging: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;visby&#x2F;5f861491-fe0f-4003-99ab-01f9456a1f5d\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;visby&#x2F;5f861491-fe0f-4003-99ab-01f9456a...</a><p>Research Engineer, Light Field Imaging: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;visby&#x2F;5ae6b083-ffec-4b1e-89db-8d81342b3bab\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;visby&#x2F;5ae6b083-ffec-4b1e-89db-8d81342b...</a><p>Software Engineer, Virtual Reality: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;visby&#x2F;662abcfa-6d30-4844-951a-75f1796eee1d\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;visby&#x2F;662abcfa-6d30-4844-951a-75f1796e...</a>","time":1512186547,"type":"comment"}
