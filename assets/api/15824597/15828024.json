Join CloseGap as the Dir. of Tech and continue developing app from current iteration (private beta). We have happy users and we&#x27;re growing!\nYou must be a civic-minded, technical ninja, excited to work at the intersection of technology and social impact. You are a boss at Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and PostgreSQL. In the past, youâ€™ve worked on a prototype, MVP or beta, have spoken to customers and have integrated their feedback into product development. You are familiar with lean&#x2F;agile development methodologies. You&#x27;re a good human and want to use your technology powers for good =) CloseGap is a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) nonprofit. There&#x27;s no ownership in nonprofits so full disclosure, equity isn&#x27;t available. With that being said, CloseGap is epic so if you&#x27;re cool with not having a physical stake, this is still an idea and organization that can be grown in a huge way. Calling this position Dir. of Tech for now, however, if it goes well, this will become the CTO&#x2F;Cofounder role!<p>If this sounds interesting, please email your resume to rachel@closegap.org.
