We are committed to open science and everything we do is open source.  We currently develop in Scala, Spark, Python and C&#x2F;C++ but will use any tools we need to get the job done.  Come help us build the future of big scientific data analysis.<p>We have multiple positions open:<p>1. We&#x27;re looking for skilled senior&#x2F;principal engineers who have a solid CS&#x2F;engineering background, can quickly write clear, correct code and have experience working on large, complex projects.
