Our small, dedicated, and compassionate team is looking for an exceptional full-stack engineer to help us in the quest for ever greater public access to information. Join us in our efforts at the main NYPL branch location (of Ghostbusters fame) and you&#x27;ll experience the pleasure of working full-time on open-source software, enjoy a healthy work-life balance, and sleep well at night knowing you&#x27;re doing what&#x27;s best for library patrons, not someone else&#x27;s bottom line.<p>Our ideal candidate is a generalist with experience writing single-page applications who is eager to contribute across the stack. Our front-end makes use of TypeScript, React, and Redux. Our back-end employs a mixture of languages atop PostgreSQL, AWS, and a microservice architecture. In addition to command of the technologies mentioned (or similar SPA- and RDBMS-focused approaches), a working knowledge of Git, familiarity with the EPUB format, experience building accessible web applications, and a good understanding of functional programming are major plusses.<p>Ready to improve the experiences of library patrons around the US? Send your résumé to &quot;nypldigitaljobs@nypl.org&quot; and let us know!","time":1512155255,"type":"comment"}
