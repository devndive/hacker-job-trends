We are looking to hire an additional software developer with solid \nUnix&#x2F;Linux skills and (if possible) a good knowledge of computer security. We work from home and communicate via text and vid\neo chat. We work 40-hour weeks with flexible hours, but we try to overlap as much as possible with 10am-4pm Eastern Time. We \nare currently working on about five different projects, each written in one or more of five different programming languages. \nThese projects are small, ranging from one to three developers each. Nearly everyone works on at least two different projects\n, so we all need to be competent in more than one language. Some of us started as system administrators and later became soft\nware developers. Others are pure developers with solid Unix&#x2F;Linux skills.<p><pre><code>  - Work from home!\n  - Relaxed atmosphere\n  - 40 hour work weeks\n</code></pre>\nYou must have an active DoD security clearance.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;parsonsjob.neocities.org&#x2F;dev.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;parsonsjob.neocities.org&#x2F;dev.html</a>","time":1512160999,"type":"comment"}
