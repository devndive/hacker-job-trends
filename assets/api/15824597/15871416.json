Our clients are companies that work on transitioning our society to a future of sustainable energy by selling, designing and installing solar installations. Aurora enables them to do their job better, faster, and more efficiently. Aurora is a cloud-based SaaS solution that allows solar installers to build 3D models of buildings and trees, simulate the impact of shading on a homeowner&#x27;s roof, design advanced solar systems, calculate the financial return of a solar system and generate beautiful sales proposals. By enabling solar installers to do all of this in a short time and without having to leave their office, Aurora helps to reduce the cost of solar installations and make solar energy more widely available.\nFrontend Techstack: Ember, Coffee&#x2F;Javascript\nBackend Techstack: Ruby on Rails, Postgres\nIf you&#x27;re interested in working with us, email me at mklocker@aurorasolar.com.
