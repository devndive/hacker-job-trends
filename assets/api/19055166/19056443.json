We are a small business in the US looking to hire a backend or DevOps engineer to work remotely with our team full or part time. The team is several engineers already, and you would be joining them in supporting our ongoing internal and external projects by helping to set up and provision backend systems and services, as well as some light application programming like API servers.<p>Our work is a combination of in-house projects with external client engagements filling in the gaps. For this role we would be looking for deep experience with back-end and infrastructure technologies like Amazon AWS or Google GCP, provisioning tools like Ansible &#x2F; Puppet &#x2F; Salt, Python development, shell scripting, Linux system administration, docker and containerization technologies, build and deploy servers, CloudFormation and Terraform for infrastructure management, as well as some basic networking skills. There will also be tasks involving setting up backend components like databases, job queues, and micro-services.<p>This is a great role for mid or senior level engineers who are looking for flexibility and some independence in how their work gets completed. Do note that while we are excited to be growing our business and adding a new position this year, we will likely remain a small team for the foreseeable future. We are also not a traditional ‘product’ company, and most of our time is spent on smaller applications and projects that eventually reach completion.<p>If you would like to know more, send a message to hiring@onzininc.com with your questions. To apply, please send a resume and few remarks about your background and technical experience to the same address. Thank you for reading, and good luck out there!","time":1549043414,"type":"comment"}
