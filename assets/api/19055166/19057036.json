We use our tech to automate and enable, and aim to deliver relevant data and insight to our clients much more quickly than our competitors are able. We feel there&#x27;s a window of opportunity open to us to disrupt the market research industry which is, in many ways, quite slow moving and traditional.<p>Our tech team comprises 15 people, mostly developers, along with two UX designers. I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say based at, but we&#x27;re centred on The Bradfield Centre in Cambridge, UK. However, most of our team work from home at least some of the time, and we have three substantially remote members. We&#x27;ve become quite proficient at working whilst spread out geographically so we&#x27;re quite open to full-time remote workers as well. On top of this we also offer a 35 hour work week and flexible working hours.<p>Our stack is SQL Server, C#&#x2F;.NET, TypeScript and React for all new systems over the past 18 months and going forward. We have various technologies in our legacy codebase, including JQuery, Angular, MVC and - in our desktop tools - CEF, WPF and WinForms (sorry!). The upcoming year will see something of a sea change with increasing using of R and Python, along with the latter&#x27;s ecosystem of statistical, data mining, NLP, and ML libraries and integrations.<p>We are hiring at least half a dozen talented software engineers at all levels of experience to join us. We&#x27;re also looking for a couple of user experience designers with up to 3 years experience who our senior designers can mentor and develop. Regardless of our role, youâ€™ll be working on our end to end market research, data, and insight delivery platform.<p>We are happy to pursue sponsorship for the right candidates looking to relocate to the UK.<p>TO APPLY:<p>Software Developers - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;migglobal.bamboohr.co.uk&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;view.php?id=3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;migglobal.bamboohr.co.uk&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;view.php?id=3</a>\nUX Designers - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;migglobal.bamboohr.co.uk&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;view.php?id=6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;migglobal.bamboohr.co.uk&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;view.php?id=6</a>","time":1549046327,"type":"comment"}
