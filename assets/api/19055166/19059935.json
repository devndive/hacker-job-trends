Our first rocket, the RS1, will be a highly-capable, cost-effective vehicle for placing small satellites into orbit. We are looking for experienced software engineers to help us build out the information systems that serve as the technological foundation for critical operations across the company.<p>Our in-house software team currently has one member (that&#x27;s me), so this is an opportunity to have a huge impact as the company works toward the first launch next year.  We are builing a comprehensive set of tools that facilitate engineering design, factory build operations, test campaigns, inventory management, full part traceability, supply chain oversight, part procurement, and launch site procedures â€“ to name a few. \nIt&#x27;s not every day that a web application helps launch stuff into space! I personally find it very rewarding to wake up each morning and contribute to this exciting mission and push humanity a tiny bit further out into the cosmos.<p>The backend is a python Flask app, and our frontend is written with React + Mobx. Experience in those technologies is not required, but we are looking for engineers comfortable across the stack and who proactively seek out and learn what is required to solve the problem at hand.<p>If this sounds interesting at all, please reach out. I would love to talk. My e-mail: waltrip@ablspacesystems.com","time":1549065203,"type":"comment"}
