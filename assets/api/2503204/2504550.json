We're not a typical LBS startup :)<p>We're small, just 3 of us currently. You'll get a huge amount of freedom to choose our technology and platform. Right now our proof of concept is LAMP, but I know we'll need something better for high volume TCP traffic.<p>If you're interested in dealing with real location data, high traffic environments and delivering a reliable product contact me.<p>ryan@gibitechnologies.com","time":1304297817,"type":"comment"}
