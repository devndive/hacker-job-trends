There are lots of interesting product, algorithm, gaming, infrastructure and scaling challenges. We're using Python (not Django), but we're not language-religious. Anyone who loves web tech, big problems, big systems, design, products and programming might be a good fit.<p>We're also giving people who join our technology team a budget of $4001 to build their ideal dev environment (monitors, systems, mobile devices). <a href=\"http://smarterer.com/blog/2011/04/21/4001-ways-youll-help-us-build-smarterer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://smarterer.com/blog/2011/04/21/4001-ways-youll-help-us...</a><p>Sorry, no remote right now. The early core team needs to be local to really gel (just from my personal and previous startup experience).<p>if you're interested, email me: mikepk@smarterer.com","time":1304284301,"type":"comment"}
