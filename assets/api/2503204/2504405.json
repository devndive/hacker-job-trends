We run on the major real time bidding platforms, processing over a billion impressions per day. You'd be joining a small and talented technology team and would have an immediate role in building out the core platform. We play with a lot of cool technology, including low latency NoSQL stores, massive reporting databases, and large scale traffic handling. Java experience required. Looking for people to do server-side development, front-end skills (HTML/CSS/JS) are a big plus.<p>Competitive salary, good benefits, stock options, free lunches.\nH1B is a possibility (haven't checked officially, but if there's interest I'll inquire)<p>Contact me on gmail - nick.kleinschmidt","time":1304293203,"type":"comment"}
