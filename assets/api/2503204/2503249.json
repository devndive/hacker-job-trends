Our early products were all about superimposing cell phone coverage for carriers on a world map for them to embed in their websites. Now we have a platform for in-browser comparative analysis of arbitrary spatial information. We currently load it up with information about the wireless, cable, and telecom industries.<p>I'm looking for talented engineers who can get down and dirty with optimization, configuration management, distributed systems, or architecture design.<p>Stuff you'll be fooling with: Solr, HDFS, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Chef, EC2, Javascript, Ruby, and C. Knowledge of Pacemaker/Heartbeat, Chubby/ZooKeeper, AMQP, Flume/Scribe, BigTable/Dynamo inspired systems, or Scala is a plus.<p>We also have a position open for a junior developer if these are things you find interesting and you're willing to learn. That position would be more focused on Javascript and Rails work initially.<p><a href=\"http://www.americanroamer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.americanroamer.com/</a><p><a href=\"http://www.cellmaps.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cellmaps.com/</a><p><a href=\"http://www.mapelements.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mapelements.com/</a>","time":1304266400,"type":"comment"}
