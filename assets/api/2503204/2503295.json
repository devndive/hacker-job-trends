We're currently looking for a fulltime mid-level software developer.  This would be working at our office on the north side of Columbus.<p>What do we is sell apparel online (mostly geared towards women), that can be customized using our web-based design center.  The main technologies are Perl/Flash/Javascript/HTML5 in an EC2 Linux/MySQL environment, although of course desire and ability to learn is fine in lieu of having experience with these specific technologies.<p>It's a fairly laid back work environment, and since the team (and company) is small, technical experimentation and lack of bureaucracy is pretty much the norm.  We have several new initiatives in the works, so that's why we need to hire another developer.<p>Any involvement in development activities outside of work is a definite plus.  Feel free to visit our website, take a look around, and send your info to jobs@eretailing.com if you're interested...","time":1304267414,"type":"comment"}
