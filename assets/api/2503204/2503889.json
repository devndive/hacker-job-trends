(If you're looking for an internship, we can probably create a paid position for you.) Few people know what's going on in their state governments, even though that's where a lot of the things that affect people's day-to-day lives get decided. We're fixing that by making it easier for people to find the information that they should care about.<p><a href=\"http://trib.it/ttdevjob\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://trib.it/ttdevjob</a> / nbabalola@texastribune.org","time":1304279809,"type":"comment"}
