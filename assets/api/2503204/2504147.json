{"by":"decklin","id":2504147,"parent":2503204,"text":"Newton, MA - Full Time (also remote, see below)<p>Sonian provides a large-scale email archiving platform resold by several vendors you may have heard of. We run entirely on EC2, and Amazon was an investor in our Series B ($9M). We use Clojure for our backend, Rails for the frontend, and Chef to manage infrastructure (i work in the latter group). We are expanding, but the devs all know each other and we work in cross-functional teams whenever possible.<p>The development teams are mostly remote and use tmux/Skype to pair program. Our VP of E is looking for a Director of Development, however, and for this someone local is preferable. We're looking for someone with experience not just building reliable applications at scale but managing remote teams to do so. We have a longer formal posting ready, but it's not up yet so email me (decklin@red-bean.com) for more info.<p>Also, if you're a Chef expert or just an ops-and-dynamic-languages hacker who loves to learn new things, but not interested in management, please contact me too! Any location. I'd love to make the case for another devop on my team. A full posting for that is up at <a href=\"http://www.sonian.com/about/careers/development-operations-engineer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sonian.com/about/careers/development-operations-e...</a>.<p>Perks: get flown out to Boston twice a year (or if like me you're already here, Sushi Thursdays :-)), MacBook Pro or ThinkPad, good benefits.<p>For both positions, please contact jobs@sonian.net and let them know that I (Decklin Foster) referred you. Thanks!","time":1304285703,"type":"comment"}
