As an AOL subsidiary,\nwe've got employees who work out of AOL offices around the world so it wouldn't\nbe unheard of to work from e.g. Seattle or New York if you decide Denver's just got\ntoo much sunshine. I've also been told we will sponsor an H1B.<p>Over the past year, MapQuest has brought on an almost entirely new management\nteam to shake things up and change the direction of the company from answering\nthe ? \"How do I get there?\" to answering the more interesting ? \"Where do I want to\ngo?\" We've released two new products in the last year (Discover and Local, formerly\nknown as Vibe) and are aggressively working on creating an engineering-driven\nculture that actually builds things people might want to use instead of polishing\nproducts that were cool in 2004. We've had a banner year, and are looking to hire\nengineers as well as product managers to continue this upward trend.<p>Among the technical roles we're looking to fill are several Ruby developers at\nvarying levels of expertise to help develop new products as well as one Java\ndeveloper to work with our data team and revamp various backend services\n(i.e. search, geocoding and a data ingestion service that populates our location\ndatabases). Ever since Valve leaked their company handbook, the phrase \"T shaped\"\nhas been been thrown around a lot by upper management, so you'll need to be\nable to do full-stack development. We do a lot of pair programming right now, so if\nyou've got experience doing that, it'd be a big plus. We're particularly interested in\nsomeone who's got very deep Rails experience to serve as a sort of tech lead, but we\nhave many positions open for Rails people so if you'd be interested at all drop a line.<p>Product is looking to bring on people with some combination of travel industry\nknowledge and mobile applications to help get the company past maps and\ndirections. Most of our product people have development experience, so you'll be\nexpected to be able to \"talk shop\" with the engineers you work with, but your day-\nto-day responsibilities aren't going to be producing code as much as producing\nideas, pitching them to the rest of the company and helping the engineers and\ndesigners see them through to completion.<p>I can definitively say that MapQuest is among the best places I've ever worked. The\noffice space is fantastic (Downtown Denver right off the 16th Street Mall) and the\nnew management team is very serious about doing things right as we try to pivot\nthe company away from directions and into product development. The brand is\npractically a household name, the product team is happy to listen to engineers for\nfeedback or ideas, and we've got the interesting position right now of being able to\nwork like a startup except with a large pre-build audience (I've been told that we\nhad 40M UV's on a brand new product this past Thursday, for example). You can\nread the company postings here (<a href=\"http://company.mapquest.com/careers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://company.mapquest.com/careers/</a>) but I'd really enjoy being able to answer ?'s directly. My e-mail is in my profile and please\nfeel free to contact me personally if you have further ?'s, want to chat, or anything\nelse. Happy holidays, and hope to hear from some of you soon!","time":1354471156,"type":"comment"}
