We allow families to find trusted caregivers near them at half the cost of a traditional agency. It's a HUGE $80B market that's massively screwed up.<p>We’re growing crazy fast - we’ve done over $100,000 in care in under 4 months in our private beta. And everyone’s taking notice; we’ve been featured by top media outlets such as NBC, Wired magazine, Forbes, TechCrunch, VentureBeat and others.<p>We are profitable and have been generating revenue from day one (how many startups can say that out here?) We recently closed a round of seed financing of $1.3M to ramp up our growth. We're backed by 500 Startups.<p>We're hiring web and mobile developers. Here are the requirements:<p><pre><code>  * Ability to code FAST and pick up new stuff quickly\n\n  * Raw intelligence - kinda self explanatory\n\n  * Hunger - this isn’t a 9 to 5 job; we’re disrupting a $100B industry\n\n  * Determination - you will walk through walls to make shit happen\n\n  * Hacker mentality - are you good at hacking or reverse engineering systems?\n</code></pre>\nNice to Have<p><pre><code>  * RoR, git, heroku background\n\n  * JS background\n</code></pre>\nNot Required<p><pre><code>  * Any specific number of years of experience - you could be straight out of college or have 10 years of experience. We're open to both.\n\n  * Any specific language or platform knowledge\n\n</code></pre>\nTo apply, send an email to andy@tendertree.com with a short description of why you're interested in TenderTree.","time":1354415939,"type":"comment"}
