We work primarily in Scala and Ruby on top of Hadoop and Cascading. We have a strong culture of investing in developer tools and open sourcing them when they're ready: check out <a href=\"https://github.com/etsy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/etsy</a> for examples of what we're contributing to. It doesn't matter where you live, though being in the same time zone as the continental US would be an asset. Ping me at avi@etsy.com if you're interested.","time":1354388708,"type":"comment"}
