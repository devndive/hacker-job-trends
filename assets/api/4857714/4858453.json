You should have some front-end development experience with HTML/CSS (more skills are fine of course) and be prepared to learn the rest on the fly.<p>You will work primarily in PHP, HTML/CSS, and Javascript and our small team of 5 (all coding) will make sure you ramp quickly, ship public-facing features, and have a ton of fun doing it.  We have a track record of helping talented ambitious people get started as developers through our intern program and we love to coach, teach, and learn with you.<p>Our company makes it easy for individuals to express their expertise and make product recommendations, and when they generate online sales they get rewarded for it.  For businesses we provide simple tools for running a dead-simple Dropbox style referral program \"refer a friend and you each get $10\" through our API.  We graduated from YC this summer (2012).<p>We are happy to talk to more experienced engineers as well, but I'm putting this role out there front and center because I hope some inexperienced folks who might be daunted by the level of competition in the Bay Area will be excited that we are supportive of  their \"new-ness\" and send us a note.  You can apply by emailing jobs@refer.ly (goes to me, just helps to filter) with a bit more info about yourself.<p>You can see our full list of hiring needs here: <a href=\"http://refer.ly/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://refer.ly/jobs</a><p>Marketing Interns, iOS Developer, Web Developer, Senior Engineer (e.g. could manager entire engineering team)","time":1354385578,"type":"comment"}
