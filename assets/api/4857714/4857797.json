The idea is micropayments, but the twist is that you pay after you accumulate â‚¬5, rather than paying into a 'wallet' up front.<p>We have a couple of positions open for python developers, and as we are still very small, those positions have a lot of scope for responsibility and choosing your own focus. We have a lot of Django work, so there's also a possibility to join as a Django specialist, especially if you also grok HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Other technologies we use include Tornado, Cassandra, Redis, and our code lives on github. Experience with these is a bonus but not necessary!<p>If you are interested, drop us an email with a resume and some code to look at - jobs@laterpay.net","time":1354374442,"type":"comment"}
