(<a href=\"http://www.which.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.which.co.uk/</a>) - London, UK<p>At Which?, we believe that individuals can be as powerful as the organisations they have to deal with in their daily lives. We engage in advocacy campaigns on various consumer protection issues and aim to promote informed consumer choice in the purchase of goods and services, by testing products, highlighting inferior products or services, raising awareness of consumer rights and offering independent advice.<p>But for us, that's not enough. We want to look after consumers wherever and whenever they are to help them make the right decisions. So, we're currently revamping our digital presence by building a better infrastructure to support our products. As an example of what we've been up to, we recently launched <a href=\"http://university.which.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://university.which.co.uk</a> which is a new mobile-friendly website designed to help students make more informed decisions about their higher education choices.<p>The biggest challenge we face is designing and building a very broad range of other products in a more service-oriented and cross-platform manner. This will mean that there is a lot of starting from scratch, and having to decide upon the right tool for the right job (we're currently into Nodejs, Ruby, Java and PHP).<p>So if you are a great team player and you are into designing service oriented application, playing with large volume of data aggregation or you just love to solve challenging problems, we'd like to hear what you think. We are hiring front-end and back-end developers.<p>We're a diverse, sociable team, and you'll have the opportunity to make a big impact on the company and its future success.<p>Feel free to email us at recruitment@which.co.uk for more information.","time":1355142251,"type":"comment"}
