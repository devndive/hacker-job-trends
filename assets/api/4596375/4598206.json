You will be competing with Amazon, eBay, and Google - combined. We are inventing the future of e-commerce like no one else and have unchartered, tough problems to solve with a product that is already live.<p>You will be working with a resourceful team. A relentless hustler with vast connections and who makes incredible things happen, often. A CS PhD who has built large amounts of cool tech, does things with programs that even Lisp does not - and yet still needs help from you in this particular venture.<p>You are well rounded and frighteningly capable generalist that can tackle anything from Web design and frontend development, to Python on the backend and iOS if need be. We do have a preference for someone fantastic with computer vision, information retrieval, and/or NLP/data-mining, but we wouldn't prefer that over a record of building and releasing cool stuff.<p>This is an incredible opportunity to be apart of a team that never stops learning, building and iterating to conquer our goals. If you think you are the right fit email laurenashley707@gmail.com with any information you believe best indicates your ability (links to projects, GitHub profile, code samples, resume) but more importantly what is the most impressive thing you have built?","time":1349112135,"type":"comment"}
