Birchbox gives engineers freedom to innovate as we make awesome product discovery services for our customers.<p>The tech team at Birchbox is responsible for maintaining and improving the company's customer-facing site (<a href=\"http://birchbox.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://birchbox.com</a>), managing hosted and cloud infrastructure, and closely supporting other teams (logistics, marketing, et al.) in our 60+-person company. We work with a wide variety of open-source technologies: Debian-based servers; Chef deployments; Ruby on Rails and Java services; Python scripts; and PHP and Perl too. The size of our team and the breadth of its responsibilities means we rely on our engineers to be self-motivated and quickly follow through on tasks without requiring close supervision. In return our engineers are given leeway to use their own initiative.","time":1349101721,"type":"comment"}
