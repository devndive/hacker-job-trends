Our trainers are highly rated (no one with less that 4 star reviews so far) and we are building a growing but devoted user base. Almost 35% of our users who have worked out once, come back and workout again. However small right now, we generate revenue by taking a cut in the transaction :)<p>Our audience is elderly, new moms and business professionals who all have a high desire to get or be fit but dont find the time , find it too costly and do not have a regular regimen. With our technology and solution, they can.<p>Our stack is Django/MySQL. Our video is currently based on top of TokBox. We use Balanced(YC) for our payments since they are well suited for marketplaces like ours. We use Optimizely, MixPanel, Chartio to track our data and learn.<p>We are looking for a senior software engineer interested in backend and data analysis. We value curiosity, drive and passion over specific technology. However, if you have worked on Python or Video in the past that is a plus.<p>Email me at jobs@wello.co or check us out at <a href=\"http://www.wello.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.wello.co/</a>","time":1349198070,"type":"comment"}
