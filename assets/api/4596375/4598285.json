As far as we're concerned the stack is always in flux, we subscribe to no dogmas.<p>A full stack engineer would fit right in, and prior experience isn't a big deal: good hackers love learning new stuff (as do we, so we hope you can teach us awesome new things).<p>A designer with a UX background would also have major impact. Trying to represent the insane complexity around mapping disparate APIs is hard, but even more challenging is giving non-technical users the tools to do it.<p>We'd love to talk about the problems we're having, you can visit <a href=\"http://zapier.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://zapier.com/</a> and chat us up.","time":1349113011,"type":"comment"}
