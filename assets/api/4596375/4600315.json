They love it, use it every day and whisper sweet nothings to it at night. The problem is that over time when dealing with a large number of users and lots of Excel files, Excel becomes unmanageable, inefficient and eventually 'Excel Hell' takes over.<p>What invariably ends up happening is a big old-guard player comes in and convinces the company to get rid of Excel, getting them to use an Excel 'look and feel'. The problem is that it's not Excel - rather it's a crappy web grid that gives the company 10% of what Excel can do. This story has played out over and over again â€“ the customer buys the solution, ends up hating it and eventually moves back to using Excel.<p>At Vena we're coming at it from an entirely different angle: stay in Excel! We provide all the benefits of a big player solution while keeping the user in the one place they know and love: Excel.<p>We're a well funded company in full entrepreneurial growth mode looking to hire the best. If you want to work on something that great companies like McDonalds and Wells Fargo actually use then look no further than Vena Solutions.","time":1349142977,"type":"comment"}
