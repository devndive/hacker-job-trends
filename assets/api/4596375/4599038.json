That's a BIG challenge, and it requires a lot of NLP, search, code optimization, and other fun work.<p>Our website is currently ranked #46 in Quantcast's US rankings, and earlier this year we answered our 2 billionth question, so there's plenty of traffic &#38; data to keep us busy.<p>We do most of our work in Java, but we also use Groovy &#38; Grails, Rails, and a handful of other tools.  Data-wise we use MySQL and Cassandra for OLTP, and primarily Hadoop &#38; HBase for OLAP.  We deploy to CentOS, and use git for SCM.  We use a Kanban SDLC.<p>We have a very collaborative open office environment in an open-air mall with easy access to places like Whole Foods, Starbucks, and a number of great restaurants.  Company lounge with an xbox, regular \"office olympics\", and plenty of other perks as well.<p>If you're interested in seeing our open positions, head over to <a href=\"http://chacha.myexacthire.com/searchjobs.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://chacha.myexacthire.com/searchjobs.php</a>","time":1349121451,"type":"comment"}
