Our beta (Travtar.com) is live and I hope that you will poke around and have a look.<p>Right now we are looking to expand our (tiny) team to a Tech Lead (with the possibility of eventually assuming the CTO role). Although it would be good to have someone who knows Python/Django and machine learning/algorithms, it is more important to us to find someone who is a fast learner and a problem solver. Compensation will be equity.<p>We are also looking for a UX Intern to work closely with our Lead Designer.<p>If you're interested, contact hr [at] travtar [dot] com.","time":1338581876,"type":"comment"}
