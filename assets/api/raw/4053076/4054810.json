OCaml, a statically typed functional programming with similarities to Haskell, Scheme, Erlang, F# and  SML, is our language of choice. We've got the largest team of OCaml developers in any industrial setting, and probably the world's largest OCaml codebase. We use OCaml for running our entire business,  supporting everything from research to systems administration to trading systems. If you're interested in seeing how functional programming plays out in the real world, there's no better place.<p>The atmosphere is informal and intellectual. There is a focus on education, and people learn about software and trading, both through formal classes and on the job. The work is challenging, and you get to see the practical impact of your efforts in quick and dramatic terms. Jane Street is also small enough that people have the freedom to get involved in many different areas of the business. Compensation is highly competitive, and there's a lot of room for growth.<p>Apply here: <a href=\"http://janestreet.com/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://janestreet.com/apply</a>","time":1338574800,"type":"comment"}
