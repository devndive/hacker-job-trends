We're looking for backend and UI developers and a whole bunch of other positions as well.  The jobs page is at <a href=\"http://tidemark.net/company/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://tidemark.net/company/careers</a>.  The company is well-funded but it's still in the very early growth phase.<p>Tidemark is building a cloud-based business analytics system, which is way more interesting than it might sound.<p>We've had a particularly difficult time finding good UI developers.  Our UI is web-based but we initially focused on the iPad as our primary platform.  Now we're generalizing the UI for laptop and desktop use.  We're using Sencha Touch for iPad and Ext-4 for the other platforms, and most of our client code is in CoffeeScript.  We're really pushing the frameworks beyond what they were intended to do, so we're looking for people who know really know the ins and outs of developing rich UIs with JavaScript/CoffeeScript, the HTML DOM, and CSS.<p>If this sounds interesting, my email is on my profile page.","time":1338564340,"type":"comment"}
