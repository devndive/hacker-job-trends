(H1B okay)<p>We're building conversion tracking for social media -- \"SendGrid for sharing\", if you like.<p>Most sites and apps are currently doing a really poor job of measuring where social traffic comes from, and how valuable it is in terms of page views, signups and sales. We save people from reinventing the wheel by providing a set of APIs to integrate into their application that make it easy to generate shares and track the performance of different networks and campaigns. The APIs are written in Ruby and PHP right now, sitting on top of a mixture of MySQL and Redis, but we are pretty language-agnostic and pick the right tool for the job. The back-end challenges are all about taking lots of data and processing it scalably, as fast as possible.<p>We also have a GUI, a modern Javascript single-page app written using Backbone that sits on top of our APIs. It's all about allowing custmers to explore their data and find what's important.<p><a href=\"http://totally.awe.sm/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://totally.awe.sm/jobs</a><p>We're currently 13 people, with a goal of 14-16, of which 8 will be engineers.

If that makes you say \"yay!\" then you will definitely fit in.","time":1338567975,"type":"comment"}
