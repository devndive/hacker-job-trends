Our customers are top 5 web properties and fortune 50 enterprises who want something that works like AWS S3 / Rackspace Cloud Files -- but provide it as an in-house offering. SwiftStack provides a distribution of OpenStack Swift and controller software to manage a deployment.<p>We are looking for engineers at all levels of the 'stack'. Python is the lingua-franca. Our management controller uses django, zeromq, graphite and all the math required to run a distributed storage system. To build the runtime component we are well versed in linux tuning, systems programming, load balancing, authentication, and filesystems.<p>We're big contributors to open source. Not just in OpenStack, but also the tools we use to deliver our product.
