Help us scale and meet demand for real-time location-aware planning. Our focus is on groups and events (\"spur of the moment, on the fly\"). We've launched the first version of our iOS app and are working on a web and Android version.<p>The founders are straight shooters who value clear communication and getting stuff done. We're obssessed with creating a product that fills what we see as a major hole in social networking software -- helping people more efficiently connect in real-life with close networks so they can spend more of their time building and enriching real relationships.<p>Technologies:<p><pre><code>    • frontend: coffeescript, jQuery, backbone.js, socket.io, compass\n\n    • backend: python, django, gevent, gunicorn, nginx, postgresql\n</code></pre>\nImmediate front-end needs include many web design tasks and coffeescript/js templates for our single-page architecture web site. We're also on the lookout for a good mobile app designer to help us design our first Android release and update our iOS app UI as we gather feedback from users.<p>Support what's going to potentially be a wild ride as we do launch events over the next few months.<p>gmail - davidmarble (main tech guy on the founding team)","time":1338563940,"type":"comment"}
