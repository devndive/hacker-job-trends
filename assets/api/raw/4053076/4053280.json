Make it easier to do trade across borders. Setting up a production line and looking for a valve supplier that won't flake out on you? Use us to search for suppliers (or buyers) of any goods that go into or out of US ports and see credit reports, corporate responsibility audits, and customs records. Then, use us to reach out to them, communicate, and close the deal.<p>We're looking for exceptional software designers and engineers who can solve hard problems and design beautiful systems for our users. As a designer, you'll need experience both sketching out concepts and building them. As an engineer, you'll need experience with full-stack web application development, both server-side and client-side: A given day’s checkins may include performance tweaks to our backend data processing pipeline, an updated multivariate landing page test, a parsing expression grammar for a new data source, upgrades to our deployment infrastructure to make better use of our CDN, or new parallelizing queries to make Panjiva search faster. We're growing quickly, so our ideal candidates are ready to grow and learn just as fast in order to take the lead on critical projects.<p>We work in ruby on rails, but will teach you if you're coming from another platform.<p>If you're interested, email me at andrew@panjiva with your resume and a link to something cool that you've made.","time":1338557904,"type":"comment"}
