Close your eyes and imagine your favourite memory - say christmas morning as a kid. You’re probably not thinking of a rectangle in a void (i.e. a picture), nor are you thinking of a moving rectangle in a void (i.e. a movie), you’re probably thinking of an entire world that you’re standing in the center of. We make an IOS app that allows you to save this entire moment into a seamless spherical photograph called a bubble that you can save and share with others.<p>We’re a small, three person team - the intern who made Yelp’s Monocle, a designer from Cooper Union and a computer vision genius. We raised $2 million in a heavily oversubscribed round of funding from August Capital. We spoke at TED (sorry, no video!), have offices on union square in San Francisco and have an app that has an unparalleled ability to induce uncontrolled smiles of glee when people first see it.<p>We’re looking for someone to be our point person for IOS development. We actually all have IOS experience (and really cool app in progress), but we’re looking for someone to grab the bull by the horns and focus on IOS full time (as the two engineers are focused on computer vision and ‘all the other boring engineering’ respectively). You’ll be a pretty big deal at our company. We’re pretty lucky in that our technology spans everywhere from advanced computer vision to WebGL and HTML5 to Python, PostgreSQL and Memcached to low-level run-loop optimizations for UI responsiveness and Core Animation magic.  It's a lot of fun.<p>Send me an e-mail at ben@bubb.li","time":1338586476,"type":"comment"}
