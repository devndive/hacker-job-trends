We have specific openings listed on our jobs page [1], but are always looking for great engineers of all sorts, and can sponsor H1B visas if needed. We're located in downtown Palo Alto, just a short distance from Stanford University and Caltrain. IMHO we have an ambitious, clear vision that we have been executing against since the beginning, and we have an amazing, diverse, honest and passionate team. Not a day goes by that I don't learn here -- it's really an amazing place to work.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://flipboard.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://flipboard.com</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://hire.jobvite.com/CompanyJobs/Careers.aspx?c=qB89Vfwx&#38;s=Indeed&#38;page=Jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hire.jobvite.com/CompanyJobs/Careers.aspx?c=qB89Vfwx&...</a>","time":1338568850,"type":"comment"}
