We’re backed by Mantella Venture Partners and are seeing great early traction. We have a solid team so far and need someone to help make up the foundation of the company as we grow.\nWe’re looking for a developer with some Python and Django chops who isn’t afraid to pick up new skills when needed (we use CoffeeScript and SASS, for example). We’re looking for someone self-taught, though we won’t hold it against you if you’ve also been to school.\nEmail us at aron@shopcastr.com with whatever you think we need to see before following up with you.","time":1338583294,"type":"comment"}
