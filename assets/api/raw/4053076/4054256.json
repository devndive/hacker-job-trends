Think HTTP/DB/memcache/NAS/etc processing times for all the servers in a datacenter, all by passively watching the network.<p>I'm a software engineer at ExtraHop and here's why I love my job:<p>1. The team is amazing and everyone makes a difference. The two founders, Jesse and Raja, designed and built BigIP v9 when they were at F5 Networks before founding ExtraHop, and are still very much involved in engineering. It's a great working environment and we have a lot of fun.<p>2. Hard problems at all levels.  We parse a bunch of different protocols at 10Gbps by writing high-performance multithreaded C and our own linux kernel drivers.  Our datastore handles 200,000 inserts a second with 10MB/s of data.  Our UI has a ton of charts and tables, with data going through django and tornado.  We use python, C, javascript, flex (slowly moving to a new UI with html5 + javascript), and a modified yacc+bison for some of our protocol parsers. You can hack anything from C to the front-end design and anywhere in between.<p>3. Our customers love it.  It's awesome to see problems diagnosed and solved with our box.<p>jobs@extrahop.com<p><a href=\"http://www.extrahop.com/company/jobs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.extrahop.com/company/jobs/</a>","time":1338567724,"type":"comment"}
