Current market solutions are broken and tedious and we're building a way for people to be healthy and achieve their goals without preventing people from living their normal\nday-to-day lives.<p>We are an engineering driven company of 5 who are very product driven and love building things that solve peoples' problems. Our stack is Python (Flask) and MongoDB on the backend and we use a modern combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend. People who have portfolios, interesting projects, or funny little hacks will be noticed the most.<p>Contact us via chris at nutrivise.com!","time":1338572162,"type":"comment"}
