The BloomReach Tech-Services team has a Dallas spot open for an engineer. If you love to get your hands dirty with the connective bits to enable customer integrations, webscraping, and data analysis, give me a ping (I’m on this team).<p>BloomReach is a product and engineering driven company, headquartered in Mountain View, CA, with a Dallas office of ~20 people just north of downtown. We&#x27;re walking distance to Mavs games (sup Dirk). We opened up shop here ~2 years ago. Most of our products revolve around search, analytics, personalization, and content management and power many of the biggest brands online.<p>I’ve been part of the company for 2 of it&#x27;s 9 years and it has easily been the best step of my career. We’re in an interesting place where a lot of our customers are pivoting from their cumbersome and clunky solutions and they find us. We have two facets to our product geode, Content and Commerce --- and for what its worth, both products are well-placed in Gartner’s 2018 magic quadrant for their respective categories.<p>Our founder and CEO, Raj, built the company with a goal to make BloomReach the most impactful professional experience of each employee’s career. This describes me. You’re going to be hard pressed to find a better place to work in Dallas for software eng.<p>And if you’re not the engineer type, we also have Solution Architect, Senior PM, Senior Sales Analyst, and Sales Development Rep positions open in Dallas too (message me joey.liechty@bloomreach.com).","time":1520612656,"type":"comment"}
