Over the past couple of years, we&#x27;ve worked hard to migrate our entire web application stack to Node and powerful client-side apps and we&#x27;re looking to turn the dial towards product experimentation and innovation. We need your engineering ability and your desire to be a part of the whole product!<p>I’m a manager on the Online Checkout (that’s the “Pay with PayPal” button and experience) engineering team. We&#x27;re looking for experienced JavaScript developers. My team is currently working primarily with Angular on the client and Express&#x2F;Kraken on Node. If you&#x27;ve got experience with GraphQL or React, we&#x27;re actively exploring doing an inside-out migration of our application and could use your expertise. As most Node shops go, we&#x27;re leveraging a whole lot of other open source tools as well and we&#x27;re very supportive of open source activities for our people.<p>Likewise -- there&#x27;s a large demand for API focused Java engineers to help with our payment services that serve over $100+B in payments across 200+ countries. The PayPal Platform is a suite of web services, which are used by internal and external developers to enable payments anytime, anywhere and anyway. The Platform processes billions of requests each month, and enables PayPal and its partners to rapidly innovate on new payment scenarios and enable new experiences. Therefore, the evolution of the Platform is integral to PayPal’s long-term strategy.<p>As an engineer in our development team you will be responsible for the development and delivery of the web services supporting PayPal APIs and user experiences on various channels (web, mobile, etc.), as well as integrations with partners. You will work closely with product and experience and&#x2F;or integration teams to understand the developer needs and deliver the APIs that meets their needs.<p>JavaScript &#x2F; Node JS Application Engineers: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobsearch.paypal-corp.com&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;job&#x2F;node-js-software-engineer&#x2F;J3Q65X6LLXD4F2W30P3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobsearch.paypal-corp.com&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;job&#x2F;node-js-software...</a>\nJava API Engineers: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobsearch.paypal-corp.com&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;job&#x2F;senior-checkout-api-developer&#x2F;J3T4PF64Y6XWPCR74FV\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobsearch.paypal-corp.com&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;job&#x2F;senior-checkout-...</a><p>We have several openings within my team as well as within other teams--so drop me a line even if my particular opening doesn&#x27;t sound interesting and I&#x27;ll help you find the right place!
