General Interview Process -&gt; Hackerrank test, call with the recruiter, phone interview, onsite interviews I work at Booking.com, which is a world leader in travel accommodations, as a backend developer. I have only positive things to say about working here. The people are intelligent and helpful, interesting problems to solve and the work hours are unbelievably sane. The company is strongly data driven and very dynamic, which was one of its biggest charms for me. Amsterdam is not a bad place to be either :) The Dutch government also gives a tax break through the 30% ruling to non-dutch people.\nThe work environment is very international and everybody speaks fluent English. The relocation process is also very finely tuned through years of experience of doing this. If you have any other questions about the company or the hiring process or you would like me to refer you, please feel free to send me an email at siddharthsarda01 at gmail.com (Email also in my profile at Hacker news).<p>To have an idea of the kind of problems being solved here, you can also look at our dev blog:<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.booking.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.booking.com&#x2F;</a><p>We are hiring for our headquarters office in Amsterdam:<p>- Backend developers - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;g5n6oe\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;g5n6oe</a><p>- Software Developer and Team Lead - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;1pc5ot1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;1pc5ot1</a><p>- Senior Software Developer - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;a7xd1v1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;a7xd1v1</a><p>- Senior Java Developer - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;r26qig1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;r26qig1</a><p>- Senior Software Developer(Technical lead) - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;qin6c01\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;qin6c01</a><p>- Client Side Developers and Team Lead - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;r64fyd1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;r64fyd1</a><p>- Full stack developer and Team lead - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;367plc1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;367plc1</a><p>- Full Stack developer, Tel Aviv - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;hymg7n1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;hymg7n1</a><p>- Data analysts - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;al15kt\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;al15kt</a><p>- Data Scientist(Machine Learning) - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;5uxtdv\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;5uxtdv</a><p>- UX Designer - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;e23axu\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;e23axu</a>","time":1519922750,"type":"comment"}
