The role will be implementing and honing testing and continuous deployment of our blockchain node (Burrow), encryption services, and smart contract middleware. We need to blend existing distributed technologies with newer decentralised ones in a principled way and have the ability to recover gracefully from failures. Considering the ambient security environment and what falls through the cracks between systems will be essential.<p>You would work with our technical CEO who has developed much of our existing deployment and our CTO as part of the platform team. Most of our code is written in Go, Solidity, and JavaScript. We will deploy GCE, AWS, OpenShift, bare metal data centres, and personal servers. Our technical work interacts with economics and law in a way we think is very interesting. Join us.<p>We have workspace in Edinburgh and East London.
