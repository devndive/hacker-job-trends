Unlike a typical loan which is one check one time, a construction loan has several monthly disbursements over the course of the project. This process is currently managed with excel, PDFs, and emails. We have a web-based platform that makes this process much easier, faster, and less error-prone. It’s more exciting than it sounds, I promise.<p>We value mastery, transparency, and, most of all, getting things done.<p>We offer competitive pay and benefits, plus equity. Despite being a startup, we do value work&#x2F;life balance. We’re still small (4 full-time developers, 6 full-time employees total), so there’s a lot of opportunity to set the tone and direction of the company.
