Their current workflow is stuck in 1999: No source control, tedious manual deployments, no roll back. We&#x27;ve built a hosted service with automatic source control that  &quot;just works&quot;, and modern tools to review and deploy updates. We are in a growing, opportunity-rich enterprise market: For every $1 paid to Salesforce, $3 more are spent on customizing it.<p>So far we have hired slowly because we believe in maintaining high-revenue per employee. We admire companies like Basecamp, Mailchimp and Atlassian. We are funded by customer revenue and Indie.vc.<p>Our stack is primarily Python and Go (Node.js developers interested in learning Go should also apply). Youâ€™ll get to work directly with the CTO on important technology decisions.<p>Email team@bluecanvas.io if you&#x27;re interested. No recruiters please.","time":1519935997,"type":"comment"}
