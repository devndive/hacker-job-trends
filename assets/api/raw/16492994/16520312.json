This may sound simple but it is not. We are looking for someone to primarily work on our analysis engine.<p>If you want to dig in and work with smart people to solve hard problems and have fun along the way - you might be the one we are looking for. Example of a hard problem: figuring out how to detect Spectre in customer codebases. Examples of fun: team outings, hackathons, gaming Fridays.<p>The current challenge in this team’s hands is to modernize their static code analysis toolchain to make sure more critical issues in customer code don’t make it into production. We need someone with recent experience eating, sleeping and breathing C++ and who considers Java a rapid-app-development language.<p>Our office in Canada is in Kanata, 20 minutes from downtown. Barbeque weekends in summer, all you can drink coffee and soft drinks, fruits on Mondays, muffins on Fridays, bagels and cream cheese 24&#x2F;7. Free parking, nice and challenging jogging route nearby and showers on site :) And of course, awesome work laptop provided.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, please drop us an e-mail @ hedvi.kink@roguewave.com.","time":1520249380,"type":"comment"}
