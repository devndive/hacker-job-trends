In 5–10 years time people will look back and think it’s crazy how we approached health. People find it very difficult to get a grip on what’s going on inside, and this leads to big problems later on as our lifestyles catch up with us. Thriva is going to be the one to change that, hopefully with your help!<p>We&#x27;re looking for engineers to join our team of 13 and help build a world class product. We want someone willing to jump in anywhere in the stack but solid experience with Ruby is a good positive.
