We launched last year and have grown to over 2 million users per month and we&#x27;re now hiring our first employee!<p>We&#x27;re looking for smart people who love writing code and share our passion for open knowledge.  Some cool things we&#x27;re doing: designing an ultra-user-friendly publishing web app, mining data from academic papers with ML, implementing new ranking algorithms for authors and journals. Our main product runs on Django but we&#x27;re pretty language&#x2F;framework agnostic. We are currently focused on the Indonesian market but have plans to expand.<p>Compensation would be a combination of salary and equity, with a significant equity component. You&#x27;ll be joining us at ground zero with plenty of freedom and opportunity for personal growth.<p>Contact email in my profile.
