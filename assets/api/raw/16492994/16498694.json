We take pride in the fact that weâ€™re working on one of the most pressing problems in our society: ensuring that our seniors are taken care of despite seemingly endless challenges caused by fiscal and labor shortages.<p>We just closed a Series A in January 2018, and have raised a total of $9.5m to date.
