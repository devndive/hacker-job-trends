We believe our motion tracking technology will fundamentally change how we interact with machines. Our first product is the Intelligent Spatial Sensing “Rover” Module and 6DoF Controller for VR&#x2F;AR devices.<p>We are looking for :<p>a. Computer Vision &#x2F; Machine Intelligence Engineers<p><pre><code>   * SLAM implementation experience is a plus\n\n   * Deep understanding of Tensorflow is desirable \n</code></pre>\nb. Embedded (DSP &#x2F; VLIW) Engineers -<p><pre><code>   * Board Bringup and Device driver experience\n\n   * Machine Learning on DSPs or Microcontrollers \n\n   * Movidius Myriad &#x2F; Qualcomm Hexagon knowledge desirable\n</code></pre>\n<i>You</i>: Self starter and mostly importantly a finisher - pick something up and deliver without supervision. You will be a manager with a team size of one - you. You will need to pick the next problem on the way to achieve our goals and solve it. You will need to hold a lot of complexity in your head and have solid CS fundamentals. For what we do, Google may not have all the answers to your questions, github may not have any such sample code and Stackoverflow may have a vaguely related question with no replies, but you will be responsible for solving the problem. Everyone of us is a hands on engineer \nso you will thrive doing more of what you love.<p>Drop us an email at stdin@nod-labs.com","time":1520228013,"type":"comment"}
