The first few hours are critical during a disaster for first responders but they’re also full of confusion with conflicting damage reports and out of date satellite maps. We provide a geospatial intelligence platform and drone fleet management solution that enables first responders to quickly launch drones at a disaster site and get a detailed survey over hundreds of acres in minutes.<p>We’re a small team of ex-Stanford, ex-Google, ex-vmware engineers with experience delivering products to large government customers. We’re primarily looking for full-stack engineers but also computer vision experts and anyone interested in making an impact.<p>Contact us at: careers@aerie-tech.com","time":1519926991,"type":"comment"}
