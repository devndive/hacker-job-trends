React experience and strong holistic design thinking are the only requirements, although weâ€™re especially interested in working with people who are interested in designing for accessibility or disadvantaged communities. The project itself is a web application (not a marketing site) that will have be used by people who are looking for jobs. We are big on cultivating agency and helping people align with their values, so that will be a theme of our thinking and work.<p>We are thinking about this as a product residency where you will work and think with us at our office, fit into our product development process, and be supported completely through the project.<p>Please email me at chris at underdog.io if you&#x27;re interested in finding out more.","time":1519923462,"type":"comment"}
