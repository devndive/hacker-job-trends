You’ll be building APIs, creating reusable components, and working with your colleagues to make iterative improvements.<p>* Our open source web application framework for developing information rich applications extends from a low level search engine up to high level UI components, along with everything in the middle.<p>* Our work is a bit different. We went to the effort of developing our own platform because nothing else could do what we needed. Before it was fashionable, we moved away from the relational model and built server side JavaScript APIs. Our platform is mature and incredibly effective at building applications to manage semi-structured information — and easy to extend and evolve to handle new requirements.<p>* You’ll be a leading voice in shaping our development practises. We build highly customised applications with lots of business logic on top of integrated products, and our API design and development processes must enable this to be maintainable and sustainable in the long term.<p>* We care about quality and doing things right. We know that doing things well means we can move faster, and so have minimal technical debt and legacy code. You’ll be making improvements and driving us forward, supported by a leadership team who will reduce scope, not quality.<p>* It’s an exciting time to join. We’re market leaders in our niche, and expanding out into related products. You’ll have the excitement of building new things, within the stability of a company with a proven business and enviable reputation.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.haplo-services.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;senior-developer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.haplo-services.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;senior-developer</a>","time":1519934349,"type":"comment"}
