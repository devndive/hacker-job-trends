As a programmer, you spend hours every day trying to answer simple questions with outdated, single-player tools that force you to constantly context-switch away from your code. Sourcegraph gives development teams lightning-fast code search across all their code along with full code intelligence (jump-to-def, mouse-over docs, find-refs, etc.) in an easy-to-use web app.<p>We&#x27;re a small team founded by Stanford and Palantir alumni. Our users and customers span programmers across the world, influential open-source authors, and companies large and small.
