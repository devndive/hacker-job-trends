We’re looking for Employee #1: a developer with good communications skills to help people build awesome things with Anvil.<p>HN called us “amazing”, “just what we need, in the language we need”, and “really really cool”. Our customers range from individuals to growing startups to huge tech companies, and they say the same. Check out our six-minute demo; I promise you it’s worth it: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anvil.works&#x2F;#about\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anvil.works&#x2F;#about</a><p>You’ll be building example applications, writing tutorials, and helping our users build their apps. You don’t need to be a Python expert already, but you will be pretty soon: most of the code you write will be read by someone working out how to do what you’re doing! Don’t worry - you’ll have the Anvil authors themselves to get you up to speed. Joining a startup this early means you can help shape who we are, as well as who you are in the company. You&#x27;ll also be shaping how everyone uses a shiny new development tool. We’re friendly, open, and have good work-life balance - and we want to stay that way. Come join in!<p>My email is in my profile, or you can drop us a line at recruitment@anvil.works.","time":1519926364,"type":"comment"}
