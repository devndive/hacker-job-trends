Look at the startups hiring on this thread, and imagine running the security team for, like, a bunch of them simultaneously. That’s what we’re about. You’d want to be interested in that problem to make reading further worth your time.<p>We’re currently 6 security-researcher software-developers. We find groups of startups with similar technical security challenges, and then automate and systematize. Everything that’s fun about application security — crawling through the ventilation ducts of software skyscrapers like John McClane, being a scary story told to baby software developers to keep them up at night — is fun about what we do. Mix in blue-team tooling, and that’s where we are.<p>We’re hiring our first non-partner employee. Salaried, with benefits. Requirements: extremely interested in security, can code well in some language, willing to read and code in any language. Offices in Chicago and NYC (WFH fine, but we need to see you regularly).<p>What we cannot promise: a clear job description, a refined hiring process. We’re figuring that stuff out now.<p>What we can promise: honest and direct answers to serious inquiries regardless of your experience or perceived skill level.<p>jobs@latacora.com<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latacora.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latacora.com</a>","time":1519950247,"type":"comment"}
