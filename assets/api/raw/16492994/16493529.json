Aging is the single greatest risk factor for the most detrimental diseases on Earth — by understanding and treating the biological damage accumulated as we age, we can find powerful new therapies for fighting disease and living healthier, longer lives.<p>(For newcomers: over the past few decades an unignorable amount of evidence has piled up from the best labs in the world that this is possible[1].)<p>We’re using machine learning to speed up experimentation in a field that has historically struggled to experiment quickly. Here’s more on our mission and approach: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;spring-discovery&#x2F;accelerating-the-discovery-of-therapies-for-aging-and-its-related-diseases-7c6a2109189f\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;spring-discovery&#x2F;accelerating-the-discove...</a><p>We just raised a 4.25M seed from General Catalyst, First Round, Sam Altman, Laura Deming, and more[2]. We’ve got a team of leading aging biologists working closely w&#x2F; machine learning folks, and we’re hiring a pragmatic data scientist to round out our early team.
