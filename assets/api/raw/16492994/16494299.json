We got started as an equipment rental marketplace where contractors can lend out their underused equipment. Last year we launched a mixed fleet telematics service to tap into machines&#x27; engine data and provide insights to companies about how their assets are used and maintained, and to predict when they are about to break down.<p>We value transparency, trust, short feedback cycles, minimizing WIP, and blameless problem solving. Our current tech stack is Python, React, React Native, Angular (legacy), Postgres, AWS, Docker, and Jasper.<p>If that sounds interesting, please check out our job postings for more details.
