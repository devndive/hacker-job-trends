I like the product, I like my team, I like the culture. I also never feel like I&#x27;m the smartest guy in the room.<p>Our product is basically computer management&#x2F;security for government and large enterprises, but the special part is that it&#x27;s fast - even when working with a more than a million computers. Our customers love it.<p>We&#x27;re hiring for all kinds of roles, but the ones I&#x27;m most familiar with are Product Engineering and Technical Account Managers (TAM).<p>I&#x27;m on Product Engineering; the core is mostly C++, and then JavaScript for the modules and admin interface (AngularJS&#x2F;Node.js - we&#x27;ll probably upgrade from AngularJS to something newer eventually, but it works for now). There&#x27;s also small but growing amounts of Rust and Python.<p>TAMs make up the largest portion of our ~650 people, and are a big part of why customers love us. Most of our TAMs have a technical background: sysadmin, ops, programming, etc. There&#x27;s also a fair amount of switching between TAM and Product Engineering.<p>The pay range above is just what I was told for my particular role; I actually pushed them a little higher, so it&#x27;s definitely not a hard upper limit. The bonuses are also incredible - approaching fintech levels.<p>Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site]","time":1520461376,"type":"comment"}
