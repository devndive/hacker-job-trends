We are rapidly taking on new clients while maintaining current projects, and we are looking for a creative, experienced, multi-talented developer to further scale. We ship features weekly on a variety of projects and iterate and refine often, so the ideal candidate will be quick on their feet in a brainstorm, write extensible clean code, and communicate very well -- we have our own development frameworks that change as product needs evolve so interfacing well with us is an absolute must.<p>You will first be hired on a contract basis for a specific project. If we work well together there is opportunity for more down the road. We generate A LOT of work and can offer varied and exciting problem solving opportunities (think 2-5 simultaneous startup ideas) as time goes on -- Prontotype deals with new ideas almost every day! There is also a possibility for equity in some of our projects down the road depending on how things go.<p>Send inquiries to jobs@prontotype.us and tell us about yourself. Please include links or a portfolio of projects you have worked on (we are most impressed with apps you have shipped now on the App Store, frameworks you have made, pet projects you are proud of... things that show what you love to build!).","time":1398990262,"type":"comment"}
