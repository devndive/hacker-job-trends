We value functional programming, distributed systems, fault tolerance and high availability, backed by all kinds of languages and persistence schemes. We are serious about scala, erlang&#x2F;elixir, ruby, node, and store stuff in SQL, nosql, and sometimes in plain old files.<p>Our culture is one of uncompromising transparency and GSD (the good kind of GSD, where anything that blocks us from getting stuff done is prioritized). We value risk taking, learning from failure, provide superb compensation and benefits, as well as having a laid back office culture (I personally practice Hammock Driven Development fairly regularly).\nFeel free to apply via the web site, and let us know hacker news sent you, or contact me directly (phamilton at brightroll dot com).
