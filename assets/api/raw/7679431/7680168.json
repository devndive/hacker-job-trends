Every month millions of EasyPost packages are delivered across the world. By tying together disparate data sources and APIs we&#x27;ve created a scalable shipping API for developers everywhere.<p>This is just the beginning of the beginning. Imagine if shipping worked like all our other web services. You have a smartphone, why do you need to go to a store to ship something? Why do you need to wait at home for a package? Because no single platform has tied together all these pieces of the transaction yet.<p>We&#x27;re excited about solving interesting problems alongside great people. We&#x27;d love to have you along for the ride.<p>Positions:<p>Backend - Ruby&#x2F;Rails (not a requirement, many of us are new to it and we&#x27;ll eventually migrate away), MySQL, Softlayer - Rates, Tracking, Batch jobs, adding carriers, and other API improvements.<p>Frontend - Ruby&#x2F;Rails, JS, CSS - Dashboard improvements, visualizations, site redesign.<p>Apply at: <a href=\"https://www.easypost.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.easypost.com&#x2F;jobs</a>","time":1398956613,"type":"comment"}
