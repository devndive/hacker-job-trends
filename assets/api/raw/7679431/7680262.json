We have been in business since 2004 and many thousands of teams, both small and large, use our products.<p>We are hiring for different positions, but our main focus right now is on hiring a technical support engineer to help us support our TestRail customers. This is not a typical support role though, as our products and customers are very technical (they are software dev&#x2F;testing teams), so it&#x27;s an interesting and challenging position.<p>As most of our customers are from the US, Canada or other non-German speaking countries, excellent English writing and communication skills are critical for this role (German not required). You can learn more about the Support Engineer role here:<p><a href=\"http://www.gurock.com/about/jobs/support-engineer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gurock.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;support-engineer&#x2F;</a><p>We have recently opened a nice office in Berlin (Prenzlauer Berg, near Mitte) and offer great benefits. We use a modern web development stack with PHP, an advanced custom MVC framework (like Rails), Vagrant etc. We provide a very productive and flexible working environment.<p>If you are in Berlin (or plan to move to Berlin soon) and one of our open positions sounds like a good fit, let me know.","time":1398957404,"type":"comment"}
