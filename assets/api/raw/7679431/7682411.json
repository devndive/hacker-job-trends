If you wanna look me up on the twitters I can be found @jcolebrand and can give more details after you look around our site. I can buy you a beer at the Gingerman or something and we can discuss what&#x27;s up.<p>Stacks: MSSQL, ASP.NET MVC+Razor, iOS (mostly wrapped), Android. All the good stuff. VS2012&#x2F;VS2013, etc.<p>Bonus: Daily catered in lunch, MacBook Pros for devs (or an Origin laptop which is a tad beefier if you just can&#x27;t handle OSX), Herman Miller Aerons, etc.<p>What the hell do we do? We write online banking software for credit unions. Think: really fancy reporting app, as we don&#x27;t manage the pennies, we just show transactions and do rollup reporting.<p>Seriously tho, if you&#x27;re devops, and in the Plano&#x2F;Frisco or commuting area, we&#x27;re in need!! :D","time":1398974855,"type":"comment"}
