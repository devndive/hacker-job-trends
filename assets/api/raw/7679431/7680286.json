Having a need to find people to buy our designs, we turned to social media. It ended up being a great customer acquisition channel. We turned that into a service that can be used by startups and small businesses.<p>About you:<p>You love growth hacking, working your way around system limits, analyzing social media data, jamming out to your favorite tunes, and hugs (lots of hugs.) Oh, you probably should be a product designer (visual&#x2F;ux) or a developer (iOS&#x2F;Android&#x2F;Rails)<p>What a typical day looks like:<p>Hanging out with DJs and musicians that come by for customer development. Startups come by too, but it&#x27;s much more fun having impromptu dance parties with emerging artists ;) You&#x27;ll probably dance while you code too. We love life and enjoy every moment of it. Our company motto: We live to fight another day!<p>How to apply:<p>You&#x27;ll figure out a way to find me or <a href=\"http://www.goodaudience.com/contact\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodaudience.com&#x2F;contact</a>","time":1398957604,"type":"comment"}
