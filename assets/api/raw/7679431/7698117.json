Full-time. <a href=\"http://ginkgobioworks.com/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ginkgobioworks.com&#x2F;careers</a><p>Ginkgo BioWorks is a young company out of MIT with the mission of making biology easier to engineer. We engineer organisms to address fundamental challenges the world is facing today. We aren&#x27;t trying to study biology, we are trying to build it - constructing, editing, and redesigning the living world. Our bioengineers make use of an in-house pipeline of synthetic biology technologies to design and build new organisms.<p>You will be working closely with our biological engineers to design and implement our computer aided design and manufacturing (CAD&#x2F;CAM) platform. Work includes programming robots to build metabolic pathways and new genomes, automate measurement processes, and implementing gene and pathway design algorithms. You don&#x27;t need previous biology experience; Ginkgo is a great environment for amazing programmers to learn to hack biology.<p>Ginkgo&#x27;s programming languages of choice are Ruby, Python, and DNA, but you must be someone who loves writing elegant code in any language. Most importantly, you should be passionate about making biology the next engineering discipline, and learning new things.<p>Interested?
