We&#x27;re also going to disrupt the stock photography industry. We&#x27;ve just signed a lease on a new (awesome) office space near Carol Shelby&#x27;s old HQ in Marina del Rey, and should be moving there from our current space in Santa Monica in June or July.<p>Full-Stack Engineers (Mid- and Senior-Level Engineers)\nOur stack is Rails, but we&#x27;re open to Java or Python engineers who want to learn Ruby as well. We&#x27;re going to be building a web application and a number of RESTful API&#x27;s for partner sales as well. It&#x27;s exciting stuff!<p>Search Engineer\nWe want to use ElasticSearch - anyone who has experience with scaling ElasticSearch is welcome to apply. If you also have experience with application development (in nearly any language), we&#x27;d especially love to chat with you.<p>Designer\nWe&#x27;re hunting a designer who knows HTML and CSS. Strong Adobe CS knowledge is required as well. Applicants should have experience with interaction design and a strong understanding of flows and patterns. Experience designing for mobile-first and implementing front-end frameworks like bootstrap is a must.<p>I can tell you a lot more on the phone or via email. I&#x27;m the internal recruiter over here at Twenty20 - we don&#x27;t use any agency recruiters at all, so the only way to get a job here is to apply directly :) To apply or just learn more, please email me at john@twenty20.com.","time":1398988608,"type":"comment"}
