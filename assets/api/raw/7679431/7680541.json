Our product is a management controller that works with OpenStack Swift. Swift gives deployers the ability to create scalable storage pools for modern applications, and SwiftStack provides the management tools for day-to-day operation of the cluster. We charge our customers a recurring license fee for the management software based on how much storage capacity they have deployed.<p>SwiftStack (the company) is about 2.5 years old. We&#x27;ve got about 30 employees, and we&#x27;re actively hiring developers. Here&#x27;s a short list of some things we&#x27;re currently working on:<p><pre><code>    - New features and bugfixes in OpenStack Swift\n    - Making clean, responsive UIs to simply communicate information about large storage clusters\n    - Using metrics to diagnose errors and proactively fix them for customers\n\n</code></pre>\nInterested in knowing more?
