We created the Axon wearable camera system, and its accompanying cloud service Evidence.com, to record video from an officer&#x27;s perspective and document exactly what occurred during each interaction with the public. We&#x27;re already managing petabytes of digital evidence for law enforcement agencies, but there is an opportunity to have a much bigger impact on law enforcement with technology.  Everything from wearable biometric devices, to predictive policing with big data, to better mobile devices and software for officers to use in the field.<p>Our tight-knit software team is based in Seattle, and is made up of engineers with a variety of backgrounds at companies like Facebook, Microsoft, and small startups.","time":1398969676,"type":"comment"}
