We serve billions of transactions per day with super low latency through our online advertising platform.  We hack on C, Scala, Rails, Redis, Hadoop, HBase and Postgres.  We don&#x27;t expect you to be an expert in any of these technologies.  More than anything we&#x27;re looking for the right kind of can-do folks who thrive on building solid systems.<p>Maybe you&#x27;ve been wanting to learn Scala.  Maybe you&#x27;ve tinkered with Hadoop on a few EC2 instances but never had a chance to work with a ton of data.  We want you.  You&#x27;ll be joining a sharp team with a strong appetite for progress and a minimal amount of formal process.<p>I&#x27;m one of the engineers, and I&#x27;d be happy to chat about our team even if you don&#x27;t have a resume or consider yourself actively looking for a new gig.
