Everyone automatically gets events put in their phones calendar. Add photos from everyone&#x27;s phones while you&#x27;re there. Add photos from the SLR via Dropbox. Reminisce and chat about any of it later when you get back.<p>Oh and it&#x27;s gorgeous and with extreme attention to UX.<p>==================================<p>We&#x27;ve raised a 1mm seed round from Floodgate, Greylock, Ben Ling (former fb platform), and Scott Belsky (Behance now Adobe).<p>==================================<p>Looking for smart devs with great design sense or appreciation to build the next Dropbox.<p>Our stack: scala+redis+Postgres on backend, iOS and later Android (also scala).<p>Looking for people for any part of the stack, ideally full stack engineers.<p>Email: aaron@empiric.al","time":1398971300,"type":"comment"}
