We are focussed on providing exhaustive security solution to cloud apps, with minimal disruption in existing process. Using an old OS? no worries! Don&#x27;t like sidecar deployment and management? no issues! Want out-of-box security and yet with an option to go as fine-grained as possible? now we are talking!<p>We are hiring for Rust engineers - not beginners but Rustaceans. Ideally those who have contributed to crates or written production code in Rust, will fit right in. The pay will be competitive for Bay area. We are very early stage, so can&#x27;t offer lot of perks (don&#x27;t even have a dog as part of team, so we can put its picture on team page). However, covered insurance, relocation can be considered, flexible office hours, etc. Above all, great team to work with - very experienced, technical, yet grounded team.<p>Please reach out through ntrivedi{}gmail and i&#x27;ll be very happy to talk to you. Cheers!","time":1544642925,"type":"comment"}
