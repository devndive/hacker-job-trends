We scan a business&#x27;s public infrastructure over the internet, detect potential threats and make (non-technical) customers aware of them in a manageable way through our product, which is a React web application backed by a Node&#x2F;express API.<p>The product is shipped and in beta at the moment, after 10 months of work. I&#x27;m looking for product engineers to help further improve the product and add the long list of exciting features we have planned. You&#x27;ll be joining a distributed team led by me from the London office. You&#x27;ll be based in Porto, as one of the first people in the new office we&#x27;re opening there.<p>You are a product-focused full stack engineer who wants to build web applications with React. You should have solid demonstrable experience building React web apps. You should have the ability to build full stack features (database down to CSS) without help. You should have some experience building APIs - the language&#x2F;framework is not that important though you should be happy to work in Node&#x2F;express.<p>Please email me directly at dave+hn@kynd.io to apply. I&#x27;m Dave, lead product engineer here - you&#x27;ll be joining my team.
