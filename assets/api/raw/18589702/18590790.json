We know that it takes focus and intentional planning to make a distributed office a success, and we&#x27;re looking to partner with an experienced engineer to take on the role of site lead and build out the office.<p>Your day to day will include:<p>- People Management: Work with Vancouver engineers to make sure they&#x27;re happy, healthy, and engaged. Ensure that the team grows in a way that makes sense for both the office and Streak overall. Lead hiring in Vancouver and work with the Streak recruiting team to source great candidates. Facilitate communication both within the site and with the San Francisco team.<p>- Engineering: We&#x27;re not particular about where in the stack you&#x27;re looking to contribute (see our existing engineering reqs for some possibilities, but we&#x27;re flexible), but we are looking for somebody with a strong engineering background who wants to be hands-on as the team gets off the ground. As the team grows, we&#x27;ll figure out together what division of time makes sense.<p>- Site coordination: Figure out office logistics, which events we should be attending, how we should set up lunch catering, etc.<p>We are excited about you if you:<p>- You&#x27;re an experienced engineer. You&#x27;ve contributed significantly to an evolving codebase and have the learnings to show from it.<p>- You&#x27;re an experienced leader. You&#x27;ve been a people manager, a product manager, or a tech lead for a significant team or product.<p>- You&#x27;re excited to own an engineering office end-to-end.<p>It would be phenomenal if:<p>- You have experience with distributed teams, especially in management.<p>- You&#x27;re familiar with the tech ecosystem in Vancouver. We&#x27;re new here ourselves and would love to partner with someone who knows their way around.<p>To learn more about the company and how we operate check out our careers page (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.streak.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.streak.com&#x2F;careers</a>).<p>Please email me directly if you&#x27;re interested in this position: omar@streak.com","time":1543858637,"type":"comment"}
