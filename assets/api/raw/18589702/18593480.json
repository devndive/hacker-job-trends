If you want to do the startup jig this is about as good as it gets -- a cornucopia of interesting tech and a fresh approach to an old problem. Big problems to solve, huge areas of control over the future, and good equity.<p>The website shows almost a year-old version of the product&#x2F;pitch, it&#x27;s come quite far since then. The pitch is a knowledge app platform that runs entirely on device, with great search, and which learns your company vocabulary and profiles of everyone with who is good at what. Our &quot;secret&quot; is an augmented system for actually understanding your screen at all times and showing augmented information&#x2F;updates inline, anywhere you are.<p>Combine state of the art on-device NLP, a novel OCR system that scans a dense screen of text in &lt;250ms, and a years in the making UI&#x2F;app system that is wholly unique, and you&#x27;re at a very interesting crossroads.<p>What I need is one great developer who leans towards Frontend and React. But ideally loves moving between front and back, is motivated by tackling big problems and building a truly incredible product&#x2F;experience, and is willing to sacrifice some salary for equity (the typical startup pitch). But the nice part is -- we have the best investors (Founders Fund), it&#x27;s very close to launch, and the problems we&#x27;re solving are absolutely engaging.<p>I need someone in SF. I&#x27;ve tried remote, but for something this early it just needs to be in-person.<p>Reach out to me, natewienert &#x2F;at&#x2F; gmail.com","time":1543874058,"type":"comment"}
