We are always looking for talented people to join our team locally, remotely, and for those looking for change to relocate to our headquarters in Toronto. We strive to constantly learn, question the crowd, push the boundaries of what AI + web technology can do, and solve difficult problems. That&#x27;s why...<p>Kira Systems is hiring (Clojure) developers to work in all places within our stack. Whether it&#x27;s working on the front-end, or back-end, or working on complex problems, we have a place for you. Don&#x27;t know clojure? Don’t worry we&#x27;re just looking for great people (with a proclivity for functional programming) that have a passion for building something amazing.<p>We think: growth potential, values, and attitudes are equally important to be a successful Kiran. If you&#x27;re prepared to grow and aren’t above doing anything (we’re pretty low ego over here - we just do what needs to get done!), consider applying. We understand that the most creative solutions require diversity of thought and life experiences.<p>Kira Systems believes that at the foundation of our success are the people who work here. We are an equal opportunity employer and believe our diversity is a driver of success at our company. We want thinkers, dreamers, doers and believers.  No matter your walk of life we potentially have a role for you.<p>Interested?
