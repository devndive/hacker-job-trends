We build the world&#x27;s biggest and fastest satellites, providing service to homes, business, airlines, and more. Our technology connects parents to children, soldiers to their commanders, and emergency responders to support lines, whether they&#x27;re in Dayton, OH or climbing the slopes of Denali.<p>We were founded in San Diego in 1986 by three engineers who sought to build the company they wanted to work for, and that emphasis on our employees continues to this day. It sounds a little silly, but we still retain a lot of the beach town influence from that founding, this many years on. Iâ€™ve been with the company for over eight years now (a decade if you count internships!), through a number of different projects and teams, and still love working here.<p>We are hiring for a couple positions in the Seattle office I run:<p>* Product Owner, Identity - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2DWs9DT\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2DWs9DT</a><p>* Security Software Engineer - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2APViNX\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2APViNX</a><p>Email stephan dot kemper at viasat.com, or apply online.<p>Candidates only; recruiter&#x2F;agency emails will be used only to train our spam filters :)","time":1543899585,"type":"comment"}
