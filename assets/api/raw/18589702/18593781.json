TileDB efficiently stores structured data from a variety of applications (genomics, finance, imaging, LiDAR, etc) in a novel unified format as sparse or dense multi-dimensional arrays.  Users store their data in a single place, while being able to efficiently access it via a growing range of languages and environments (C&#x2F;C++, Python, R, SQL database engines). TileDB adopts the best ideas from columnar and spatial database research, supporting fast updates, excellent compression, and interoperability with cloud object storage backends.<p>TileDB, Inc. has just closed a new $3M financing round (official announcements coming up soon), having raised $4M in total seed funding over the past 18 months, and is looking to aggressively expand its team. The new members of TileDB will help us build out a solution to enhance cloud interoperability, compute on TileDB data more easily, and improve areas such as data consistency, access control and sharing.  We are looking for backend&#x2F;frontend engineers, experts in cloud technologies (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), database engines, scientific programming (Python, R), and bioinformatics data engineering.<p>TileDB GitHub organization: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TileDB-Inc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TileDB-Inc</a><p>TileDB has been featured on HN: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15547749\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15547749</a>.<p>Our headquarters are located in Cambridge, MA.
