We have both backend infra ML teams as well as applied ML Modeling groups.<p>We are currently hiring a Data Scientist for one of our applied ML Modeling teams based out of the Boston office. SF candidates may be considered as well but majority of team is in Boston.<p>The team is very senior and lean (9 people) while having a lot of impact across multiple product areas at Twitter. We routinely take on high-risk high-reward consumer modeling projects and see them through from exploration to implementation.<p>We like well rounded people with diverse skillsets across the entire ML&#x2F;Data stack. In particular we care about skepticism and creativity. Experience working with social graph and highly skewed datasets is also a plus.<p>E-mail me directly at fportman@twitter.com. I&#x27;m an engineer on the team.","time":1543864135,"type":"comment"}
