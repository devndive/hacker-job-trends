Through end-to-end encryption and developer-friendly integrations, EnvKey makes it easy to keep config in sync everywhere it&#x27;s needed while preventing third party access.<p>We&#x27;ve got early traction with close to 100 paying organizations and strong organic growth based on word-of-mouth from developers. Now we&#x27;re building a more robust and flexible v2 based on customer feedback and demand from larger companies.<p>We&#x27;re looking for two founding engineers to help get v2 over the finish line and establish a great team.<p>You&#x27;ll mainly be working with some combination of TypeScript, React, Redux, Golang, Docker, Kubernetes, and Serverless. Since we need lots of integration libraries, there will also be opportunities to work with all kinds of other languages and platforms. Much of your work will be released under an open source license.<p>Comp includes competitive salary (120-150k), significant equity (up to 5%), platinum health insurance, and 5 weeks vacation. We also offer great work-life balance and an engineer-focused culture.<p>More details and job descriptions here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;envkey-1&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;envkey-1&#x2F;jobs</a><p>Interested?
