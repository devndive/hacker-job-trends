Millions of farmers globally don&#x27;t have access to the basic farm tools the rest of the world depends on for food production, good seed and fertilizer. We sell these proven agricultural tools on credit, and use satellite data and ML to figure out who we can lend to profitably.<p>We use Scala, Python&#x2F;NumPy&#x2F;SciPy (for science&#x2F;ML), android and are heavy postgres users. We&#x27;re building great software for places with low reliability networks and harsh environmental conditions. We&#x27;re entering our third year and we can&#x27;t keep up with the demand from smallholder farmers.<p>To apply, send me an email at earl@apolloagriculture.com","time":1543855455,"type":"comment"}
