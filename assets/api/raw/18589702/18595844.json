We don&#x27;t hire for this team very often, but we&#x27;re looking to hire a couple of people now.  We last posted on this thread about a year ago, and successfully found someone on the current team, so we&#x27;re trying it again.<p>Despite our small size, we&#x27;re in charge of a number of important products.  We run the software that powers YC&#x27;s application process, software that almost every investor in silicon valley uses (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.ycombinator.com&#x2F;investor-day-software&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.ycombinator.com&#x2F;investor-day-software&#x2F;</a>), and Bookface, a private community site that is very actively used by YC founders.  This year we launched two big new projects - Startup School (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;startupschool.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;startupschool.com&#x2F;</a>) and Work at a Startup (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;workatastartup.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;workatastartup.com&#x2F;</a>).<p>An unusual aspect of being on the YC software team is that you&#x27;ll get full access to the YC program, founders and partners - from our dinner talks to demo day.  You&#x27;ll learn the ins and outs of how YC works, and you&#x27;ll get to know and learn from hundreds of companies.  If you want to start a startup someday, working at YC would be an excellent jumping off point.<p>We also offer highly competitive compensation and benefits, including equity in YC&#x27;s portfolio.
