Here is what happened when you called me:<p>CB: Since you&#x27;re in the middle of your job search, and you have good work experience and we have limited time, we&#x27;ll skip technical interview if you pass our test with 4.5 score or above and I will connect you right with Director of Engineering.<p>ME: OK<p>CB: Here is 40-minute TripleByte test.<p>ME: Done<p>CB (the next day): You scored a 5&#x2F;5 and in the 96th percentile! I would love to move forward and have you speak with XXX, Director of Engineering<p>ME: OK<p>(non-technical call with director of engineering)<p>CB (next day): we have decided to proceed with other candidates (automated response)<p>ME: (reached out to HR, no response)<p>Just wanted to know if you have any updates on this? I believe you&#x27;re doing a great job and I wanted to know what went wrong? (I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s my age, nationality, or technical experience). This is the only place I can get reply from you since you&#x27;re not responding.","time":1543986215,"type":"comment"}
