This person would take over day-to-day operations of the infrastructure (ie., monitoring, scaling, backups, security, etc.), help improve our internal tools/reporting, and lend a hand wherever needed.  We're a (very) small team, so you'd need to be comfortable taking on a range of tasks and being mostly self-led; and you'll have a better chance of fitting-in if you're interested in books, reading, literacy, etc.<p>We're using: AWS (EC2/S3/RDS/ELB/CDN/etc.), Ubuntu, Nginx, Django/Python, ElasticSearch, RabbitMQ, Graphite, Fabric, etc.<p>Ping me (I'm sure you can find me) or careers@kirkus.com if interested.","time":1367427274,"type":"comment"}
