Sound familiar? It’s built by former Googlers, who realized that not all of the world’s data and information is available online. We gather this data through our “smartphone army” and distill it into actionable insights  that brands like Gap, Subway, and Coke require but are unable to obtain.<p>Our team includes talented alumni from Google, SCVNGR, LevelUp, MIT, and UC Berkeley. Our investors are seasoned entrepreneurs themselves with a track record of several $100M and even $1B exits and have backed companies like Pinterest.<p>We are a team of 10 and are looking for scrappy and talented folks to join us in disrupting a stagnant, multi-billion dollar market. Come join us in our awesome digs at the dome   of Old City Hall in Downtown Boston.<p>saikat@getmobee.com","time":1367419515,"type":"comment"}
