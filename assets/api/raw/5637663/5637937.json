You'd be hard pushed to find another environment where you get to work on such a range of challenges. Everything from everyday web development, through to full on engineering on our RabbitMQ based email system that pushes out millions of emails every single day.<p>We have a development team based right next to Waterloo station in London and our HQ is in Windsor, Berkshire but you don't have to limit yourselves to those offices. We appreciate there are some outstanding developers out there who are only interested in remote work and we are more than happy to consider that option.<p>You can find a full job spec here: <a href=\"http://globalpersonals.theresumator.com/apply/3BSEPp/Ruby-Engineer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://globalpersonals.theresumator.com/apply/3BSEPp/Ruby-En...</a><p>You can find more info about who we are and what the company does here: <a href=\"http://globalpersonals.co.uk/about-us/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://globalpersonals.co.uk/about-us/</a><p>You can also check out our tech blog here: <a href=\"http://globaldev.co.uk/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://globaldev.co.uk/blog/</a> (our ruby 2.0.0 post was linked in the official 2.0.0 release notes)<p>We're also on the lookout for a full-time, permanent QA to join our team so if you know anyone, send them my way.<p>Email me if you'd rather not apply on our site or if you just want to find out more about the role or the company: sbuckley@globaldev.co.uk","time":1367417194,"type":"comment"}
