Intrans is here to change that by deploying the world's first mobile platform for on-demand freight shipping. Over $30 billion dollars a month is spent trucking freight around the US, without it, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In such a massive market, it's hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines, but until now, it has. This means hundreds of millions of dollars worth of freight capacity goes unfilled every month due to the old-school inefficiencies of the industry. We are changing that.<p>If you're ready to change the trucking industry, send your resume and GitHub profile to jobs@intrans.com. We're also looking for summer interns (engineering &#38; sales).","time":1367433264,"type":"comment"}
