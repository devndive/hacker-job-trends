We coordinate with multiple software teams on hard problems, in a complex Systems Oriented Architecture, with huge opportunities for savings (We speak in $M, not $k). A business-focused intuition is a must, but we also require strong technical skills and an ability to understand how our software models a huge supply chain. We use many different tools for the job: Linux/ZSH, SQL, R, Ruby, Java, Optimization solvers, Geospatial tools/libraries, and pretty much anything else that gets the job done (don't forget email and telephones). We aren't afraid of digging deep into details like log files, but we also aren't afraid of working with datasets that range in the hundreds of billions of rows.<p>If that sounds like a domain you are interested in, contact me: tooned||amazon&#60;&#62;com","time":1367420549,"type":"comment"}
