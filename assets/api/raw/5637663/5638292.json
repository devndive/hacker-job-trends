This is not a reliability engineering position like Facebook or Google however.  At Netflix our developers have the ability to push code whenever they feel it is the right time, and we don't want to get in their way.  Instead we want to build tools that make it easier for them to follow best practices.  We believe that a good process is one that is easier for the engineer to follow than work around, otherwise we haven't done our job.<p>The job is about 30% operational, where you'd be dealing with production issues and be the call leader for major outages, 30% evangelism, where you work with other teams to get them to adopt best practices and understand why they do what they do, and about 40% coding, where you'd be writing tools that help us maintain reliability, such as our alert routing system and automated production timeline tools, as well as our famous Simian Army.<p>If this sounds interesting, send your resume to talent@netflix.com and mention that you saw jedberg's post on HN.","time":1367420017,"type":"comment"}
