Does years of experience determine who the best engineers are? How about a whiteboarding session with people peppering you with questions - is that how you normally work?<p>We’re sorry that we don’t just do things because that’s how others do it. We may only be a simple startup, but we have this crazy idea that your past work, production code and open source contributions are the best indicators of your ability. If these are high quality, let’s talk.<p>This is who we are:<p>A small group (under 10) that has built two consumer facing products. We’re technology agnostic and believe the best developers can teach themselves what they need to learn. There are no politics, no prima donnas and we just like getting things done.<p><a href=\"https://www.ediviso.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.ediviso.com</a> is a consultation marketplace for experts to give advice via live video chat.<p><a href=\"https://www.catincan.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.catincan.com</a> is a crowdfunding platform for open source projects.<p>This is what we need:<p>Software Engineer that solves problems. You’re someone that figures things out, cares about code quality and understands technical debt. You like learning new languages and have your own method that’s worked for you time and again to get spun up on something quickly. Ideally you’ll also be able to understand the big picture and business models of products. We don’t just need another engineer, we need another team member.<p>If you know any of these we'll take it as a good sign but they're not required: Scala, Haskell, Prolog, Lisp, Eiffel, Erlang, Go,  Meteor, Coffeescript, Ember.js, AngularJS.<p>More info: <a href=\"https://www.catincan.com/ceo-bio\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.catincan.com/ceo-bio</a>","time":1368294681,"type":"comment"}
