You'll own the reliability, performance, and scalability of our systems, spending about half your time on infrastructure automation/maintenance and the other half building and improving back-end systems.<p>Our tech stack currently includes Python, Node.js, MySQL, Redis, Memcache, and Beanstalkd; plus Nagios for monitoring and Fabric for automation.<p>One key challenge we're having is ensuring uptime in the face of datacenter-level issues (we've had some) -- our customers rely on us to tell them when they're having problems, so we really need to be rock solid, at least on our API and data processing tiers. So far we're in 6 datacenters with DNS failover and a few other techniques, but there's much much more to do.<p>If this sounds interesting, email brian@rollbar.com and let's find a time to talk or meet up.","time":1367425176,"type":"comment"}
