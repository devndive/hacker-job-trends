Following that, creative thinking and problem solving will be key as we come up with more efficient and effective ways to get the firm's work done.<p>A love of baseball (and sports in general) is useful since we work in that world -- but it's not strictly required. We take great pride in being the best at what we do, and most of us have played team sports at a high level. It's a great place to work with low turnover, and we're excited to find someone new to join our team.<p>This is a full-time position in our Newport Beach office.<p>Obviously we're not your typical HN poster, but if it sounds like a good fit let us know at jobs at borascorp.com.<p>More information about us and our work: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Boras\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Boras</a>","time":1367424690,"type":"comment"}
