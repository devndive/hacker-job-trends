We have 7 people. We're deploying to hospitals in 4 time zones and growing rapidly. We value creative people who will help dream up new products for our platform.  We're pretty flexible, but at least at the beginning you need to be comfortable spending a higher amount of face-to-face time in our office.<p>Ruby on Rails Developer<p>At the moment, we want experienced web application developers who can point us to relevant accomplishments and will be happy to show us their abilities with a test project. We prefer friendly folks who are quick to ask questions and help each other out. We need self-starters who would enjoy the opportunity to brainstorm new ideas for our products and look forward to the opportunity to interact with customers.<p>Experienced Healthcare Salesperson<p>If you are an excellent salesperson highly experienced in sales to hospitals, this will be an outstanding opportunity for you. Customers are coming to us and we have had to do very little in sales. Our potential pipeline is huge and you could make a huge impact on our expansion.  We need someone who already knows what matters to the various stakeholders in each hospital and can capably explain how our products are a win for all of them.
