We help users engage in discussions on large sites like CNN and IGN as well as many of the tech blogs submitted on Hacker News.<p>This week, we launched Gravity (<a href=\"http://disqus.com/gravity/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://disqus.com/gravity/</a>) as an experiment in discovery and visualization of our huge network. It's built with D3.js on top of our realtime service and postgres backend. We're inventing the future of online discussions, and our massive scale has positioned us well to do just that. tl;dr - we're more than just comments.<p>To change the future, we need your help. Like everyone else, we're hiring for everything (frontend / backend / data). But we really need some additional folks to join our small devops team. If you're passionate about any of the following, shut down everything and contact me immediately (mike@disqus.com):<p>* Performance - help us run database queries faster, eliminate slow requests, remove bottlenecks<p>* Availability - improve the likelihood that when users visit a site, Disqus loads<p>* Automation - we use puppet with our homegrown external node classifier to manage hundreds of dedicated hardware devices<p>* Data - our cassandra cluster handles billions of writes daily<p>I'd love to tell you more about the cool stuff we're doing with nginx, cassandra, and postgres.<p>If working on our ops team sounds fun, or any of our other positions at <a href=\"http://disqus.com/jobs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://disqus.com/jobs/</a> are up your alley, please reach out to me at mike@disqus.com.","time":1367432109,"type":"comment"}
