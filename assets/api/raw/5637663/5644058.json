One of our products is a hardware monitoring and management platform that makes it simple to administer tens or hundreds of thousands of devices. This is what you will primarily be working on. Parts of the project use interesting new technologies like Redis and Go, and we're also looking at Cassandra/Riak and at some graph databases as well. You'll be working very closely with two other Rails developers.<p>We're a small but well-established company with a fun work environment, challenging problems to solve, and the freedom to choose and implement the best solution for those problems.<p>If you are interested, send a résumé to shawn.goff@accelecon.com .","time":1367498358,"type":"comment"}
