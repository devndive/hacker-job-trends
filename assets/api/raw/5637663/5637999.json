With 500,000 sales across iOS and Android and a pricetag from $3.99 to $7.99, it's the most successful smartphone fitness game in the world - and it's been nominated for awards by Develop, the Design Museum, SXSW, and more.<p>We want an Android developer who can help make our games - including Zombies, Run! and a new project with the Department of Health - even better and even more polished by using the latest software and hardware features in Android 4.0. And we want someone who can help think up and create entirely new game concepts that use smartphones, tablets, and other wearable devices and computers in novel ways.<p>In other words, we want your help to make the games of the future.<p>Why we're different: we get emails every day from people whose lives we’ve improved with our games - people who’ve lost weight, become healthier, and gained confidence. There’s nothing like knowing that your work is valued by hundreds of thousands and is doing good in the world.<p>Email hello (at) sixtostart.com or see more details at <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/33968/android-devs-zombies-run-needs-you-to-help-six-to-start\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/33968/android-devs-zom...</a>","time":1367417585,"type":"comment"}
