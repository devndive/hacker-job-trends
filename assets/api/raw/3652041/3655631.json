We have a noble goal of trying to help shoppers find products in store. Surprisingly, the vast majority of people still do most of their shopping in stores and we help them shop wisely. How? We show you the different pricing options and the distances to stores so you can decide if it is cost- and time-effective to go shop at a local store or use other options. In my opinion, we complement eBay shopping pretty well.<p>I joined this team as a data engineer a few months back and really enjoy the work environment. We still retain the startup culture (read more on the website) and also get the benefits of the larger company (eBay), which includes technical expertise and operational support.<p>We are currently looking for data engineers (and quite a few other positions as well). I work on the data team and we get to do a variety of interesting and technically challenging projects. You get to learn how the different pieces of the puzzle fit together and interact with different teams. I have the joy of working with some really smart people. I can honestly say, I look forward to going to work every day after having worked from home for the past couple of years at my previous job.<p>But, I have to warn you, once you get a taste of Milo, you may not want to go anywhere else...<p>Oh... and we mainly use Python and we are going to Pycon as well.
