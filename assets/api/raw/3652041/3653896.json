We are improving and scaling that all the time, as well as building tools that bring real value to mobile advertising, such as desktop-to-mobile retargeting and rich analytics.<p>Main languages in use at the moment are Scala for the heavy lifting, Ruby (on Rails), and JavaScript for UIs. We deploy constantly, and we have a <i>lot</i> of data to play with. Engineering drives the company, which is now pushing 20 full-timers.<p>If you are smart, productive, and like working with great people on a high performance system, I want to talk to you!<p>We are hiring for backend, front-end, and big data engineers.
