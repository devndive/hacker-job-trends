We think we're revolutionizing the way data and services are distributed and consumed and we’re backed by top tier VCs in the world such NEA, Index Ventures, Charles River Ventures and Ignition Partners; as well as outstanding angels such Jeff Bezos (Amazon CEO) and Eric Schmidt’s (Google President) Innovation Endeavors.<p>You can email me or hackers@mashape.com<p>More info: <a href=\"http://blog.mashape.com/become-a-mashaper-were-looking-for-a-frontend\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.mashape.com/become-a-mashaper-were-looking-for-a...</a><p>We have one of the biggest stack for a small startup in Silicon Valley - Including: Java, Play framework, Ruby, Python, Obj-C, PHP, Erlang, node.js, Javascript, Memcached  MongoDB, SimpleDB and DynamoDB, HTML5/CSS3 with LESS, Git, Maven, Linux/CentOS. Soon we'll add Scala and .NET and C#.  As we scale we're going to use Hadoop, Lucene/Sphinx, Redis and a bunch of other amazing technologies. Tech challenges? Well, all the API calls pass through a proxy, the Mashape proxy, so scaling this shit to billion of calls/month while keeping a latency under 100ms or storing and analyzing the huge of amount of data that pass through it every second won't be easy.","time":1330613394,"type":"comment"}
