Remote is an option for the right candidates, but we have a strong preference for someone local or willing to relocate.<p>We're a small startup in the healthcare sector. We take data from public and private sources and allow healthcare companies (hospital systems, non-profits, etc) to look at markets from multiple angles. Our biggest competitor is Thomson Rueters. More information on our full job post on GitHub: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/1827430\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gist.github.com/1827430</a><p>Currently our team consists of two developers (and an intern), with 20+ years of programming experience between us. We are lazy developers, so we like to do things correctly the first time around (this means unit tests, readable code, etc.) so we can go home and be with our families.  Rockstars, ninjas, and studs need not apply. If this sounds like a good fit for you, email us. We would prefer a mid- to senior-level developer, but if you're a junior and looking for mentorship in the trade, we still want to talk to you.<p>You can email jobs@stratasan.com, or email me directly at brian@ (same domain).","time":1330613019,"type":"comment"}
