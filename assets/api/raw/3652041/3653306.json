We've just launched to developers (come play!) and are looking for people who {heart} data and want to charge through scaling and design iterations with us.<p>Apply through <a href=\"https://singly.com/#About-WorkWithUs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://singly.com/#About-WorkWithUs</a> or kristjan@singly.com, or just come hang with us in #lockerproject on Freenode.","time":1330626251,"type":"comment"}
