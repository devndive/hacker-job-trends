But that's not what is important; what is important is that we are %100 focused on building the product to provide the best customer experiences possible. That means better algorithms for worker dispatch, great UI to communicate a complicated value proposition, and better customer service and operations tools.<p>The team is four people right now. We are looking for a very small number of highly talented people that we enjoy working with. I've been in startups for 8 years and have seen many mistakes. I've made many myself. This startup I'm not going to make any of the same mistakes: we're going to make entirely new ones ;)<p>Job posts here: <a href=\"http://iamexec.com/hiring\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://iamexec.com/hiring</a><p>Join us and invent the future of work.
