We want to bring the same kind of predictive analytics investment banks use to online advertising. Think of this as one giant optimization problem, with tremendous rewards if we can get it right.<p>We're currently a team of 4, but looking to grow the team over the next year. Some of the technologies we use every day include Python, PostgreSQL, Javascript, Git, Bash, and Linux; experience in any of these is great, but we also like generalists that can pick up new things quickly. Big data, machine learning, and analytics experience is encouraged.<p>jobs@mixrank.com<p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/30/want-to-see-which-ads-perform-best-yc-backed-mixrank-is-a-spy-tool-for-adsense/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/30/want-to-see-which-ads-perfo...</a>\n<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/13/display-ad-data-intelligence-startup-mixrank-raises-1-5m-from-mark-cubam-500-startups/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/13/display-ad-data-intelligenc...</a>","time":1330630816,"type":"comment"}
