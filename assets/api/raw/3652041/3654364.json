We're a 501(c)(3) non-profit that has been around for more than a decade developing and operating a variety of web-based software for governments and other non-profits, starting with our popular housing database product at <a href=\"http://www.socialserve.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.socialserve.com/</a>.  We take pride in focusing on the needs of our users and providing excellent value to our customers.<p>We're a handful of developers who get our job done using Macs on the desktop, Linux on our servers, and a bevy of open source software including Python, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Apache, and Git.  While we're not strict adherents to any single software development methodology, we gladly incorporate processes that produce better software and happier developers including continuous integration, automated testing, and code reviews.<p>We're looking for developers with good knowledge of SQL, web development, basic Unix/Linux usage, and general computer science topics.  Knowledge of Python is preferred, though may not be strictly necessary as we've found it pretty easy to pick up as long as you have experience in a couple other languages.<p>Interested?
