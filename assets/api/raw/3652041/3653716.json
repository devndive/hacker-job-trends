We build tools and an API that helps ticket brokers buy and sell event tickets from each other and to customers.  Chances are if you bought a ticket online, it was from a website that uses our system.<p>Our systems use Ruby on Rails, Postgres and Redis (with Resque) for queueing, JavaScript and BackBone.js.  We also have a lot of interesting challenges, such as scaling out an API that provides ticket inventory throughout the internet, guaranteeing orders are always processed correctly, and building responsive web-based applications.<p>If this sounds like fun, please send me an email at rsosinski@ticketevolution.com.","time":1330631642,"type":"comment"}
