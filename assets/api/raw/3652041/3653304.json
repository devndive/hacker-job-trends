Lots of companies have the same use-case: they need to track their content as it travels through Twitter and Facebook, and capture how much traffic that generates them, and ultimately how much money that makes them, e.g. in purchases, signups or page views. We do all of that for them, so they don't have to reinvent the wheel. We have a bunch of APIs and big-data crunching to make it possible, and we're getting bigger and faster and adding features all the time.<p>We're hiring 2x front-end engineers, and 2x back-end engineers:<p><a href=\"http://awe.sm/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://awe.sm/jobs</a><p>For front-end: we have a web app written in Backbone.js, and are looking for people who are (or want to be) great at JavaScript, and are already great at CSS.<p>For back-end: we are more concerned with \"smart and gets things done\" than your actual language set, but big data and high-performance real-time systems should be interesting to you. Currently we have systems written in PHP, Ruby (on Sinatra) and a fair amount of Bash.<p>We're a team of 10, rising to 14 once we hire you people. Our perks include offices with an awesome view ( <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/seldo/6326815086/in/photostream\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/seldo/6326815086/in/photostream</a> ) at 22nd and Mission, catered lunch 3x a week, and a company IRC server, which should tell you a lot about the kind of devs we are.","time":1330626221,"type":"comment"}
