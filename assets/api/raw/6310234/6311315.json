We&#x27;re completely bootstrapped (and intend to stay that way) and currently a team of 2.5, but already with a Fortune 200 company on board as a paying customer.<p>Our stack consists of Postgres, Rails, Redis, and lots o&#x27; Angular. We&#x27;re looking for a quick learner who has experience with any of the above, however how minimal that may be. API development experience a huge plus.<p>If interested, ping me at jamie@pathgather.com.
