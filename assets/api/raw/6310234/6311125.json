We prefer candidates local to the Los Angeles area, but are open to remote work for great candidates, and have a handful of remote workers already (including myself).<p>We have the culture and perks you&#x27;d expect from a VC funded startup, without the burn rate.  Our compensation is competitive with large tech companies.  We&#x27;re not big enough (yet) to have much of a bureaucracy, and we&#x27;re focused on keeping that to a minimum.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in learning more, you can contact me (I&#x27;m a cofounder - will@ziprecruiter.com) or apply here:<p><a href=\"http://www.ziprecruiter.com/job/Software-Engineer-perl-and-or-python/717efc00/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ziprecruiter.com&#x2F;job&#x2F;Software-Engineer-perl-and-o...</a>","time":1378055078,"type":"comment"}
