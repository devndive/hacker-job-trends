What if Xcode compiled your Objective-C source code to run on Android automatically, with no changes required? Our platform makes this a reality for thousands of mobile developers. And weâ€™re growing fast.<p>In just one week since its launch, over 1 million users installed Dots on Android. Dots was developed on iOS using the Objective-C cocos2d-iphone game engine. Without writing single line of Java, Betaworks used Apportable to compile it for Android, where it become the #5 most popular app. We deal primarily with developers like these -- top iOS game developers -- by giving them technology they want.<p>We&#x27;re growing quickly (team of 40, mostly engineers) and are looking to hire another software engineer to join our platform team. We&#x27;re based in San Francisco and are backed by YC, Google Ventures, and other prominent investors. Experience with Objective-C, OpenGL ES, and other compiled languages will be helpful.<p>If this sounds interesting and you&#x27;re ready to change the way that mobile apps are developed, email us at jobs+hn@apportable.com.
