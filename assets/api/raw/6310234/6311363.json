We&#x27;re always trying new technology to fit the appropriate situation, and at VTS you&#x27;ll definitely pick up a few skills you haven&#x27;t learned elsewhere. We like devs who are open to expanding their skillset and eager to become masters of all the tools we use.<p>We&#x27;re looking for people who have extensive web OR mobile experience (or of course, both). We&#x27;re a Rails shop and looking to build our first iOS product as well, but if you aren&#x27;t familiar with these platforms, that doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t apply. So shoot us an email, and let&#x27;s start collaborating!","time":1378058764,"type":"comment"}
