We know that politics and bureaucracy never make for great products, so we focus on results and creating high-quality, user-centric software. Ideas and innovation thrive in our open, meritocratic culture.<p>Software engineering is the heart of our company. We rely on developers to work across the company to drive features and come up with innovative ideas. Our engineering team iterates rapidly with a focus on clean coding. This means a leaner specification process and an excellent end product that&#x27;s been built with the type of feedback you can only get by trying out aspects of each feature as they&#x27;re developed.<p>As a software engineer at EnergySavvy, youâ€™ll work with Django, Python, jQuery, nginx and  PostgreSQL, and deploy your creations early and often to live customers. We don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;ve never tried Python or Django.
