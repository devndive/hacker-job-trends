{"by":"hcho","id":6310639,"parent":6310234,"text":"TagCmd - London, UK - Full time. Sorry, no work permits, no remote.<p>I am looking for JS developers. We are using Backbone, but experience in Angular, Ember, Knockout or even your own client side framework is as good. We are using a bit of node.js for our fixture server, I guess we can transition a person with that kind of experience too. What really matters is that you know your JS.<p>This is not a startup so no equity, no foosball tables, no free lunches and such...The pay is average for London, too. So what&#x27;s good about that job? We are running at a marathon pace rather than a sprint. We cleared 2 major milestones last year and no one had worked a minute of overtime. Maybe you are building a business on the side, patio11 style, or maybe you are trying to recover from a failed startup, this job would suit you well. I also try to protect my people from meetings, there are a few guys who like that.<p>I don&#x27;t really care for CVs, if you have one send it, otherwise tell me what you did with JavaScript in a paragraph or two. Shoot me an email if interested;address in profile.","time":1378048002,"type":"comment"}
