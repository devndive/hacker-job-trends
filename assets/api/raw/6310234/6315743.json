They&#x27;ve already got an MVP built and have families using it, and they want someone to help them expand it. It&#x27;s early-stage, so you&#x27;ll be building the actual user-facing product and directly seeing how users like it.<p>Send them an email if you&#x27;re interested! I definitely recommend them, they are really nice guys too.","time":1378138091,"type":"comment"}
