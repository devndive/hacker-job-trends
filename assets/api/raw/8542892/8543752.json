But we are interested in having fun and building cool software.<p>FlareWorks is a visual messaging startup headquartered in San Francisco, California. Our mission is to build a platform for contextual, visual communication between family and friends that is easier and simpler than Texting. In short - &quot;Kill Text&quot;. Our company’s visual messaging service —called Flares— uses visual cues, instead of text, to provide communication shortcuts between friends and family. We&#x27;re a seed funded, early stage startup, so this is an opportunity to get in on the ground floor. You would be engineer number 3. We&#x27;re looking for Android developers to help us take our mobile application and platform to the next level. Our mobile apps are the face of the organization and, as such, you’ll be on the front lines of creating an application and experience that has the potential to be used by millions of people every day. We&#x27;re currently in the Apple app store and are now looking to expand into Android&#x2F;Google Play. Our app was featured as the &quot;best new app&quot; by Apple the first week it was released and we have consistently received great press for our MVP.<p>Our Stack: \n  * Node for our API.\n  * Erlang&#x2F;Elixir for our platform.<p>What we offer:\n  * We&#x27;re not fans of 9-5 with a lunch break.
