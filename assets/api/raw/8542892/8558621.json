{"by":"DLarsen","id":8558621,"parent":8542892,"text":"Connexity - Camarillo, CA (Los Angeles area)<p>We&#x27;re hunting for a Rails Developer to continue to build out our online advertising platform.  We work at a scale where seemingly &quot;small&quot; improvements can have a big impact.  In the last 24 hours, we served over 60 million impressions and processed over 6 billion total transactions.<p>You&#x27;d take ownership of the Rails app, which is the primary means of managing hundreds of campaigns running through our platform.  This role is a great way to learn advertising tech as well as other tools.  You&#x27;d get exposure to Redis, Hbase, PostgreSQL, and Scala.  In other words, this isn&#x27;t just a boring, run-of-the-mill CRUD app.<p>Our team is sharp and works well together.  While we enjoy perks such as paid lunch and unlimited vacation, the culture of our team recognizes and respects the importance of your non-work life.  Also, Ventura county is a pretty nice place to live&#x2F;work.<p>Unless you prefer to start with a HR-oriented chat, you can reach me (a senior dev on the team) at dlarsen@connexity.com.  Informal inquiries are great.","time":1415130273,"type":"comment"}
