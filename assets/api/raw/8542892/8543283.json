This week we shipped our latest release - a new learning platform that enables people to learn programming in a real dedicated server environment, all in a browser. The first content we shipped on it is a Ruby on Rails course:<p><a href=\"http://codecademy.com/learn/make-a-rails-app\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;codecademy.com&#x2F;learn&#x2F;make-a-rails-app</a><p>Building this stuff is a really fun technical challenge on many levels, and there are exciting developments on this new platform in the pipeline.<p>I really enjoy working on Codecademy.
