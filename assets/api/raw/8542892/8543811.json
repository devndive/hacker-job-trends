We also believe fees should be lower for landlords and tenants alike, and that technology should improve the lives of everyone in the rental sector.<p>So far we&#x27;ve transacted with over 160,000 landlords and just over a million tenants.<p>We are a Rails shop and we believe in TDD + the best solution winning the day, rather than the loudest voice. We favour engineers who focus on shipping and who have a track record of simplifying, cutting corners, and knowing when it&#x27;s a good thing to accrue some technical debt.<p>Our office in London is right next door to Barbican tube station. It&#x27;s dual facing so there&#x27;s lots of natural sunlight, and we have a bar, soft drinks and snacks, a bunch of breakout spaces, video games, and all that sort of thing. We pay market + stock options, and have a strong culture, which I&#x27;d broadly characterise as hard-working, fun, and informal.<p>We&#x27;re recruiting for all experience levels: some combination of Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript is required, but mainly we want a strong work ethic and a winning personality. We&#x27;re especially keen to hear from women who are in the junior - midweight bracket.<p>If you&#x27;ve had a bad experience using an estate agent, then come and help us create a future without them.
