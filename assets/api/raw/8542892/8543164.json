Bonus points for having native development experience. Ionic is one of the top ~50 most popular open source projects on GitHub (and growing quickly!), and already over 220,000 apps have been built on the platform in 2014.<p>As a backend dev, you&#x27;ll be helping us build out the business model behind the open source SDK. We have some big plans to take advantage of taboos around Hybrid development and build the most compelling mobile development stack in the world. Imagine the future of mobile apps running all on Ionic backend services. This is where we are going.<p>About us:<p>We&#x27;re a funded team of 14 primarily based in Madison but with employees around the country.
