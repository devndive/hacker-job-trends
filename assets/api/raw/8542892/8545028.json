The network has been live since January, and it has seen over 90k transactions since then.[1] Overstock.com recently announced that it would be building the world&#x27;s first SEC-regulated stock market for cryptosecurities on our platform.[2]<p>The non-profit Counterparty Foundation is hiring a developer to join a team of two (myself and one other) dedicated to further developing the Counterparty Protocol and software ecosystem (e.g. wallet software, block explorers). Experience with Python is strongly preferred, as much of the work will be with the protocol&#x27;s reference implementation, counterpartyd.[3]<p>It goes without saying, this is an unconventional position requiring a great deal of independence, self-direction and creativity.<p>Contact: adamk@counterparty.io<p>Web Wallet: <a href=\"https://counterwallet.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;counterwallet.io</a><p>[1] - <a href=\"https://blockscan.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blockscan.com</a><p>[2] - <a href=\"http://www.coindesk.com/overstock-hires-counterparty-developers-build-cryptosecurity-stock-exchange/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coindesk.com&#x2F;overstock-hires-counterparty-develop...</a><p>[3] - <a href=\"https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/counterpartyd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CounterpartyXCP&#x2F;counterpartyd</a>","time":1414885306,"type":"comment"}
