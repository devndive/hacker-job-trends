We&#x27;re open for INTERN and VISA... hell, even REMOTE if you&#x27;re awesome enough!!<p>About Sauce:<p>Sauce Labs is a SAAS+E2E series C startup in the bay area. We provide an automated testing cloud service so other companies don&#x27;t have to build their own Selenium or Appium grids. We pride ourselves about our values and transparency (<a href=\"https://saucelabs.com/our-values\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saucelabs.com&#x2F;our-values</a>). Oh, and a nice to have these days: we have a real business model!<p>About the Team:<p>Our CORE team is currently 6 people and we&#x27;re looking to double it over the next year. We build a highly available service that runs customer Selenium tests real time using VMs. Most of the team is in SF, with some members in EU working on a re-location.<p>About our Stack:<p>Sauce Labs runs on a Python + Twisted stack and we&#x27;re currently discussing technology changes to take it to the next level. We use KVM and VMWare for the vms, MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ and other fine tools.","time":1415214028,"type":"comment"}
