The tech stack will be a mix of Python, Scala and various JS MVC framework. What&#x27;s special about the position, IMHO is that our team has a direct working relationship with scientists in the lab (no biz-analysts in between), specifically supporting one lab where the mission is to develop novel genome sequencing techniques (e.g., pac-bio, nanopore sequencing) and another lab whose purpose is to sequence and analyze genomes of infectious disease pathogens (e.g., tuberculosis). So think no morning standup&#x27;s, &quot;tyranny of agile&quot; but more an ad-hoc academic environment where you&#x27;ll communicate &amp; work with biologists, have an opportunity to learn both the wet-lab and in silico process of genome sequencing&#x2F;assembly&#x2F;annotation, go to all the talks and workshops for different research groups, have ownership over the architecting, coding and dev-ops.<p>So if you&#x27;re interested in writing software without the management overhead of a traditional software org, be involved in Bioinformatics research, it might be a good opportunity for you to consider.<p>Organization-wise, the Broad is not a tech startup, but a genomics research institute that&#x27;s half-way between industry and academia; computational biology is a big deal here and background of a lot the scientist-users.<p><a href=\"https://www2.apply2jobs.com/BroadInstitute/ProfExt/index.cfm?fuseaction=mExternal.showJob&amp;RID=1506&amp;CurrentPage=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.apply2jobs.com&#x2F;BroadInstitute&#x2F;ProfExt&#x2F;index.cfm...</a>","time":1414871305,"type":"comment"}
