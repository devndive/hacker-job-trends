They have a stranglehold on in-person paperless payment. We want to provide an alternative.<p>Did you know that the credit card industry often makes way more money from retail stores than the store owners themselves? One of our store owners makes $60K a year while credit cards charged the store $72K.<p>At Kash, we&#x27;re on a mission to end the credit card monopoly and replace it with an option that helps retailers and that consumers love.<p>Right now our system works similar to the Starbucks app, but we&#x27;re always evaluating technology that can make the experience better.<p>Come chat with us if you think this is a worthy cause. After all, you don&#x27;t take down giants by doing things half-heartedly.<p>For more details and to apply, please visit <a href=\"https://jobs.lever.co/kash\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;kash</a>. Please mention that you saw us on HN.<p>Just want to get in touch? Please email me at danny@withkash.com","time":1414860219,"type":"comment"}
