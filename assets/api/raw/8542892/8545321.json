Startups, Fortune 500 companies, and everything in-between rely on us to alert them quickly when they have operational troubles.  We&#x27;ve got interesting technical problems in spades, just closed our Series B, and are still very much a startup.  We&#x27;re hiring for pretty much everything, technical and non-technical alike.<p>We don&#x27;t hire based on experience with a handful of tools. Instead, we want smart, capable, and experienced people who can learn our tools quickly (and suggest new ones!) as needed.  Experience with our stack is just a bonus.<p>SAN FRANCISCO:<p>* Software Engineer<p>* Senior Software Engineer<p>* Principal Engineer<p>* Sr. Persistence Engineer (Cassandra)<p>* Mobile Applications Engineering Manager<p>* Engineering Manager - DevTools<p>* Sr. DevOps Engineer<p>* Sr. DevTools Engineer<p>* Sr. Program Manager<p>* Evangelist<p>* Marketing &#x2F; Business Analyst<p>* Sr. Sales Operations Manager<p>* Customer Support Specialist<p>* Technical Support Engineer<p>* Sr. Manager of Website Marketing<p>TORONTO:<p>* Software Engineer<p>* Senior Software Engineer<p>* Principal Engineer<p>* Platform Engineering Manager<p>See the full list of job descriptions at <a href=\"http://www.pagerduty.com/jobs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pagerduty.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a>","time":1414893466,"type":"comment"}
