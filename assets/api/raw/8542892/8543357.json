Superstar, OpenSource Loving Engineer w&#x2F; Node.js experience at Electronifie<p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/13rU1dp\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;13rU1dp</a><p>We&#x27;re building the world&#x27;s first corporate bond trading platform in Node.js. Why is that interesting? Turns out the corporate bond market is a 10 Trillion dollar market that still works like it did in 1978, with traders calling each other up on the phone. Modernization that happened in equities never made it to the bond market. All the biggest players are calling for new solutions (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1tLXFZq\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;1tLXFZq</a>) and that&#x27;s exactly what we&#x27;re building. The incumbents in this space are big, slow moving, enterprises with six to twelve month release cycles and a fear of Open Source software. We push out updates and new features within days and are releasing our own tools back to the community.<p>Want to solve amazingly exciting problems with a small team of very experienced engineers? Want to help disrupt FinTech by leveraging OpenSource tools and running circles around the competition?<p>Come join us.","time":1414855558,"type":"comment"}
