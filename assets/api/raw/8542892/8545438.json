Our goal is to organize and summarize what&#x27;s important in your digital life.<p>We&#x27;ve raised 1MM to date from Floodgate + Greylock + Ben Ling (FB&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Khosla) + Scott Belsky (n√©e Behance, now Adobe), and are gearing up for launch of our new app.<p>We&#x27;re looking for fellow engineers who have design taste that ideally are full-stack and whip smart; you get major bonus points for also having NLP&#x2F;ML&#x2F;visualization skills. Our stack is Scala+Postgres+Redis on the backend, a custom json-based document model (think Parse but nicer API), and iOS &amp; Mac apps. Android&#x2F;web will come after.<p>We&#x27;ve got what we believe to be the next great cloud offering that smashes down data silos and facilitates far easier collaboration than is done by anybody today. Oh and it all looks and feels oh-so-pretty. We like pretty.<p>Empirical is very focused on strong morals (our original team came from building tech for post-earthquake Haiti), dreaming big, open sourcing our work (still to come), seeking diversity (the CEO, me, is gay &amp; Jewish for example), and frequent laughing.<p>Not much info on our site: <a href=\"http://empiric.al\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;empiric.al</a><p>My website for a taste of my work at MIT: <a href=\"http://azinman.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;azinman.com</a><p>Email: aaron@empiric.al","time":1414896850,"type":"comment"}
