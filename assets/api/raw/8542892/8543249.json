We are a start-up with a focus on Life Sciences in the area of advanced big data analytics connected to human health and extending lifespan. Currently our platform, GenoPharmÂ©, and solutions are free to academic institutions.<p>One of our immediate goals includes enabling an exhaustive exploration of all known and unknown relationships between age-related genes, proteins, compounds, pathways etc. associated to human longevity backed by the experimental findings of our own and those of our collaborators. For example, see a few of our data visualization projects here displaying pathway-to-pathway, pathway-to-gene&#x2F;protein hidden relationships and interactions.<p>Based on a patented (#7,987,191) platform, our system includes advanced and proprietary big data analytics, products, tools and interactive dynamic data visualizations for the purpose of uncovering hidden relationships between age-related genes, DNA repair genes, proteins, biological processes, molecular compounds, plant compounds (phytochemicals), enzymes, genomic pathways, micro and macro environment that connect to extending human healthspan and lifespan.<p><a href=\"http://genopharmix.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;genopharmix.com</a><p>@genopharmix<p>genopharmix@gmail.com","time":1414853867,"type":"comment"}
