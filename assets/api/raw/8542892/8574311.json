REMOTE and VISA are cool.<p>I&#x27;m Software Architect here and I&#x27;m looking for a person to complement my team of 2 other engineers. We build and use APIs to integrate modern web&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;native apps with legacy back-end systems (Cobol from 90&#x27;s; C# from 00&#x27;s). Those APIs are then consumed by external customers, contractors and internal separate web-team. Besides APIs we build and manage ESB to connect those legacy systems with each other.<p>My team does Continuous Delivery to respond to ever-changing priorities. Test-Driven Development gives us sanity and sleep at night.<p>Being big believers in SOA and EIP, most of our intra-team collaboration is about negotiating API contracts. Implementation of each service&#x2F;component is mostly left to an individual developer.<p>Ideal candidate should feel comfortable with Microsoft stack (i.e. Windows servers, IIS, SqlServer, and C#) and be proficient with OSS products (e.g. Linux, PHP, Java, PostgreSQL, and MySQL).<p>If you are interested, please shoot me an email to dzmitry.pletnikau@unicity.com","time":1415389817,"type":"comment"}
