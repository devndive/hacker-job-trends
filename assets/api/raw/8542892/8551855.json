We measure how busy places are, what people do, how fast cars go, and much more. We offer that data to developers, citizens, cities, and retailers, radically changing the way they interact with the physical world.<p>At the core we are a bunch of PhDs developing proprietary computer vision algorithms. Come join us if you&#x27;re tired of product-driven social media and advertising startups and instead want to work in a truly technology-driven environment.<p>Full-Stack Engineers (<a href=\"https://jobs.lever.co/placemeter/0c7862ed-9a83-4c50-ba16-74bf9b38b493\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;placemeter&#x2F;0c7862ed-9a83-4c50-ba16-74b...</a>): Build web apps, services and APIs on a Python&#x2F;Django&#x2F;MySQL&#x2F;Cassandra stack. We have hard challenges both in the frontend (think data visualization) and in the backend (we are generating a LOT of data).<p>Computer Vision Engineers (<a href=\"https://jobs.lever.co/placemeter/70be8dcf-e48e-4b9f-8c81-a06782930f39\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;placemeter&#x2F;70be8dcf-e48e-4b9f-8c81-a06...</a>): Develop the next generation of our real-time video processing algorithms which work at a scale that you&#x27;ll encounter in few other places. Strong C++ skills required and a background in computer vision (MS or PhD) preferred.","time":1415033894,"type":"comment"}
