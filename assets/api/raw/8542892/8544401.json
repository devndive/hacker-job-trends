Using google doc, sms or even email is strictly illegal because those tools aren’t built with patient security in mind. On top of being highly inefficient, managing critical information in a high-speed environment using paper literally kills patients. (400 000 patients <i>every year</i>, just in the US, die from miscommunication errors between doctors).<p>That’s why we built Listrunner: We bring project management from the modern world into a beautiful HIPAA compliant app. Think Asana for doctors.<p>About you:<p><pre><code>  - You have a few iOS apps under your belt.\n  - You have an eye for design and want to create a delightful experience.\n  - You can jump in and help crafting html, css and javascript.\n  - You’re a team player with startup experience.\n</code></pre>\nContact us at contact@listrunnerapp.com<p>Learn more about listrunner at <a href=\"http://www.listrunnerapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.listrunnerapp.com</a>","time":1414872185,"type":"comment"}
