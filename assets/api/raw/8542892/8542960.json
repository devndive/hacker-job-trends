We have a few open positions in the SW team:<p>- I manage the preprocessor group here and we&#x27;re looking to add a developer to help implement the next generation preprocessor (C++ development of a GUI product with 3D graphics using Qt on Windows &amp; Linux). The job description lists a senior role with 5-7 years experience required, but I&#x27;d definitely be open to considering a more junior candidate:<p><a href=\"http://exa.com/senior-software-engineer---graphical-preprocessor-development-c--.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;exa.com&#x2F;senior-software-engineer---graphical-preproce...</a><p>- Another manager here is putting together a team to build a new product to serve as a single high-level entry point that will help users manage the workflow involved with our various engineering software products. At the moment, I believe he&#x27;s looking at more senior candidates who would be able to play a key role in architecture decisions and help to build the team moving forward.<p><a href=\"http://exa.com/senior-sotware-engineerssoftware-engineers---application-development-c---(new-product-team).html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;exa.com&#x2F;senior-sotware-engineerssoftware-engineers---...</a><p>We have other software positions listed on our website but these are the two that we&#x27;re recruiting aggressively at the moment.","time":1414848713,"type":"comment"}
