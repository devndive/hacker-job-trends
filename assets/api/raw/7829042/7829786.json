We respect each other. We work in small batches. We max out the RAM in our laptops. We drink coffee on Monday mornings and classic cocktails on Friday afternoons. We try to be cutting edge without getting caught up in meaningless buzzwords and flaky vaporware.  We use effective methodologies without being dogmatic or cargo-culty.<p>What are we looking for?<p>That depends. What do you have to bring? We&#x27;re staffing up an entirely new team with a flexible and changing set of technologies, so we&#x27;re not rigid in specific job requirements. We just want talented people who care about making great software in an enjoyable and sustainable way. If that&#x27;s you, please email westlake.robots@gmail.com or contact me directly. Contact info is in my profile.<p>Where are we?<p>Our office is in Seattle. As the team is still forming, we&#x27;re hesitant to add the extra complexity of working with non-local talent at this time. My hope is that we&#x27;ll eventually become a geographically dispersed team, but we&#x27;re limiting our search to local talent right now. I have <i>no idea</i> if we can provide relocation assistance, but if you&#x27;re thinking of moving out here, let me know.","time":1401641076,"type":"comment"}
