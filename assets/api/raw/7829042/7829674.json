Existing formats are drawn out; we can be informationally dense and fast-paced. We&#x27;ll include a few relevant figures; we&#x27;ll also add footnotes, equations, and primary literarure citations for those that want to pause and do their own further exploration.<p>A perfect description of our demographic is HN--educated adults who might not actually be pursuing the field we&#x27;re covering but have a ton of interest in science. This market also includes advanced college and high school students that likewise share the same level of interest.<p>The lectures can be broad surveys or deep coverage of a particular area of research or discovery.\nWe&#x27;re going to fund filming about 3 videos, film them here in Atlanta, and then test the market for fit (ie. &quot;Show HN&quot;). If the market demands a less &quot;smart&quot; or info-dense video, we&#x27;ll probably abandon the project. Our goal is to fill the perceived lack of advanced material, not clone the existing formats.<p>bt at brand dot io","time":1401639454,"type":"comment"}
