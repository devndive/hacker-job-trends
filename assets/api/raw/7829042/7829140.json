Do you want your code to effect 6,000,000 people a day?<p>Qubit is personalising the web, and we need more engineers to work on filling the demand. From collecting our data, to developing cutting-edge visualisation tools to finding compelling means for other developers to consume your work, the life of a engineer is varied and full of joy!<p>We&#x27;re well looked after here in our Soho office, with a fully stocked kitchen (that you barely need to use, since we are on top of the foodie Berwick St market), a dedicated Chief Lifestyle Officer and a culture of getting shit done. The best brands in the world use our products and we want the best engineers to be creating them!<p>If you breathe Javascript, live on the command line and can create a quadrocopter from scratch, then you&#x27;ll fit in here and we want to hear from you.<p>Drop us a line at careers+HN@qubitproducts.com, telling us a bit about yourself!","time":1401630936,"type":"comment"}
