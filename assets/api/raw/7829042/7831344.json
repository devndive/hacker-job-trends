For us this means a design-oriented and engineering-conscious approach based on clarity, coherence, and simplicity. We build innovation software which empowers members of an organization to contribute to the life and growth of that organization.<p>There are currently two roles that HN readers might be interested in!<p>1. Lead Application Developer<p>This is a pretty broad server-side development role for someone of a senior or lead level. Part of this role is supporting our existing web application and API which is built on the LAMP stack (Zend framework), but we hope the role can also be flexible and future looking: from extending the application (not necessarily with PHP) to building whole new apps against the API.<p>If you&#x27;re interested: <a href=\"http://www.kindlingapp.com/jobs/lead-application-developer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kindlingapp.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;lead-application-developer&#x2F;</a><p>2. Passionate QA Engineer<p>We need someone who can do more than click around our software and reporting bugs. This is the ideal role for someone who likes to figure out new and exciting ways to break software. You&#x27;ll get to know the software from top to bottom and be instrumental in designing tests (automated and manual) as new features are developed.<p><a href=\"http://www.kindlingapp.com/jobs/passionate-qa-engineer-full-time/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kindlingapp.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;passionate-qa-engineer-full-...</a>","time":1401670395,"type":"comment"}
