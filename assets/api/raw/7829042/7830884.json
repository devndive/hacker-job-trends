We serve billions of transactions per day with super low latency through our online advertising platform.  At that scale, every contribution to our platform can have a huge impact.<p>We hack on C, Scala, Rails, Redis, Hadoop, HBase and Postgres.  We&#x27;re likely to get into Spark and Storm in the near future.  We don&#x27;t expect you to be an expert in any of these technologies.  In fact, I joined the team as a full-fledged .NET guy.  More than anything we&#x27;re looking for the right kind of can-do folks who thrive on building solid systems.<p>We offer a competitive salary, paid lunch, medical&#x2F;dental, and uncapped vacation.<p>Maybe you&#x27;ve been wanting to learn Scala. Maybe you&#x27;ve tinkered with Kafka&#x2F;Storm on a few EC2 instances but never had a chance to work with a ton of data. We want you. You&#x27;ll be joining a sharp team with a strong appetite for progress.<p>I&#x27;m one of the engineers, and I&#x27;d be happy to chat about our team even if you don&#x27;t have a resume or consider yourself actively looking for a new gig.  If you&#x27;d prefer to jump directly into the HR channel, I can connect you with the right folks.  Email david.larsen@connexity.com.","time":1401660868,"type":"comment"}
