Downtown office location; no remote work.<p>We have an otherwise unadvertised full time position (3 month contract to start) open that I think is the coolest job ever: We&#x27;d like to hire a Data Evangelist; someone who looks at the reams of data flowing in from websites like Sportsnet.ca, TodaysParent.com, NextIssue.ca and 680News.com and humanizes it by finding two or three key things those brands can act on to better meet their audience&#x27;s needs.<p>The candidate would have lived through multiple website projects and would be able to suggest how to further instrument a website with analytics to capture data to help drive growth. They&#x27;d also have strong communication skills, as they&#x27;d be shifting focus month to month to try to spend time with lots of our brand websites and would meet with senior leaders of those brands to talk over their findings.<p>If you or someone you know is interested, drop me a line at sully.syed@rci.rogers.com . You&#x27;d be coming to work at 350 Bloor St. E for a division that acts like a startup-within-a-company, with people who aren&#x27;t afraid to experiment and are trying to forment a data-driven culture.","time":1401631164,"type":"comment"}
