We&#x27;re now home to 45000 stores and plan to grow 3x over the next year. We care deeply about user experience and want to make e-commerce as accessible as starting a blog. As a result, more than 80% of our store owners would recommend us to a friend.<p>At Tictail, you&#x27;ll be building something that helps people all over the world grow their own business from their passion. You’ll work with some of the best people you’ve ever met, making ambitious things, with a great amount of responsibility. Our stack is Python (Tornado, Flask), CoffeeScript&#x2F;JavaScript (Node, React, Backbone), Redis, RabbitMQ and Elasticsearch. We host our infrastructure on AWS and manage it using Chef.<p>Because Tictail is nothing without our colleagues and our culture, we might not match your expectations of a normal recruitment process. We will definitely want to figure out if you’re smart and get things done, but more importantly we want to figure out if we click.<p>If this sounds interesting, get in touch at jobs+hn@tictail.com and tell us a few things about yourself and a project you&#x27;ve enjoyed working on.
