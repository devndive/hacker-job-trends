Researching people is a complex problem: we sift through, analyze, and manipulate data into powerful insights (i.e. what are they passionate about, what do you have in common?). CNBC called us “One of the world’s most promising new companies” and SXSW selected us as an Accelerator Finalist.<p>We’ve built Charlie to research people at massive scale, using the latest Ruby on Rails stack with MongoDB, Redis, Sidekiq, and hosted in an elastic cloud farm. We write code with agility and have a tight process where anyone on the team can deploy to production at any time, without approval. We thoroughly test our code, though we’re not strict TDD. We have a small dev team where everyone loves to code, are passionate about Charlie, and push-and learn from each other on a daily basis.<p>This is your opportunity to join an early-stage company that’s making moves.
