It&#x27;s what&#x27;s perhaps most broken about banks and we&#x27;re helping to fix it. Our customers are tier-1 financial institutions and large multinationals. We are currently looking for Senior Engineers in London.<p>We work predominantly with Python, Django, JavaScript, React, and Docker. We are also moving towards exciting technologies like Go, and GraphQL. Our infrastructure is backed by Kubernetes, Hadoop, ElasticSearch, Terraform, and Amazon Web Services. Experience in any of these is a plus but not required, however, we are looking for strong Python and&#x2F;or React skills. We have two projects with over 1k stars on GitHub (one just broke 4k <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arachnys\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arachnys</a>).

We have a relentless focus on quality of delivery.<p>Drop me a line if any questions.<p>Email daniel@arachnys.com to apply, linking to your GitHub or some other code that you think tells a good story about you.","time":1533151807,"type":"comment"}
