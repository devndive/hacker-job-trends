As just one example, the Heart Safe Motherhood program uses our platform to text postpartum mothers about their blood pressure for 10 days, allowing us to catch mothers at risk for preeclampsia long before they would otherwise show up in an ambulance.<p>As we scale from research to clinical and commercial use, the Software Developers on our team play a critical role in extending and supporting the platform - designing and building new features to enable novel patient engagement strategies, improving the user interface for our patients and providers, and troubleshooting issues affecting our users.<p>This position requires strong technical ability to design and build web applications and APIs, clear communication with team members and users to deeply understand user needs, and creativity to solve issues and meet requirements while paying off rather than accruing technical debt.<p>Bachelors degree and minimum 3 years experience in web development required. We use mostly PHP and Vue.js so experience in either of those is a plus, but we will consider candidates with experience in other backend or frontend frameworks. An interest in medicine, research, and&#x2F;or patient engagement is always great - we are an excited and engaged team who loves what we do and the impact that we can make.<p>Email me at [my HN username]@waytohealth.org with your resume or any questions - I&#x27;m happy to chat.","time":1533153812,"type":"comment"}
