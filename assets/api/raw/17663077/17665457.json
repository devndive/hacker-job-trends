Our mission is to re-imagine the way the world reads. We are one of the oldest YC startups (YC â€™06), operating one of the largest Ruby on Rails sites.<p>We&#x27;re looking for senior data engineers (4+ years of experience) with experience in Spark and Scala. We have multiple projects leveraging our cluster to support our recommendations, search and other areas of the product.<p>We are also looking for engineering managers that want to lead the work we do on Search,  Recommendations and Web&#x2F;front end sides. We have growing teams that would benefit from the expertise of an experienced manager with solid technical background in one of the areas mentioned.<p>We are a small team which means you can have a ton of impact and bring in your own ideas. Scribd has a very friendly, engineering-driven company culture with great perks for employees. We are ambitious but at the same time we value a good work life balance. In general we care way more about your personality and hacking skills than what languages you&#x27;ve used so far. We have hired a bunch of people from these threads, including myself.
