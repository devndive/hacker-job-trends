Our mission is to promote transparency and smarter decision-making within this emerging ecosystem by building a free, global, and open-source data library for cryptoasset projects.<p>We think crypto is great, but there are way too many scams. We want to give investors the tools to separate the wheat from the chaff, and apply new models for open source contributions and self-regulation to financial services along the way.<p>We are looking for a few talented team members:<p>- Infrastructure engineer to help design, architect, and build our scalable data systems. Experience working with blockchain data is great, but this will be a boring old low-latency, high capacity centralized database for the foreseeable future.<p>- Web UI&#x2F;UX Designer to take ownership of the UI&#x2F;UX vision for our product in its entirety, and drive it from ideation to implementation. Our standard is &#x27;so easy a regulator can grock it&#x27;, so you&#x27;ll have your work cut out for you.<p>- Research analyst to create thematic and macro focused reports for the cryptoasset industry, and help launch our  curated content products.<p>This is an ideal opportunity if you are interested in crypto, but turned off by some of the excesses in the industry. We are an experienced, mission driven team looking to drive the asset class forward. Our team has a mix of startup and institutional experience at Microsoft, Palantir, Bloomberg, Tower Research, Digital Currency Group, Coindesk, JP Morgan, S&amp;P, and the SEC.<p>Please send your resume and a quick note introducing yourself to hector@messari.io<p>angel.co&#x2F;messari&#x2F;jobs","time":1533143246,"type":"comment"}
