Instead of the conventional (and ineffective) format of professional development for educators—filling an auditorium for a day of sleep-inducing lectures—BetterLesson supports teachers for the entire school year with regular, 1:1, virtual coaching.  We match each teacher with a world-class coach and then leverage our technology to study actual classroom performance, to suggest customized teaching strategies, to quantitatively measure impact on student learning, and to continuously improve teaching practice through rapid iteration.  This process leads to off-the-charts teacher love (our data shows teachers love BetterLesson more than Apple users love their iPhones), high administrator engagement, and, most importantly, dramatic teacher and student growth.<p>To learn more about this position please visit <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;betterlesson.bamboohr.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;view.php?id=29\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;betterlesson.bamboohr.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;view.php?id=29</a> or email matthew.ogorman@betterlesson.com","time":1533146306,"type":"comment"}
