We started two years ago and have been growing rapidly, becoming the largest volunteering platform in the Netherlands. We&#x27;re on a mission to make volunteering more effective, fun and impactful, and engage everyone with the causes they care about. We are a social enterprise and have chosen not to charge charities for the collaboration and coordination software we build for them, so we make money through a company volunteering product where we work with companies like Microsoft, Atlassian and Red bull.<p>We are looking for software developers to join us in building our core platform (React&#x2F;Redux&#x2F;Node&#x2F;TypeScript) as well as develop other volunteering products we are developing for partners and governments. We&#x27;re a young and hungry team of learners who are driven by a shared mission to make the world a better place.<p>If that sounds like a place you&#x27;d like to work, shoot me an email me at david@deedmob.com (We&#x27;re also hiring for other positions)","time":1533195143,"type":"comment"}
