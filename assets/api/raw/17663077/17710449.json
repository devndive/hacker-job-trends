We&#x27;re currently particularly looking for Vue.js developers work on-site in NYC (which is unusual for us; most of our work is remote.)<p>About us: we do web, app, and (increasingly) blockchain development for a panoply of clients ranging from Fortune 500 to brand-new startups. Right now the distribution is roughly 50-50. We prefer people with a reasonable amount of experience under their belt, but there are always exceptions. And we pay well.<p>If interested, email: jobs@happyfuncorp.com","time":1533673746,"type":"comment"}
