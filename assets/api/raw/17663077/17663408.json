What youâ€™ll find here is that our vibe is completely different from what you may see in a traditional office. There are no cubicles or seating plan, instead, we have teams of people working side-by-side creating something exceptional for our customers.\nWe use a range of technologies to get the job done: JavaScript and Babel (ES2015-2017) coupled with Webpack, React, Redux and other libraries to provide a modern, easy to use Javascript toolchain and smooth Developer Experience. A central Design System is used for styling and hosts shared components, while our RESTful APIs are built with Node.js powering our custom services. Quality is a primary concern and we test our applications at multiple levels with QA and Product Owners embedded within teams.<p>Take a look at our open positions: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;labs.telus.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;labs.telus.com&#x2F;careers</a>","time":1533137471,"type":"comment"}
