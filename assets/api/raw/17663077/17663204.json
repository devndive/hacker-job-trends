Our sensing module is installed in a corner and works with smart lights like Philips Hue to map a room and its lighting. With this information we automatically generate a range of lighting scenes for your favorite activities. It’s like having your very own lighting designer! We can also detect presence so your lights will turn on when you enter a room, and only turn off once you leave. You can also set up your lights to change depending on what’s going on in a room. For example, you can set your lights to fade into a reading mode when you sit in your favorite reading chair at night.<p>Job Description\nAs a Mobile Engineer at Dahlia Lights, you will be a core member of the engineering team defining and building a new kind of lighting product that will bring great joy to people’s lives.
