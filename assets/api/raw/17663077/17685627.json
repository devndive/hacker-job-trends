I really enjoy fixing&#x2F;improving existing web apps more than creating something from scratch. Looking to offer maintenance-only service to small-ish teams. The benefits I see are:\n1. In-house devs will be free to work on new projects rather than fixing old issues<p>2. I can offer off-hours maintenance so this might be helpful in some cases<p>3. Team augmentation - fill in for a dev if they are unavailable (eg. vacation)<p>5. Same timezone availability(EST&#x2F;PST work hours)and quick turnaround<p>6. Available by email, slack, phone<p>I&#x27;m located in Ontario, Canada.<p>Rate<p>- CAD$100&#x2F;hr<p>- CAD$700&#x2F;day<p>Email hi@greenpine.co to discuss your projects :)<p>Languages: JS, PHP, Python, SQL","time":1533363151,"type":"comment"}
