Engine development is more focused on solving the problems in the hot path of transaction processing whereas front-end development handles customer facing tools and analytics (it should be noted frontend is cross functional and owns their whole stack including the backend APIs, storage and orchestration).<p>Our stack includes Go for backend APIs, Angular 6 on the frontend, Kubernettes for deployment, Postgres for relational data storage and various non-relational datastores such as Kafka and etcd.<p>You might be a backend or frontend developer, a bit of both or someone wishing to move into a full-stack role after focusing more on front&#x2F;backend in the past. Either way we&#x27;d like to hear from you. Drop me an email at diego@fraugster.com or see our jobs page (we are currently updating our job descriptions so don&#x27;t worry that there is no frontend position listed): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fraugster.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fraugster.com&#x2F;jobs</a>","time":1533197995,"type":"comment"}
