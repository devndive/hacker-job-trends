Self-driving cars to ease our commutes, delivery robots to reinvent local commerce, and construction robots to make building faster and safer... they&#x27;re all coming.<p>Our mission is to foster a thriving ecosystem of hundreds of innovative robotics companies as they solve an unimaginable array of important problems. To succeed, they are going to need access to the same quality of development tools and data infrastructure that made the web and mobile revolutions possible, but built to their needs.<p>That&#x27;s where Raven[Ops] comes in.<p>Each of our customer&#x27;s robots can generate 1-7TB of data per hour. Our first challenge is triaging that data flow. At that data scale we have fascinating challenges with even simple tasks like aggregation, transmission and storage. We are working on many novel ways to work with and process robotics data, both real-time and post-processed and are in the process of filing several patents.<p>We&#x27;ve recently raised $3.5M led by Accel and are looking for several go backend engineers to join the team. Our stack consists of Go (golang), gRPC, AWS, Docker, and React.<p>If any of this sounds interesting, feel free to reach out to me directly, randall@raven-ops.com (but please apply to the link).
