In Europe, we focus on commercial insurance, where we use a broad set of machine learning tools, natural language processing, and data visualisation to solve business problems. Data is critical to our decision making process, where it influences pricing, risk assessment, fraud, claims, customer acquisition and others.

You will be working with a diverse team (12 and growing) using the latest technologies, while working closely with experts with a vast knowledge in each specific domain, and strong corporate sponsorship. The Data Science team has a largely flat structure, and you will have the freedom to solve problems as you see fit, to really make a mark within the company.\nStack-wise, we currently use the PyData stack (pandas, sklearn, statsmodels, etc), Kubernetes, Terraform, Gitlab (and Gitlab CI), Bitbucket, Superset (and some Tableau still).
