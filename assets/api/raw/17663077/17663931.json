If you haven&#x27;t heard unikernels are super light-weight (ours weighs in around 200k + application) secure (single process - no popping a shell and wget&#x27;ng your way to freedom) virtual machines that are faster than containers and in some cases bare metal. We&#x27;ve been building out our own unikernel runtime lately and have other non-public projects we are working on. We&#x27;re funded, have paying customers, and doing all sorts of interesting low level stuff.<p>If you miss hacking in assembly or haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to do what you learned in school you know you belong here.<p>Location: We&#x27;re only filling full-time on-site (SF, CA) roles at the moment.<p>Sponsor: We can sponsor or do transfers for the right people. Note: For H1 transfers we&#x27;ve had RFEs so ymmv. F1s are going to be hard too cause we prefer candidates with at least a few years under their belt.<p>Interview Process: 20-30min Phone Screen, 1-2hr onsite (comp. sci. fundamentals a must, *nix skills a must) - offer same day<p>Stack: Go, C, ASM<p>Also - I know this post is heavily geared towards engineers (it is HN) but if you happen to be a SDR&#x2F;AE we&#x27;re hiring those too!<p>Email us (ian@) or ping here.","time":1533140369,"type":"comment"}
