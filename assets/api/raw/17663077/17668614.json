We are a two-sided marketplace connecting consumers to their local merchants to make the purchasing of goods and service more efficient. Our initial product focuses on creating a social food ordering experience that allows users to pre-order take-out at their local restaurants. We make it easy to place group orders and have a coworker deliver your lunch or coffee right to your desk. Our value-add for merchants is to increase their order volume and repeat business. Additionally we provide merchants with valuable insights into their local customer behaviour, allowing for highly targeted local marketing campaigns.<p>We just closed a $70M Series C round and are looking to double our engineering team from 20 to 40. We are mostly focusing on intermediate and senior talent. Come help us digitize local commerce!<p>Our glassdoor: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.glassdoor.ca&#x2F;Reviews&#x2F;Ritual-Reviews-E1195050.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.glassdoor.ca&#x2F;Reviews&#x2F;Ritual-Reviews-E1195050.htm</a><p>You can apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ritual.co&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ritual.co&#x2F;careers</a> or email me directly at andrew.potapov@ritual.co","time":1533173605,"type":"comment"}
