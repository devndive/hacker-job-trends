In this context, we are looking for highly motivated developers to help us extend our product base and grow internationally.<p>At Legalstart, we strive to improve our technical skills, that means challenging the status quo (we shipped a small blockchain-based product in production), continuously improving our practices (we introduced Haskell and ReasonML in our codebase), staying close to the local community (hosting meetups, conferences)â€¦ Also, Legalstart engineers develop a strong ownership of the product itself, and we really value their personal growth.<p>Apply there if you feel up to the experience!<p>* front-end developer: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;smrtr.io&#x2F;4NUKgA\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;smrtr.io&#x2F;4NUKgA</a><p>* Python developer: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;smrtr.io&#x2F;ao_QDQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;smrtr.io&#x2F;ao_QDQ</a>","time":1533291430,"type":"comment"}
