We&#x27;re growing our software team of currently eight engineers (including myself) and three QA engineers to support the rapid adoption of our technology and release of three new novel products this year.<p>Scientists are really excited about our technology as evidenced by the company seeing $71 million in revenue in 2017, which was more than double our revenue in 2016. We&#x27;re working hard to continue this trend this year. Last month we released a novel product that allows scientists to discover tumor heterogeneity and evolution with unprecedented resolution.<p>You can find out more about our massively parallel pipelines as well as our visualization software at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;</a>.
