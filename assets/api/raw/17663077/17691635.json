We train people who want to either:<p>- Have a job in a tech company<p>- Have tons of impact by going alone on their own startup or doing ‘good’<p>We make sure we fulfill those two customer needs by giving them the best environment to produce an impressive portfolio project.<p>The more we talk to companies interviewing today, the more apparent it is: A portfolio project is decisive when making hiring judgments. Jeremy Howard recommends it. Andrew Ng recommends it. Why? It’s far better at discriminating talent than any other proxy (CVs don’t work; pedigree doesn’t work; puzzles don’t work). DLR focus is to help you write the best portfolio project you could; in that sense, it’s like a writer’s retreat, where one goes to finish your masterpiece novel. We use online videos to cover the theory, but focus on project-based, peer-learning methods that are completely hands on. When you come out of the door, you should be holding a project that proves you can write damn good code and makes you unstoppable in interviews… or an extremely desirable partner for social impact projects or startups.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deeplearningretreat.com&#x2F;work-at-dlr&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deeplearningretreat.com&#x2F;work-at-dlr&#x2F;</a>","time":1533481227,"type":"comment"}
