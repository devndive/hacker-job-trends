We have hundreds of Linux servers located at tens of financial exchanges around the world, and we design &#x2F; build &#x2F; maintain the entire software stack which runs on them. We&#x27;re not serving up adverts, or worrying about user acquisition metrics, or building software for a faceless third party - everything we build is for our own use, and we use what we build to trade over 150 billion dollars worth of assets every day, all in a completely automated manner. You should be familiar with modern C++, interested in pushing hardware to its limits, and not afraid of mathematical formulae. No prior financial experience is necessary - we&#x27;re happy to teach you that part.<p>careers@xtxmarkets.com","time":1533298601,"type":"comment"}
