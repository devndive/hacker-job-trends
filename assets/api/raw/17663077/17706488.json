We are currently developing our Audition Pro desktop application, which allows a recorded stereo music track to be automatically re-edited to fit the narrative of a video. We are looking for a mid-level or senior Qt&#x2F;QML C++ person to help bring our prototype to market.<p>The code base is new, so mostly modern C++14. Qt&#x2F;QML, Mac&#x2F;Windows&#x2F;Linux, Boost, FFMPEG. Experience with backend technologies and Google Cloud would be a plus.<p>We prefer on-site, but if you feel your skills are a good fit, then please do contact us. Remote is possible, but would have to include a couple of months on-site first.<p>Please contact us by email at join@mxxmusic.com.","time":1533649466,"type":"comment"}
