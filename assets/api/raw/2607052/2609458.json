Since December 2010, when Route 53 launched, we have been working hard to add new features (<a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2582674\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2582674</a>), make the service easy to use, and scale our systems. In that time, we've had a big impact on the DNS space, attracting some major customers and filling a gap in the market.  Our team is small, nimble, and crazy smart.  Working on Route 53 you'll learn <i>tons</i> about networking, DNS, operating a tier-0 service, and growing a business.<p>We've got lots of exciting plans for this year and next and we're looking for developers and managers to help us turn them into reality.
