(Please forgive the double post, didn't expect to see two separate who's hiring threads.)<p>2 weeks ago I quit my job in NY to work on my new startup, Styloot (name still a work in progress). Our goal is to build a search engine for fashion. We have a nice office in Model Colony. Currently we are 10 people (CEO, CTO, adviser, web designer, 6 content creators), with lots of work to be done and not enough of us to go around.<p>We have room for all sorts of people - our main focus right now is on design/user experience, web development and machine learning.<p>We care a lot about attitude - if you want to build your own startup someday, we probably want to talk to you. We care far less about grades, whether you went to IIT, or whether you've used django before.<p>Why you should work for us: you'll work very hard on difficult problems, you'll be a vastly better developer/designer when you are finished, and you might even become very rich.<p>Contact info is in my profile.","time":1306937060,"type":"comment"}
