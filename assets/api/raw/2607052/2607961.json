We're an engineering consultancy in downtown Palo Alto (considering an office in SF very soon though, so if that interests you, let us know). Notable projects include the Aliph Jawbone headset, the Pure Digital Flip (before it was acquired by Cisco). We're looking for thought leaders who will help us bring agile development to physical products in support of our clients' customer development efforts.<p><a href=\"http://mindtribe.com/jobs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mindtribe.com/jobs/</a><p>I'm our Director of Software Engineering and, despite the requirements listed on our website, I'm specifically looking for enthusiastic embedded developers with strong C skills, test-driven development discipline, and agile planning experience--regardless of degree or pedigree. And the agile experience/mindset is more important than intimate knowledge of C. If this excites you, contact me at hn@mindtribe.com.","time":1306945130,"type":"comment"}
