This involves Django in the cloud (and python, obviously), mobile apps, and solving some very interesting problems. Your work will directly improve the lives of tens of thousands of people on a daily basis. What we currently do is just the first step in our world domination plan ;)<p>We are lean, cash flow positive and growing fast. We don't care whether you went to an ivy league school, but do care whether you are passionate about what you do and willing to learn what you don't know.<p>We don't do traditional (dumb) interviews. We'll chat first but I promise not to ever ask you a syntax question. It'll be more like a discussion between geeks. If it looks like we gel, we'd like to pay you to come work with us on the actual product for some time (hours, days - whatever you can). Did I mention we'll pay you, even if you work with us for just 2 hours? Because we believe, foremost, in doing the right thing.<p>Email aj@ridecell.com with your resume, questions or a note.","time":1306942299,"type":"comment"}
