We are language-agnostic, but would like someone who knows at least one general-purpose language (C++, C#, Java, etc.) and one get-it-done scripting language (Python, PERL, etc.) well enough to create rock-solid, production-quality systems.<p>Strong financial mathematics skills are obviously a plus, but those can be taught (and we are happy to teach you). What cannot be taught, and what we seek most, is an intense passion for programming and the desire to tackle the types of difficult problems found in the financial domain. If this sounds interesting to you, please email hropportunity1@gmail.com (sorry for the throwaway address, but for various reasons we cannot publish our actual contact info). Or, if you prefer, contact me directly through my HN profile.","time":1307728794,"type":"comment"}
