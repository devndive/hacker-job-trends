Youâ€™ll be building APIs, creating reusable components, and working with your colleagues to make iterative improvements.<p>* Our open source web application framework for developing information rich applications extends from a low level search engine up to high level UI components, along with everything in the middle.<p>* Our work is a bit different. We went to the effort of developing our own platform because nothing else could do what we needed. Our platform is mature and incredibly effective at building applications to manage semi-structured information.<p>(...more on the job ad...)<p>QA developer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.haplo-services.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;qa-developer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.haplo-services.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;qa-developer</a><p>* We build highly customised applications with lots of business logic on top of integrated products, using a toolkit of components. Automated tests for everything is not economically viable, so our tools and APIs have to ensure quality without automated tests for the majority of the customisations.<p>* This isn&#x27;t a testing job. The idea is to minimise the need for testing.<p>* You&#x27;ll be an integral part of a development team who really care about quality and good design, advocating for continual improvements and shaping our development practises.","time":1517501857,"type":"comment"}
