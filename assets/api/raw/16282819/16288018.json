We’re an enterprise technology company, but our product affects the most important purchase most people will make in their lifetime—their home. For homebuyers, our product means a clear, guided, and stress-free path to a new home. For lenders, it means modern, easy-to-use tools that let employees spend their time helping customers, rather than on repetitive, manual tasks. By aligning and modernizing this archaic industry, we believe everybody wins.<p>We’re looking for someone who is a true problem-solver at heart. You don’t shy away from new challenges; the harder the problem, the better. We’re motivated by the fact that our product doesn’t just affect the lives of a few people in the Bay Area—it affects people all over the world.<p>We just moved into a new space in September located in the heart of the Financial District in SF, two of the top banks in the US are our customers, VC backed by Greylock and Andreessen Horowitz, and ready to explore consumer finance.
