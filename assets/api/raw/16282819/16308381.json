You are excited by improving the scalability of the platform and implementing new features. We are always creating and updating features like queues, IVRs, call recording, and voicemail. Basically, it covers all the things you would expect from a telephony platform and more. The platform integrates with third parties so we need to expose things that happen on our platform through an API that is under active and continuous development.","time":1517834068,"type":"comment"}
