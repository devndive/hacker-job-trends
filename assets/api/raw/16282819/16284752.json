We&#x27;re hiring and several of our other front-end, back-end and data teams are as well.  Primary tech stack is React + Ruby on Rails (may be moving some into Elixer soon).  Data team uses Python.<p>Outreach is a sales engagement platform.  Both the company and the engineering team are growing rapidly.  The engineering org is split into small teams of 3-6, with really diverse backgrounds and a culture of collaboration and learning.<p>Individual projects each have their own challenges to work through.  For my team a lot of them arise from the many possible points of failure in executing a call, several of which are external to our platform.  We have to get creative to ensure we can provide a solid customer experience under those constraints.<p>Looking for mid-level and senior engineers, with strong sense of ownership, dedication to great customer experience, and desire to collaborate.<p>Unlimited vacation and sick days, competitive salary, excellent parental leave policy, healthy work-life balance, free snacks, etc. Feel free to either reach out directly or apply on the website: seth.johnson@outreach.io || <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.outreach.io&#x2F;company&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.outreach.io&#x2F;company&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a>","time":1517512107,"type":"comment"}
