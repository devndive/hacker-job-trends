CALA reduces that down to a few weeks, from design to garment in your hands.<p>We’ve built the “Adobe Suite” for apparel designers, but with a proprietary Zara-like global supply chain built in. We enable any company of any size to design, develop, and produce garments faster than has ever been possible.<p>---<p>We&#x27;re a small team and hiring our first engineer. You&#x27;ll be working across our whole stack (web, backend services, iOS, and more) — mostly TypeScript&#x2F;JavaScript&#x2F;React&#x2F;Redux but a couple of other things too. You&#x27;ll be helping define our team culture, technology choices, and roadmap, and be a key part of the next phase of our growth.<p>If this sounds exciting, email me at d@ca.la","time":1517501314,"type":"comment"}
