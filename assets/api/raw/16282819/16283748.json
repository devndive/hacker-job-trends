It&#x27;s SwiftDemand&#x27;s mission to both create a platform where everyone in the world receives a small amount of income on a daily basis and build a currency that is used for day to day transactions in the same way you would interact with Amazon or Apple Pay.<p>In the month of January we have continued to grow very quickly from less than 30,000 users to over 85,000. So far we have distributed 165 million Swifts and we have a marketplace with over 600 submitted products. At this time SwiftDemand is not funded, however we are looking to raise money in a presale and already have committed interest from over 900 people. The presale process likely to be completed within the next 2 months.<p>There are two potential options:\n1. We can begin talking now, and once SwiftDemand has concrete funding bring you on immediately following that.\n2. Start before the presale has completed and be given a larger stake in both the currency and the company.<p>Whitepaper: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;swiftdemand&#x2F;swiftprotocol\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;swiftdemand&#x2F;swiftprotocol</a><p>Other roles SwiftDemand will be hiring: Full Stack Engineer, Customer Support<p>If you are interested please email chris@swiftdemand.com","time":1517506217,"type":"comment"}
