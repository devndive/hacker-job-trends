We&#x27;ve started two new companies in the last year and we&#x27;re currently working on two more. The plan is to do this about four times a year.<p>We operate under a unique structure here. We bring in a few types of people -<p>EIR&#x27;s (disclosure: I am one of those here) These are typically people we believe can start a company and run it taking it the distance as founder&#x2F;CEO&#x27;s.<p>Company Builders - These are people who have a deep interest in joining a company very early (in the idea iteration phase) either as an early employee or a co-founder<p>HVF Core Staff - These are the people who help the companies coming out of HVF succeed.<p>So far we&#x27;ve seen Yelp, Affirm, Glow and Divvy Homes publicly announce their launch and as mentioned there are a couple more in the pipeline.<p>One of the major bonuses about being here is getting to work with brilliant people.<p>Ben Jun who runs HVF is literally the guy who discovered a side channel attack that allowed people to exploit the voltage output of a Credit Card chip to decrypt the card number. Don&#x27;t worry he also helped fix it!<p>It&#x27;s an environment like no other I&#x27;ve been a part of and we&#x27;re constantly looking for smart people who love iterating on ideas to join us and help us build something real and meaningful.<p>It doesn&#x27;t hurt we get to hang out with people like Ben and Max on a regular basis too.<p>If this sounds interesting ping me and I&#x27;ll be happy to have you by or tell you more!<p>zach@hvflabs.com","time":1517531255,"type":"comment"}
