The company is in a very early stage so you get to have a real impact and build things from the ground-up. That being said, we do have the product up and running with a bunch of active users providing us constant feedback, as well as funding to pay reasonable salaries.<p>At PrompterAI we build a virtual assistant for people working in sales and account management. The information they need to keep up with is scattered around tons of different tools: LinkedIn, news, email, Slack, CRM, support ticketing system, intranet etc. Based on users&#x27; calendar, who they are meeting with and what the meetings are about, we filter and aggregate  relevant information from all those tools and compile it into a daily briefing package. It&#x27;s kind of like a virtual executive assistant that helps people to keep up with everything and making sure no balls get dropped.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, drop me a line at lauri (at) prompter.ai, happy to chat more :)","time":1517518313,"type":"comment"}
