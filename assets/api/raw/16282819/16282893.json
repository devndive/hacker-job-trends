We build the world&#x27;s biggest and fastest satellites, providing service to homes, business, airlines, and more. Our technology connects parents to children, soldiers to their commanders, and emergency responders to support lines, whether they&#x27;re in Dayton, OH or climbing the slopes of Denali.<p>We were founded in San Diego in 1986 by three engineers who sought to build the company they <i>wanted</i> to work for, and that emphasis on our employees continues to this day.  It sounds a little silly, but we still retain a lot of the beach town influence from that founding, this many years on.  Iâ€™ve been with the company for over seven years now (almost a decade if you count internships!), through a number of different projects and teams, and still love working here.<p>We opened a brand new Seattle office back in October, and are hiring for multiple positions:<p>* Data Architect - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2A61JKa\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2A61JKa</a><p>* Data Engineer - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2CxXWuF\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2CxXWuF</a><p>* Performance Engineer - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2CbKRmZ\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2CbKRmZ</a><p>* Software Engineer, Framework - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2CslIrP\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2CslIrP</a><p>Email stephan dot kemper at viasat.com, or apply online through <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.viasat.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;openings\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.viasat.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;openings</a>.<p>Candidates only; recruiter&#x2F;agency emails will be used only to train our spam filters :)","time":1517501271,"type":"comment"}
