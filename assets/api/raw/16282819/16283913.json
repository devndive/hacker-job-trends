We&#x27;re looking for a full-stack engineer and a backend architect to join our 5-person founding team here in Boston, MA. At this time we aren&#x27;t prepared to offer H1B&#x2F;Visa sponsorship or remote work.<p>JOB DESCRIPTION\nCurrently, we are working closely with our customers to rapidly prototype, build, and refine the Jellyfish platform. We are using a Django stack (Python 3, Django, Postgres) hosted on AWS, so experience with these technologies is a plus. We are also seeking to augment the team with someone with substantial experience with toolkits like scikit-learn.<p>ABOUT YOU\nIdeal candidates will have two or more years experience building software and a bachelor&#x27;s degree in a computer-science-adjacent field. We will also consider equivalent experience in lieu of a degree. Familiarity with building and bringing software to market is a huge plus. As we are an early-stage startup there is the standard caveat: we&#x27;re working quite hard to quickly bring this to market, so there will be a non-zero amount of unpredictability. The flip side of that is, of course, the opportunity to join an early-stage startup working on an interesting idea.<p>TECH STACK<p>Python (Django, NumPy), PostgreSQL, AWS, Nginx<p>COMPENSATION \nCompetitive salary plus equity grant<p>Email resumes to jobs [at] jelly.ai or you can contact me directly asm [at] jelly.ai with questions.","time":1517507305,"type":"comment"}
