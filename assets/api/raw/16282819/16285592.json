Applications including a pull request for an issue will be given priority consideration.<p>Official listing and more information: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hhmi-openhire.silkroad.com&#x2F;epostings&#x2F;index.cfm?fuseaction=app.jobinfo&amp;jobid=687&amp;company_id=16908\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hhmi-openhire.silkroad.com&#x2F;epostings&#x2F;index.cfm?fusea...</a><p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;catmaid&#x2F;catmaid\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;catmaid&#x2F;catmaid</a>\n[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aschampion&#x2F;diluvian\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aschampion&#x2F;diluvian</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.janelia.org&#x2F;lab&#x2F;cardona-lab\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.janelia.org&#x2F;lab&#x2F;cardona-lab</a>","time":1517517165,"type":"comment"}
