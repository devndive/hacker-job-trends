Mix together several teams, multiple marketing channels, a large product line, and a diverse customer base, and the data quickly becomes overwhelming.<p>Our goal is to use statistical and machine learning methods to find hidden issues and provide a shared workspace for resolving them (think sentry.io for e-commerce operations + beyond).<p>Who do we need? A couple experienced engineers to help build out our BE and FE infrastructure, e.g., a senior full-stack engineer (5+ years experience) and a FE engineer (3+ years&#x2F;React).<p>What are we built on? Go, Python, React, Proto3&#x2F;gRPC, Docker, Kubernetes, Postgres, Airflow, with more to come!<p>Want to learn more?
