The services making up this API run on a stack using docker, mysql, redis, and node.js.  The core need is for someone who is comfortable writing in a modern JS style (async&#x2F;await, unit and bdt, etc), who avoids slow and unsafe patterns with SQL, and who has some experience with docker, ssh, git, and so forth.<p>Familiarity with any of JSON Hypermedia, OAuth2, AWS administration, microservices, Ansible, Consul, or Jenkins is a plus.<p>The contract is expected to last 8-12 calendar weeks, though number of hours for each week may vary.  We plan to get started in February, so the decision process should be short.<p>As mentioned, we will be setting up a physical office in SC in 2018; for a developer located in the Upstate, this contract could lead into a FT position.<p>Please use careers.dev@referwell.com to ask questions or send your details for consideration.","time":1517504464,"type":"comment"}
