We&#x27;re open to talking to local developers of all levelsâ€”our main requirement is a willingness&#x2F;drive to learn rather than particular technical skills. To that end, if you are an experienced developer interested in picking up Ruby then that is also a possibility.<p>The system is a Rails 5 app which large companies use to gather anonymous feedback regarding their hiring process. We are still a very small team so there is plenty of opportunity to have an outsized impact on the value delivered by the system.<p>For more details or to arrange to drop by our Bath office for a coffee, please contact me (Stefan) at stefan@mysteryapplicant.com","time":1517513183,"type":"comment"}
