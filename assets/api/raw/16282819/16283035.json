You’ll work alongside a team of passionate developers who are flipping hiring on its head. You should have experience building single-page applications using AngularJS, React or similar. You don’t mind JavaScript’s eccentricities. You’ve done terrifying things with media queries and CSS animations. #ff7800 is your favorite color. Our SPAs are built with React and Angular on top of plain old JavaScript. Our engineering philosophy is “practicality first” – that means mobile-first when it makes sense, Edge support where we need it, and Flexbox when we can get it. If you thrive in a fun, fast-paced, energetic, tech-centric environment, now&#x27;s the time to give us a shout. Together, we&#x27;ll change how developers find work – forever.<p>We&#x27;re also looking for an Account Manager, a Salesperson and a Content Marketer&#x2F;Growth Hacker.
