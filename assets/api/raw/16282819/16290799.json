We make it easy for our (often non-technical) users to create, manage and deploy state of the art machine learning algorithms against high volume streams of conversational data. The product is a B2B SaaS machine learning and analytics platform controlled and monitored via a web UI.<p>We’re a VC backed, early stage startup that’s growing very fast. New joiners have an opportunity to make a big impact, from a small team, to tackle a huge commercial problem.  Technically, the work is innovative and challenging. The ML models train in real-time without human supervision, are deployed against very large scale streaming datasets in a platform which is highly robust from an availability and security standpoint.<p>re:infer was founded by machine learning researchers, engineers and entrepreneurs from UCL and Google. We’re a small team of technologists motivated by solving the very hard problem of getting machines to understand human communication.<p>Our stack includes: Python, Rust, Typescript, React, RethinkDB, Theano, Docker, Kubernetes<p>If you&#x27;re interested, please send a CV and anything else you think would be helpful to jobs@reinfer.io","time":1517582703,"type":"comment"}
