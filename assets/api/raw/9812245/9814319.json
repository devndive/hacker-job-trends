We just had our best month and best quarter EVER and are excited to continue growing throughout the second half of the year. We&#x27;ve gone from 6 to 45 employees in the last 12 months and are looking for our third office in less than a year...to say we&#x27;re growing quickly is an understatement!<p>We&#x27;re looking for amazing people in all functions, including but not limited to ENGINEERS (who doesn&#x27;t need a great engineer or two these days?), account executive, sales development reps, customer success managers, designers...and pretty much everything in between!<p>We&#x27;re not your average startup that swings between raising rounds and burning through piles of cash; we bootstrapped to over $1 million in ARR (annual recurring revenue) and 100 customers before raising a seed round from amazing investors like Google Ventures, Mark Cuban, and IDG Ventures.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in hearing more about us and the roles we&#x27;re trying to fill, send me an email directly to jon@datanyze.com!","time":1435777252,"type":"comment"}
