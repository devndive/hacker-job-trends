World-class companies (Airbnb, Mercedes, Nordstrom to mention a few) use Medallia to create awesome customer experiences.<p>The Medallia platform is business-critical to our customers and used by their whole organization from the front-line employees to the executive team. Our platform is already used by hundreds of thousands of people every day, but we need your help to handle the next 10X of growth.<p>We are building the new platform based on the latest technologies and best practices: pure REST APIs, based on Swagger 2.0, on top of a state-of-the-art microservice architecture built by our awesome Systems Foundation team. Code is hosted on Github and we open source the components that are of general interest. We host hundreds of millions of records for our customers and run analytics in fractions of a second with no pre-computation thanks to our own in-memory analytics engine.<p>Please send me a note at kristian@medallia.com if any of the above sounds interesting to you.<p>Kristian Eide\nSoftware Architect","time":1435852765,"type":"comment"}
