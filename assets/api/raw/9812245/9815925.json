Our goal is to enable firms to do so by providing access to the cutting-edge statistical models of co-founder Wharton Professor Peter Fader that forecast customer behavior far into the future. To accomplish this goal and allow companies to implement customer-centric marketing strategies, our world-class team of statisticians, marketers, and data scientists is building an enterprise-grade cloud-based analytics suite to commercialize our own award-winning research on consumer behavior, marketing theory, and statistics.<p>Our founding team has the technical expertise for the back-end (C++ and R), and we are looking to add an expert full stack developer to the team to help us design, code, and ultimately manage the system architecture as we deploy our product. Currently, our stack runs on AWS with Python (Flask) and AngularJS on the front end. Experience with SQL&#x2F;NoSQL technologies a huge plus.<p>The key issues that we will face are: \n-Infrastructure security: We’re touching some of a corporation&#x27;s most sensitive data \n-System robustness: This will be mission-critical software for a company as they will base numerous marketing decisions on the information \n-Scalability: We will be working with massive data sets (millions of customers and hundreds of millions of transactions) and computationally intensive models<p>If you&#x27;re looking for new engineering challenges, please contact justin@clvmetrics.com.","time":1435792980,"type":"comment"}
