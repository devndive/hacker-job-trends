Programmable limits, auto reload, data visualization, etc. We recently closed a $5M series A to make this happen.<p>Many of these features are early in their life, so the UI&#x2F;Visual designer is going to have a very large say in what they become.<p>We believe design should be practical and beautiful, in that order.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a designer that&#x27;s principled - with strong ideas about what makes an execution &quot;good&quot;, and pragmatic - with the ability to foresee and accommodate edge cases and implementation gotchas.<p>We&#x27;re a small team, so the right designer has a mix of narrow expertise and broad knowledge.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in working directly alongside the CEO, CTO, and UX designer on a wide range of really interesting problems, we&#x27;d love to hear from you at jobs+hn@karmiclabs.com.
