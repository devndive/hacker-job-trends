We are building a complete application suite and the tools to manage it.  Our focus now is the Business Intelligence marketplace, which is exploding with opportunity.<p>We hate putting people in boxes, so think of these points as guidelines for the people that will be most successful with us:<p>- Substantial professional software development experience<p>- Knows our tech stack or has long track record of learning fast<p>- Self-teaches new technologies, but not always anxious to use them<p>- Loves design almost as much as implementing modules and fixing broken things<p>- Knows how to hit a deadline but also knows when and how to explain a delay<p>We move fast and require each team member to manage requirements and priorities that are established collectively. What we lack in formality, we make up for in results.<p>Contact: mike@answerrocket.com","time":1435763038,"type":"comment"}
