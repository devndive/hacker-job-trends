We need someone with expert level CSS skills, impeccable WordPress experience, and solid JavaScript, PHP &amp; MySQL skills. Experience building sites with extremely large loads is a plus. We like our stuff to run fast and smooth.<p>We’re currently working on high-profile WordPress implementations that range between conventional to seriously bleeding edge. We will want to see plugin code examples – public plugins are ideal. We want people that are able to develop code that can withstand high profile sites and intense loads. You should be comfortable working as part of a team – your code will have to integrate into an existing architecture.
