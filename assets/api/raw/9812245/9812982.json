We&#x27;ll be pushing the full Grasswire live in a couple weeks, and have an excited user base anxiously waiting. We&#x27;re playing with some stuff on the current <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grasswire.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grasswire.com</a> now, so you can check that out, but the next iteration will be quite different.<p>Our backend is built in Scala, and use the Play framework as our front end templating engine, but this position will be mostly working with our senior web developer in HTML&#x2F;CSS(SASS)&#x2F;Javascript (jQuery and AJAX). This would be a great position for someone who is good with JS and really looking to cut their teeth and get used to shipping quickly and iteratively. We try to ship daily to production. It&#x27;s scrappy and intense and that&#x27;s how we like it.<p>Check out <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grasswire.recruiterbox.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;fk059b\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grasswire.recruiterbox.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;fk059b</a> to apply or email me austen@grasswire.com with questions","time":1435767463,"type":"comment"}
