We&#x27;re looking for a talented software engineer who takes their personal development seriously and seeks to make a huge impact.<p>You&#x27;ll be working alongside a small, driven team right in the heart of the profit center.  Our division of Connexity works in online display advertising through RTB, and we run 50 to 100 million impressions each day. Our total transaction volume is between 5 and 10 billion per day, and I&#x27;d bet you a beer we&#x27;ve served ads on nearly every site you&#x27;ve ever visited.<p>We&#x27;re primarily looking for someone to contribute to our Rails app. It&#x27;s used to administer hundreds of advertising campaigns across hundreds of publisher sites. It&#x27;s not just boring CRUD. It&#x27;s the heart of our display advertising business. The business folks will know you, and you&#x27;ll find that excellence will stir up a tremendous amount of appreciation for your work.<p>This role is a great way to learn advertising tech at scale as well as other tools. In addition to Rails work, you&#x27;d get hands on experience with Redis, Hbase, PostgreSQL, R and Scala. Several on the team started in the Rails app and have moved into other areas of interest (low-latency RTB bidder written in C, sophisticated reporting pipelines or novel optimization algorithms). It&#x27;s really possible to get bored around here unless you&#x27;re a boring person.<p>Our team is sharp and works well together. We enjoy perks such as daily paid lunch, a 9&#x2F;80 schedule (to get every other Friday off) and unlimited vacation; the culture of our team recognizes and respects the importance of your non-work life. Also, Ventura county is a pretty nice place to live&#x2F;work (unless you hate temperate coastal weather). If you&#x27;ve got Rails or other relevant web app experience, that&#x27;s a good start. More importantly, you&#x27;ll be eager to learn display advertising inside and out. Attitude, ambition and sound judgement trump experience with a specific set of tools.<p>We&#x27;re a small team within a medium-sized organization, and we work hard to keep the small-team vibe while availing ourselves of the best bits from the mother ship.<p>Unless you prefer to start with a HR-oriented chat, you can reach me (a lead engineer on the team) at david.larsen@connexity.com.","time":1435763941,"type":"comment"}
