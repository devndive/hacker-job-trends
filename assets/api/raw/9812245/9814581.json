And yet we continue using the same legacy protocol stack (TCP&#x2F;HTTP&#x2F;SSL) to connect mobile devices to the cloud. If you want to help change that, come join us.<p>Packetzoom is rethinking the whole stack from the ground up. You get to hack network and&#x2F;or security protocols, innards of mobile operating systems and build a global distributed system around brand new protocols. It&#x27;s a very small (but well funded) team so everyone contributes in everything. We&#x27;re looking for a senior all-round engineering leaders to round out the core team.<p><i>PACKETZOOM ENGINEERING LEADER</i><p>If you have shipped products or built services where you (at least) actually had to deal with unix at the syscall level (either in the userspace or kernel) in C&#x2F;C++ code, we want to talk to you. If you were responsible for shipping and maintaining the product for a few years, we really want to talk to you.<p>You&#x27;d be joining a small, elite team of other misfits who build and run the PacketZoom protocol (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;packetzoom.com&#x2F;learn.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;packetzoom.com&#x2F;learn.html</a>) on millions of mobile client devices (iOS, Android and any others we decide to pursue) as well as our globally distributed cluster of servers running our own C++ and java code, while harvesting and processing millions of mobile perf data points in realtime while squeezing every last ounce of performance out of the hardware. If that sounds like fun to you, please do connect.<p>We&#x27;re venture funded and have paying customers. Compensation will be market appropriate for your level and startups at our stage.","time":1435779562,"type":"comment"}
