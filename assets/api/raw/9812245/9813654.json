Especially important skills:<p><pre><code>  * Excellent written and verbal communication skills\n  * Customer facing experience as this is a pre-sales role\n  * Familiarity with Git and GitHub\n  * Ability to talk with both technical and non-technical employees \n    both internal to GitHub and at customer sites\n</code></pre>\nYou can see the sales engineering job post here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.github.com&#x2F;positions&#x2F;2f1183c2-482d-11e4-9945-68b929fd64d1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.github.com&#x2F;positions&#x2F;2f1183c2-482d-11e4-9945-68...</a><p>One last thing that I&#x27;d like to point out for all of our roles (it&#x27;s at the bottom of the job post too, but I think it&#x27;s important): GitHub is made up of people with many different backgrounds and lifestyles, and we like it that way. We invite applications from people of all stripes. We don&#x27;t discriminate against employees or applicants based on gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, race, religion, age, national origin, citizenship, pregnancy status, veteran status, or any other differences that people imagine to discriminate against one another.<p>Please apply if you think this might be a good fit for you. You can&#x27;t waste our time!","time":1435772254,"type":"comment"}
