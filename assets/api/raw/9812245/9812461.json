It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after three years, we’re moving data for a quarter of all K-12 students in America (16M kids), and 36,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of 60 (25 engineers) based in downtown SF.  We’re looking for full-stack engineers who like:<p>-Go, Coffeescript and Python (or are willing to learn)<p>-big responsibilities (there are 700,000 students on the platform per engineer here)<p>-hard technical problems (managing a huge, constantly updating data pipeline)<p>-tech talks on everything ranging from the history of hip-hop to neuroscience to exoplanets<p>Check us out at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs#software-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs#software-engineer</a>, or check out what we’re working on at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;clever\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;clever</a>.","time":1435764487,"type":"comment"}
