We all know that video chat is powerful, but has not been done quite right… yet. This will not be your average iOS app—we are building something beautiful with very powerful video chat and online connectivity under the hood.<p>We are looking for another iOS developer to help us build the next big thing and change the way people interact with each other. You would sit next to and work with me personally, and I can promise that you will be proud of what you are building.<p>If this sounds interesting, feel free to email me at: dan@airtime.com","time":1435763133,"type":"comment"}
