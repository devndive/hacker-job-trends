This isn’t some shiny but vacant consumer app. There’s real complexity both in terms of volumes of data that we deal with, and how we visualise the results of hundreds of rules running across thousands of portfolios – in a way that’s simple, understandable and easy to manage.<p>We’re looking for someone to take our industry leading user experience to the next level, working closely with our UX and Visual designer. While we’re leagues ahead of our desktop, grey-screen based competitors, there’s so much more we can do. You’ll take a huge role in shaping the evolution of our product – from tackling those small tweaks that can have an immediate impact for customers through to the broader user experience and the technical approach we want to take.<p>More here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fundapps.workable.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fundapps.workable.com&#x2F;</a> or email me direct - james@fundapps.co if you have questions (I&#x27;m CTO).
