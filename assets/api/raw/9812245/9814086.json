We know that communication is the key to these happy relationships, so we build software that makes customer conversations easy and more productive.<p>Email is how business gets done even in 2015. Zendesk customers heavily utilize email and I&#x27;m part of the team that handles all things email-related at Zendesk. We&#x27;re currently looking for productive, experienced Ruby developers. We send and receive A LOT of mail so you&#x27;ll be working on code that runs on a massive scale. Email experience is a big plus.<p>Personal word about Zendesk:<p>I joined in March 2015 and I&#x27;m loving it so far. Zendesk is an excellent place to work. There are no political games, really smart people everywhere, a book club, great benefits, &quot;take what you need&quot; vacation policy, stock benefits, etc. I highly recommend at least talking with us.<p>Ask me anything at mram@zendesk.com","time":1435775382,"type":"comment"}
