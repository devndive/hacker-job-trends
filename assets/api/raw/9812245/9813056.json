We build our own tools to manage our distribution centers. thredUP is growing and our engineering team is still small, so you’ll have a great chance to make an impact.\nThere are some other nice things about working here - one of the most diverse teams you’ll find anywhere, a focus on professional development, and some neat perks (Work from home Wednesday!). I am one of the engineers - if you are interested or would like to know more, feel free to shoot me an email (ryan at thredup.com).","time":1435767919,"type":"comment"}
