{"by":"butner","id":9814862,"parent":9812245,"text":"Stride Health is a health insurance recommendation engine geared towards the freelancers and independent contractors that make up one third of the U.S. labor force.<p>A user builds a health profile, and we use that information to predict their medical costs for the year and recommend a best-fit plan. After that, we&#x27;re in it for the long haul: our personal support team is on call to help the user manage their health wisely, day-in, day-out. We&#x27;re also well on our way to launching additional products that will evolve us into a broader HR support structure for independent workers.<p>Striders work hard, sweat the details, and enjoy life away from our computers together, too. We&#x27;re looking for true team players that are passionate about our product, loyal to our users, and excited to heal a sick industry.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stridehealth.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stridehealth.com&#x2F;jobs</a>","time":1435782141,"type":"comment"}
