I have only positive things to say  about working here. The people are intelligent and helpful, a lot of interesting problems to solve and the work hours are unbelievably sane. The company is strongly data driven and very dynamic, which was one of its biggest charms for me. Amsterdam is not a bad place to be either :) The work environment is very international and everybody speaks fluent English. The relocation process is also very finely tuned.<p>If you have any other questions about the company or the hiring process or you would like me to refer you, please feel free to send me an email at siddharthsarda01 at gmail.com (Email also in my profile at Hacker news).<p>We are hiring for our headquarters office in Amsterdam:<p>- Frontend developers (JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, A&#x2F;B testing) - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;cxmso8\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;cxmso8</a><p>- Perl developers (Perl, MySQL, Memcached, Hadoop, Apache, NGINX) - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;g5n6oe\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;g5n6oe</a><p>- Data scientists - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;n4o02e\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;n4o02e</a><p>For all available positions take a look here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;3ryvfg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;3ryvfg</a>","time":1435766137,"type":"comment"}
