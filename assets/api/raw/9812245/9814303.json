We’re excited to be making games in a new age of gaming, when so many people are discovering and playing games for the first time. We believe that these players deserve to have a fun, modern gaming experience. Slots games have a long tradition in casinos, and we&#x27;re excited to be making new types of slots games that have never before been possible.<p>Our company operates entirely in the cloud, there is no physical office and no nationality boundaries. Everyone works from the comfort of their home. Smart people like you don’t belong in corporations with bureaucratic hierarchies. We want to work with people who are honest, direct and have a “go-get-it-done-attitude”.<p>We program primarily in C# in the Unity engine so we can collaborate and deploy quickly. We run our own server stack, dynamic tuning system and analytics platform on AWS. We live in Slack, GitHub, and other modern tools that makes life easier. We animate our assets using Spine, and apply particle effects directly inside Unity.<p>Fox Cub does not have an external facing mission. We are not out to change the world.\nOur core mission is internal facing: We are trying to be happy.<p>You can apply by going through our jobs page for the position you&#x27;re interested in.
