Protect insurance policyholder money efficiently instead of sucking as much profit out of the market as possible. Work 40 hour weeks (for real).<p>We are looking for people with a hybrid software engineer&#x2F;financial math skill set. Heavy on one or the other is okay but <i>some</i> exposure to both is necessary: we continuously hack on our in-house C# hedging platform, and we don&#x27;t do it with corporate IT specs and requirements thrown over the wall, so you need to be able to understand how our hedging strategies work.<p>Apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.allianz.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;allianzlife\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.allianz.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;allianzlife</a> using reference code AZL-53324542-2. That job posting focuses on fixed income&#x2F;strategy experience and requires a master&#x27;s degree equivalent, but don&#x27;t be put off: we have other openings. You can also email me at andy.feldman@allianzlife.com or just reply to this comment. I am a manager on the hedging team, not a recruiter.","time":1435771774,"type":"comment"}
