The vision is that biologists won&#x27;t need their own labs anymore - they&#x27;ll go to a website. Instead of doing manual labor, they&#x27;ll write code.<p>We&#x27;re looking for badassery in the following areas:<p>1) software engineers - mostly Python<p>2) mechanical engineers<p>3) roboticists<p>4) wet lab technicians with experience in chemistry or biochemistry labs<p>5) Operations folks to help setup our our automated lab<p>6) Anyone else who kicks ass in significant technically deep ways in an engineering or scientific discipline.<p>In general, we have—and are continuing to—build a team of extreme technical and scientific ass-kickers, in a joyful, bullshit-free, you-own-it kind of environment. We are backed by Founders Fund, and located in Redwood City, CA email us at join@synthego.com for more information.","time":1435801626,"type":"comment"}
