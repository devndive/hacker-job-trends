Organizations struggle just to store it all, let alone make sense of it. Enigma helps organizations and individuals fuse, organize, and explore data to make smarter decisions.​​\nAt Enigma, we started from the realization that there is an enormous quantity of hidden knowledge locked away in data silos and obscure formats, just waiting to be released. We are building data discovery and analytics tools that make it simple for organizations to liberate their own private data, and for the wider community to explore and build upon Enigma’s own integrated public data platform. We believe data can reveal tremendous things about the world and that it will continue to transform it in the years and decades to come.","time":1435767899,"type":"comment"}
