We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.<p>We&#x27;re a startup â€” we&#x27;re 60 people who have been working on this since March 2015. We&#x27;ve built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices.
