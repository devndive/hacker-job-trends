You should have a strong systems background, experience with C++, and ideally familiar with the challenges of scientific data storage and analysis. We are looking to further the development of the TileDB storage manager and build interfaces to TileDB from Python, R, Java&#x2F;Spark, Matlab and Excel, and expand TileDB with computational capabilities. We are also interested in part-time contracts for the development of specific features, e.g., Matlab bindings, ingestion of array data formats (HDF5, NetCDF-4) or genomics formats (FastQ, BAM, VCF) and imaging formats (TIFF, PNG, DICOM, etc).<p>Apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiledb.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;3B5B9E06DA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiledb.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;3B5B9E06DA</a>.<p>Contact us at careers@tileb.io with questions.","time":1512156655,"type":"comment"}
