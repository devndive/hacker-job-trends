Enigma was founded in 2012 in order to centralize and normalize public data globally (think Google for public data).\nOur view is that public data reflects more of our everyday lives than most of us realize. It’s everywhere, from a plane taking off from an airport to a barrel of crude oil flowing through a pipeline to a new drug being approved. These things exist in specific and separate public datasets, but together, they can provide a vast and powerful view of what’s happening in the world.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enigma.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enigma.com&#x2F;</a>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enigma.com&#x2F;labs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enigma.com&#x2F;labs</a><p>Today, we’ve grown into an operational data management and intelligence company that uses public data to inform and train each of our products. Our mission is to empower people to interpret and improve, the world around them. We believe in \ncuriosity and the power of discovery.\nWe’re actively hiring and would love to hear from you.
