As well as exploring interesting avenues of tech such as machine learning, service architecture, mobile, desktop and web user experiences and in many other areas.<p>We would love more engineers, up and down the stack, and anywhere on the generalist &lt;-&gt; specialist spectrum. We use pretty cutting-edge tech (React, React-Native for mobile, TypeScript + Node for backend), but we&#x27;re a lot more interested in engineering chops than any particular tech skills.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in hearing more, reach out and grab coffee with me or one of our other developers. Help us grow an amazing tech team from a very early point in our company&#x27;s history!<p>Some, but not necessarily all, of our open jobs: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.convoy.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.convoy.com</a>","time":1512146456,"type":"comment"}
