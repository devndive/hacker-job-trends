View all our jobs here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;ex5dth1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;ex5dth1</a><p>However, I&#x27;m a developer in the Berlin office, where we create the real device platform. We have thousands of physical Android and iOS devices that we make available for automated and manual testing for our customers, as reliably as possible.<p>Here are some of the challenges we&#x27;re taking on:<p>* Writing software does low level interactions with phones (e.g. getting video and simulating gestures) and ensuring this software works across nearly all devices<p>* Cleaning&#x2F;resetting devices after tests<p>* Moving to zero-downtime deploys when we can&#x27;t avoid state (we do have physical phones connected to servers at some point after all)<p>* Making a library of hundreds of different models of phone with different requirements and compatibilities and reliability all appear consistently and reliably to our customers<p>* Lots more, depending on the day!<p>Our tech stack is Java, Docker, Angular and React. There&#x27;s only ~8 of us on the real device team and we need help, preferably from folks with Java experience but low level Android or iOS would also be great! We need another frontend developer too!<p>Apply with the link I gave above or if you have any questions please reach out to me (mcrum at saucelabs dot com). I&#x27;ve been here for a couple years now and we have a great team!","time":1512231432,"type":"comment"}
