Some people have called us strange, they work for us now! We’re committed to doing things differently, so check out our YouTube Channel or read the blog posts and see that we’re more that just a bunch of people in suits.<p>Generally, Corso is a Systems Integration Firm, specializing in Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), SCADA, and other Business System Integrations (ERP and anything else you can think).<p>We’re expanding into brewing and so we’re looking for a Software Engineer to join the team to help us build it out. Check out BrewTel: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;corsosystems.com&#x2F;brewtel&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;corsosystems.com&#x2F;brewtel&#x2F;</a> that’s what would be first on your plate, we’ve got the plan and are looking for help to execute. If you’re a craft beer fan or home brewer and are able to use that experience to help build this out, that would be amazing!<p>Ideally you’d have some experience in: C#&#x2F;ASP.NET MVC, or Rails, and SQL, Web Services, and API’s. Plus you’d be able to take a project and run with it yourself with minimal help. We’re not micromanagers and we trust everyone to get their work done.<p>If you’re interested in learning more about the industrial side of the business to make you a more well rounded individual and help with some of the other jobs (because most of the dev work will be easier than what you’re doing right now). Looking to join a small team already making a difference with big dreams, we should talk.<p>On the chance that there are Controls Engineers on here who are experiences in Ignition and&#x2F;or Siemens WinCC OA, AB and Siemens PLC’s drop me a line, we should also have a conversation, we’re growing fast.<p>Email me: Dave@CorsoSystems.com We’d love to have a conversation.","time":1512145779,"type":"comment"}
