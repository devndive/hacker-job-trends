We’re looking for more backend developers to work both on APIs, but also on user-facing features. Teams are small, a lot of the code is open-source, backend deploys take few seconds and we do 100+ of them a day, the CI says tests are passing, scaling and performance are daily concerns.<p>And some not-so-technical. Users are millions and kinda like us, 100% distributed – we meet in person few times per year anywhere in the world, growing stable business, all internal communication is open to anybody, people rarely leave the company.<p>More here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;automattic.com&#x2F;work-with-us&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;automattic.com&#x2F;work-with-us&#x2F;</a><p>Stack:\n- PHP REST API &amp; open-source PHP WordPress plugins (Jetpack, WooCommerce)\n- modern JavaScript single-page app frontend, 100% open-source: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Automattic&#x2F;wp-calypso\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Automattic&#x2F;wp-calypso</a>\n- various other systems in Python, Go, Erlang, Java…","time":1512214481,"type":"comment"}
