This still isn&#x27;t possible today because we don&#x27;t have access to the right guidance when we need it the mostâ€”before we make a health decision. In our world of increasingly ubiquitous technology, what&#x27;s missing is a way for us to receive scientifically accurate and personalized suggestions to help us improve our health each day.
