It can connect to 81 grocery chains like Walmart, Safeway, Kroger etc. and automatically download every purchase a user makes into the app. It uses NLP to match each product purchased to recipe ingredients. Over 1,000,000 products are matched to 1,400,000 recipes. I’ve built Cooklist over the last 9 months and it’s now live in private beta. Hundreds of users are participating in the development process. 10,000+ purchases have been downloaded in the last week.
