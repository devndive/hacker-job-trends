All code we make is free, we sell our time to build custom implementations from collecting and analyzing sensor data from offshore windparks to managing product flow in car assembly lines. We all use Chromebooks, have a flat hierarchy, paperless offices and no meetings. We mostly hack in Python and (vanilla) JavaScript. Come join us!","time":1512168433,"type":"comment"}
