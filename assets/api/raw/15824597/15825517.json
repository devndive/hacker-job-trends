Also, at least willingness to learn German is crucial.<p>Our hiring process:<p>1) Resume &#x2F; code-check<p>2) Phone call (getting to know each other + quick technical interview, no Google-questions)<p>3) Onsite (half a day) more technical assessment.<p>As you can see on our career-website (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ti8m.ch&#x2F;en&#x2F;career.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ti8m.ch&#x2F;en&#x2F;career.html</a>), we have a lot of jobs opened.
