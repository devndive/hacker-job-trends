We build hardware and software that allow research organizations to connect their existing lab instruments to a cloud infrastructure, in a sense, an online dashboard to coordinate experiments, monitor equipment parameters, and manage experimental data, as well as an integration layer between instruments and a customer&#x27;s ELN or LIMS system-of-choice. In short, our goal at TetraScience is to use IoT to increase the efficiency of scientific research.<p>Our goal at TetraScience is to effect industry-wide change, and we have intentionally built a team of passionately curious engineers of diverse backgrounds who support science and value scientific advancement. You know the quote “The best minds of [our] generation are thinking about how to make people click ads”? We&#x27;re a decent counterexample.<p>Overall, it&#x27;s a fun, sharp team with a lot of potential upside working in a fairly interesting space (well, <i>I</i> like science anyway...). Plus, we&#x27;re probably in the best location in the world to be doing what we&#x27;re doing, and we&#x27;re hiring experienced folks across the board. Join us!<p>Stack: Node, React, Python, Postgres, Elasticsearch, Mongo, Docker, AWS...<p>I&#x27;m one of the senior engineers, and am incredibly bullish on our prospects conditioned on continuing to get the right talent as we grow, hit me up at jg.public@tetrascience.com if you&#x27;re interested.","time":1512154408,"type":"comment"}
