We&#x27;ve raised over $8m and are well established with a staff of 40 people. The development team is roughly 10 engineers plus a few data scientists.<p>For each of these roles the more experience you have in call centres the better; for the product designer and UX roles there&#x27;s a chance that you might end up supporting other applications we are developing, so call centre experience isn&#x27;t super-important. Product experience with AI applications (natural language processing and machine learning) would be helpful as well.<p>For the right candidate we would consider someone working out of our Sydney (St Leonard&#x27;s) office, but ideally you would be working from Melbourne (Cremorne).<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daisee.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;0563B9025B\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daisee.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;0563B9025B</a>","time":1546482866,"type":"comment"}
