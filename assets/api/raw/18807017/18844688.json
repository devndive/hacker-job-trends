At the same time, one can visualize the molecule using highly-sensitive fluorescence microscopy. Our customers use it to watch DNA being copied by the molecular machinery of the cell, or observe molecular &quot;engines&quot; walking across the scaffolding structures of a human cell. Lumicks systems are currently in use in opinion-leading labs across the globe, including Rockefeller University, Johns Hopkins, ShanghaiTech, Max-Planck, Imperial College, and Pasteur Institute.<p>We&#x27;re an academic spin-off from a research group at VU University Amsterdam. We care deeply about providing our users with easy-to-use, reliable software that actively supports Open Data and Reproducible Science.
