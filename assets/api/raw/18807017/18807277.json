At Dremio we are solving this by offering a Data as a Service platform - allowing analysts and data scientists to work with large sets of data no matter where and how they are stored.<p>We heavily contribute to and use several open source projects like Apache Arrow to achieve this and are hiring engineers. We are looking for both front-end engineers and full-stack engineers (we use Java on the backend) to help grow our product.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dremio.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dremio.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a>","time":1546446203,"type":"comment"}
