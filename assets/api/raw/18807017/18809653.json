We make and sell CNC carving machines for entrepreneurs, home users, libraries, maker spaces, and schools. We write software for every step of the process, from creating a design to driving the machine. That means there&#x27;s a huge variety of technical challenges and design challenges.<p>If you&#x27;re a programmer or designer who spends their evenings working with powertools or Aduinos, we definitely want to talk with you. If you don&#x27;t even know what CNC is, but the idea of working on software that can turn computer-based designs into physical objects is exciting to you, we want to talk to you as well.<p>I&#x27;ve been working here as a software engineer for two years, and I&#x27;m really excited about our next phase of growth and some of the work we have planned for the next year. If you&#x27;re in Chicago (or thinking of moving here), and you want to know the details of why, hit me up at david@inventables.com.","time":1546459653,"type":"comment"}
