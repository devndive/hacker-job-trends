Our products run on our technology platform, using public blockchain to settle and clear public securities on a daily basis.<p>We believe in a future where everything is tokenized, and we are starting with tokenizing our own ETF in 2019 in addition to building the backend infrastructure for compliance, fund administration, and accounting necessary to operate not just our own products but other issuers as well. This is a rare opportunity to work on a crypto&#x2F;blockchain product with a direct connection to a top ten global stock exchange.<p>Looking for software engineers excited about building this vision, in our office in New York for those authorized to work in the United States or Zurich for those with EU residency or work authorization.<p>Please contact us at careers@amun.com","time":1546527122,"type":"comment"}
