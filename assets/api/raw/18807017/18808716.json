If you&#x27;ve ever been backed up on pull requests or needed to nag people about code reviews, you&#x27;re familiar with the problem Pull Reminders solves. Pull Reminders launched in early 2017 and is currently used by over 800 companies. Right now the company is just me (Abi) but I&#x27;m looking to hire someone early this year to help.<p>The tech stack is primarily Ruby on Rails, Postgres, and Heroku. Some Docker experience would be a plus. If you&#x27;re interested please email abi+hiring@pullreminders.com. Please be forewarned that I may be slow to respond since there&#x27;s just one of me.","time":1546454304,"type":"comment"}
