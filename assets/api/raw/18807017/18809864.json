I am a hiring manager for a couple roles in Wilmington DE in our bank side of the business. In particular I am looking for a lead or senior engineer with preferably some experience in search technologies and more backend engineering. Our current stack for this system is node.js, react, graphQL, elasticsearch, Postgres, all in AWS with push button deployment. This is a full stack role since in Capital One if you build it you own it.<p>We have a lot of open positions at Capital One and we are not your typical bank, our AWS footprint is impressive and how we have worked to operate as a technology first company in a regulated environment has been progressive. I am happy to talk about Capital One in general as well.<p>email me jeffrey.barrett@capitalone.com","time":1546460930,"type":"comment"}
