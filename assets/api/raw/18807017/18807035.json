We build the API for iPlayer, which is used by the Mobile Apps, TV Apps and the Website.<p>We&#x27;re heavily investing into personalisation and experimentation at the moment, working closely across all three platforms and finding the best ways to promote the right content to each user individually at the right time and in the right way. Another focus this year is on Live events, and Music, Sports and News content. There is scope to have a real impact on the product and consulting with architects and product managers.<p>Our tech stack is mostly Node.js, with several dozen microservices. We manage a couple hundred EC2 instances, dozens of Redis caches and databases, and half a dozen Postgres databases, with code deployed directly to production every day. We have 10% time, as well as days dedicated to personal objectives, and some working from home days.<p>Full job description: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careershub.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;members&#x2F;modules&#x2F;job&#x2F;detail.php?record=34164\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careershub.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;members&#x2F;modules&#x2F;job&#x2F;detail.php?...</a><p>And some more background about how we work in two blog posts:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iplayer.engineering&#x2F;how-an-iplayer-api-engineer-delivers-platform-features-across-platforms-f0b508dcf7b3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iplayer.engineering&#x2F;how-an-iplayer-api-engineer-deli...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iplayer.engineering&#x2F;the-tech-stack-that-powers-bbc-iplayer-471575318e2a\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iplayer.engineering&#x2F;the-tech-stack-that-powers-bbc-i...</a>","time":1546445006,"type":"comment"}
