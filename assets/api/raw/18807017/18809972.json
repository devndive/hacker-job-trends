The entire team spends a lot of time outdoors, which imbues the work with an unusual level of personal attachment. Everyone (including support and marketing) contributes to the code. People at Gaia GPS have done all the major thru-hikes, along with other outdoor feats, and the engineering team universally hails from strong software backgrounds.<p>Gaia GPS is profitable, boot-strapped, and growing rapidly - we expect to double revenues again in 2019 and grow the team to over 20 people.<p>►► Roles<p>We&#x27;re mostly focused on hiring people who want to focus on frontend&#x2F;middleware at the moment, but we tend to prefer candidates who can deal with back-end things like data structures, API, and SQL with ease. We&#x27;re hurting for an applicant with a strong iOS background in particular.<p>Apply here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gaiagps.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;software_developer&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gaiagps.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;software_developer&#x2F;</a>","time":1546461631,"type":"comment"}
