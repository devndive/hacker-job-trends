We closed funding from Aviva, one the UK&#x27;s largest insurers, late last year and we&#x27;re now looking to grow the team. We sell our own insurance policies, and also provide a white labelled version of our IoT platform to insurers around the world.<p>Specifically we&#x27;re looking for mid-level&#x2F;senior developers on both frontend and backend, project managers, product managers, designers, and QA engineers. For most of those roles we can hire people working in London, Brighton, or remote if you can demonstrate previous experience of doing so effectively.<p>Our tech stack consists of lots of Ruby (and a little bit of Elixir) on the backend, Angular SPAs on the frontend, mobile apps for iOS and Android, alongside hardware from a variety of suppliers which we integrate with our platform.<p>You can see the full job specs at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neos.workable.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neos.workable.com</a>, but if you have any questions feel free to drop me an email on jon.wood@neos.co.uk and I&#x27;ll either answer or find the right person to do so.","time":1546449661,"type":"comment"}
