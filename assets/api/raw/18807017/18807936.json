They rely on Pachyderm to do the heavy lifting so they can focus on the business logic in their data pipelines.<p>Check us out at:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pachyderm.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pachyderm.com&#x2F;</a><p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pachyderm&#x2F;pachyderm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pachyderm&#x2F;pachyderm</a><p>What would data analytics infrastructure (namely Hadoop) look like if we rebuilt it from scratch today? We think it would be containerized, modular, and easy enough for a single person to use while still being scalable enough for a whole company. Tools like Docker and Kubernetes provide the perfect building blocks for us revolutionize data infrastructure!<p>Pachyderm just raised our Series A led by Benchmark (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pachyderm.io&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;15&#x2F;Series-A.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pachyderm.io&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;15&#x2F;Series-A.html</a>), so you&#x27;d be getting in right at the ground floor and have an enormous impact on the success and direction of the company as well as building the rest of the engineering team.<p>Positions:<p>* Core distributed systems&#x2F;infrastructure engineer (Golang)- Youâ€™ll be solving hard algorithmic and distributed systems problems every day and building a first-of-its-kind, containerized, data infrastructure platform.<p>* Front-end Engineer (Javascript) - Your work will be focused on developing the UI, perfecting the user experience, and pioneering new products such as a hosted version of Pachyderm&#x27;s data solution.<p>* Lead Data Science Evangelist -- be the face of Pachyderm and get OSS users excited! Build machine learning and data science examples, write blog posts, give conference talks, and generally just evangelize Go, Docker, and Kubernetes!","time":1546449853,"type":"comment"}
