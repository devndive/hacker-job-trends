This job is for you if:<p>- you think TypeScript is a leap forward and can&#x27;t wait to use it in a professional context (no prior experience necessary!).<p>- React makes you look back on imperative UI programming as the &quot;dark ages&quot;.<p>- despite all the above, you&#x27;d feel 100% comfortable writing a light web app in Vanilla JS.<p>- you love the idea of directly helping people, rather than mining them for data.<p>- compromising on user experience, letting users do the QA work, or other similar abuses of users&#x27; trust does not fly in your book.<p>This is not at all an entry level position, and our standard for a Senior Engineer title may be higher than what many people are used to. We&#x27;ll be particularly looking for a track record of building user interfaces in a professional context â€“ code samples and live demos are a big plus.<p>Email me directly with &quot;Hello from HN&quot; in the subject line to hear more about the position and to apply formally.<p>My email address (base64 encoded): anVsaWFuK2huQGhpbmdlaGVhbHRoLmNvbQ==","time":1546639336,"type":"comment"}
