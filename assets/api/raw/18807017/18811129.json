Since our founding in 2016, we&#x27;ve worked with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (a primary funder), the Omidyar Network (another primary funder), as well as the United Nations Institute for Training and Research, Schmidt Futures, the World Bank and more.<p>We work with a range of fellows and contractors to support our efforts, but our in-house engineering&#x2F;ML team is just 2 people :) In addition to being somebody who is excited to be part of a small team working on large-scale problems (right now we&#x27;re all generalists, to an extent), we&#x27;re especially interested in applicants who want to help us foster a team culture of respect, inclusion, and diversity.<p>Apply here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2CLLzdK\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2CLLzdK</a><p>If you have any questions, please don&#x27;t hesitate to shoot me an email: alando (at) radiant.earth","time":1546469569,"type":"comment"}
