We&#x27;re the biggest rehearsal studio provider in the UK and rapidly expanding abroad. We build our own studios that are open 24&#x2F;7, and all booking is handled online.<p>We&#x27;re looking to add a developer to our dev team right now. Being excited about music is definitely a bonus, but we have loads of fun and exciting programming projects in the pipeline. Ideas are welcome and many of our improvements come from people in the business suggesting them.<p>Our current primary projects are in Ruby, JavaScript (React), Haskell, and Elixir; with a smattering of Rust and Python in IoT and ML projects. We work in small project-based teams on our various components, and we have dedicated (and good!) project managers who help give us plenty of time and space to focus on programming. Our current focus is around live streaming from inside our studios and this would be the project you&#x27;d be starting on when joining.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone in Bristol to join the team working in our Old Market office. Some of the dev team work remotely, but all of us are within easy distance of Bristol (or London) and we meet up regularly to discuss&#x2F;work&#x2F;beer together. Unfortunately we&#x27;re not currently able to assist in relocation to this area.<p>I&#x27;m Head of Development, and working for Pirate Studios is the best job I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ll go out of my way to make sure you get to build great things :)<p>Email us at tech-jobs@piratestudios.co.uk.","time":1546616223,"type":"comment"}
