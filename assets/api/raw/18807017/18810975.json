We are building new distributed compute and storage products with the goal of changing how people build everything which touches the Internet, and need empathetic, technical, and determined people who want to chart that course.<p>Cloudflare is a unique place to work where the Internet isn&#x27;t just a playing field, it&#x27;s something we can improve and change. Our ultimate mission is to help build the Internet we believe should exist in 2019 while maintaining the compatibility the world needs with the systems and protocols designed in the 70s and 80s.<p>You don&#x27;t have to already be a Product Manager. I&#x27;m also interested in speaking with engineers who believe a role closer to product might be right for them.<p>Reach out -&gt; zack@cloudflare.com","time":1546468354,"type":"comment"}
