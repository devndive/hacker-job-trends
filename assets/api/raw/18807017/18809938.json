After you click the play button in our app, a huge number of services are used to provide the client with streaming video. Our team orchestrates, aggregates, and processes that data to provide the best experience for the customer&#x27;s particular device.<p>We are looking for multiple engineers, from recent grad (or equivalent) to senior. Here&#x27;s why you should consider joining our team!<p>* Flexibility of a Startup with Benefits of a Large Company<p>I come from a startup background and value personal responsibility.  If you have errands or need to work from home, as long as the work is getting done it won&#x27;t hurt the team. As a large company, Amazon also has excellent salaries&#x2F;health insurance, and will provide visa&#x2F;relocation assistance.<p>* Learning<p>I am very focused on my team&#x27;s personal growth. We have started a library, we have brown bag&#x2F;lunch &amp; learn sessions, we have incredibly talented engineers who have weekly office hours, but we can always do more. Feel free to make suggestions!<p>* Scale<p>Prime Video operates on a tremendous scale - without giving exact numbers, we are responsible for close to 10% of the world&#x27;s internet traffic! The challenges are vast and require strong design and architectures to scale cost-effectively.<p>Reach out to me directly with any questions, comments, or if you just want to say hi at `vmangla@amazon.com`!","time":1546461454,"type":"comment"}
