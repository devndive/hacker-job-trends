We form long-term relationships with important clients, acting as a partner in their business success rather than just a vendor. If you&#x27;re excited about tackling some of the most interesting business and technical challenges in this space, you&#x27;ll have fun on our team.<p>Our tech stack is WordPress (PHP 7+) and React&#x2F;Node (ES6). We use a variety of associated tools like webpack, sass, postcss, etc. Our projects often involve React client applications hydrated by a REST API powered by WordPress.<p>We&#x27;re currently looking for any seniority level. Prior media tech experience is a major plus. WP and React experience not strictly required, but you should be prepared to get up to full speed within a few weeks on them (so PHP and JS experience is a must).<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alley.co&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alley.co&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a>","time":1546450413,"type":"comment"}
