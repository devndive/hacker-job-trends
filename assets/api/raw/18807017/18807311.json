Our team develops an internal PaaS based on Kubernetes, and operates the underlying infrastructure. Lots of fun and interesting stuff to do: we run over a thousand different services on our platform, and are constantly evolving it to expose new features and make operations simpler and better for the whole engineering org. The work is a healthy mix of operations (chef, docker, linux, kubernetes) and development (golang). Ops experience is a big plus for background and context, but the work is heavier on development.<p>Actual job post: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;ae902dc11\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;ae902dc11</a>","time":1546446394,"type":"comment"}
