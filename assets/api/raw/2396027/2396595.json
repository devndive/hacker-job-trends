If you think dealing with tricky issues with live streaming video is fun, this might be the job for you. We've got massive growth and we deal with that on a large scale. Ideally you're the sort of developer who does more than just flash/flex, and would welcome stepping into other roles (rails dev, ops.) as well.<p>Paid Intern: We're looking to hire a paid intern to hack on our Ruby/Rails site. We're committed to code quality, and believe strongly in testing.<p>About VOKLE:<p>We were started a year and a half ago and have seen fantastic growth.

We're active members of the community (I'm the organizer of LA Hacker News actually) and this is a great place to be if you want to be a part of it.<p>Contact: andrew@vokle.com","time":1301671672,"type":"comment"}
