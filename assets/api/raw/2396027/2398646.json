The goal will be to develop workflow for extracting wiring diagrams of neuronal circuits from large-scale serial electron microscopy of brain tissue. You can read about what I'm doing at <a href=\"http://www.hhmi.org/research/fellows/bock.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.hhmi.org/research/fellows/bock.html</a>, and browse data at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/ga3Cfk\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bit.ly/ga3Cfk</a>. A detailed writeup of the approach was published a few weeks ago in an article at Nature.<p>I think the ideal candidate could come from a variety of backgrounds -- someone who had previously written or contributed significantly to the development of a game engine could be good, for example. Looking for strong quantitative chops, creativity, and a willingness to do some plumbing in order to make an elegant solution.","time":1301702704,"type":"comment"}
