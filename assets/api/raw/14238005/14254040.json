It has successfully developed its own ‘best-in-class’ platform for delivering online research and now seeks to take this to another level by expanding its team of developers.&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flexmr.net&#x2F;ruby-on-rails-developer-vacancy.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flexmr.net&#x2F;ruby-on-rails-developer-vacancy.aspx</a><p>The current development team is four strong and exists as part of a much larger overall team within the company. All the developers work remotely but meet for two days once a month on site. Day to day we make use of all the tools you&#x27;d expect an efficient, remote team would. We all have input into the technologies and methods used to extend the platform as well as how we work as developers. Importantly (as a developer), work is planned and spec&#x27;d out.<p>At the core, we&#x27;re looking for experienced Ruby on Rails developers. We know that some people may be also more proficient&#x2F;comfortable in the frontend, backend or devops spaces - that&#x27;s all good.<p>We&#x27;d certainly be interested to hear of people who also have industry experience with (any of): Docker, React, Bootstrap, iOS&#x2F;Android app development.<p>Interview process: Initial phone call (screen), take home assignment (technical) followed by an in person interview (on site).<p>Please send any applications (CV and introductory email) to pam.taylor@flexmr.net.
