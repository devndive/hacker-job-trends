Questions?\n  Email Buro (mookerji@swiftnav.com). Apply at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;swift-nav.\n\n  + Firmware (Production embedded programming on the Zynq platform, FPGA-based\n    DSP, C, C++, Python, VHDL, embedded Linux).\n\n  + Web and internal platform infrastructure (front ends, rear ends, services,\n    production programming, Haskell, Python, JS, C++, containerized distributed\n    workflows, etc. etc. etc.).\n\n  + Software infrastructure team lead, preferably with experience in building\n    highly-available, real time sensor products and analytics platforms.\n\n  Our interviews have a few steps: an intro phone call, technical phone screen or\n  take home problem, and an onsite. Our technical interviews aim to fairly assess\n  your skills and also preview our own day-to-day work.\n\n  Satellite navigation is a rich problem space! Our 45 (??!) person group in the\n  Civic Center neighborhood of San Francisco is spread across analog&#x2F;RF&#x2F;digital\n  hardware design and embedded systems, statistics, satellite navigation,\n  functional programming, and web infrastructure. Our work is highly\n  interdisciplinary with an environment emphasizing effective communication,\n  collaboration, and inclusion with a flexible working policy.</code></pre>","time":1493666919,"type":"comment"}
