We&#x27;re happily using React &#x2F; Redux&#x2F; React Native, and GraphQL for our mobile and web applications, and Scala (Cats, Http4s, Shapeless, Freestyle, etc.) on the backend.<p>We like the impact functional programming is having on JavaScript, and very happy to have Facebook&#x27;s Flow for static type annotations. We&#x27;re over-the-moon with ES6 (or whatever you want to call it) and looking forward to the new stuff in ES2017. We&#x27;re even toying around with PureScript for admin tools on both the backend and frontend.<p>Our GraphQL API is backed by Scala, and we&#x27;ve bought into the ethos that GraphQL subtly preaches: CQRS&#x2F;EventSourcing. We&#x27;ve built this largely with the Typelevel stack, and it&#x27;s running on top of AWS Lambda and Kinesis.<p>YOU<p>You&#x27;re a talented and passionate engineer interested in functional programming, unit testing, and strong type systems, but when necessary you&#x27;re willing to relax some constraints to get-things-done.<p>You work well with your colleagues and have the humility to learn from them and the talent to teach them.<p>You are excited about working for an early stage company with promising and tangible prospects!<p>If you are interested, please send your resume to dustin@gopinata.com. Our interview process starts with a phone call to give more information to each other, followed by a tech interview, which will lead to an offer.","time":1493651749,"type":"comment"}
