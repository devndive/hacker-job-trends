Easily transferable skills include those\nrelated to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing,\nfirmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders,\nsoftware verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation,\nsatisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers. We work with\nmore than a dozen architectures including PowerPC&#x2F;ppc&#x2F;POWER, MIPS,\nARMv8&#x2F;Thumb2&#x2F;AArch64, x86-64&#x2F;x64&#x2F;Intel, DSPs, and microcontrollers.\nWe hire from no-degree to PhD. Common degrees include Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics.<p>We don&#x27;t normally work overtime, and we get paid more if we do. We&#x27;re never expected to take work home or be on call. Because of the citizenship requirement, there is no chance that the work will be outsourced. Flex-time is fairly extreme; some do randomish hours.<p>Hint: pick Arlington for a car-free life. Pick Florida to live in a place with no state income tax, a stand-your-ground law, almost no crime, almost no traffic or commute, and houses that commonly go for $100,000 to $400,000.<p>You can contact me at users.sf.net, with account name albert.","time":1493689675,"type":"comment"}
