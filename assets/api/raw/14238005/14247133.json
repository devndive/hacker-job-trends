Our products have millions of users, we move fast, and we take pride in our product and code. We have an incredibly exciting and demanding roadmap ahead, but we need new, core teammates to get it done.<p>Autolist is a fast-growing startup that is building the first mobile optimized, end-to-end automotive marketplace. With the top rated automotive search apps in the Google Play and iOS App Stores, weâ€™re becoming the most popular way for consumers to research, find, and buy their next vehicle.<p>Our engineering team is still small and growing fast. We&#x27;re polyglot, full-stack, and move quickly as our platform scales and our product suite expands. Our tech stacks are modern, cloud-native, and already operating at scale, including micro-services, machine learning, isomorphic front-end apps, native ios&#x2F;android apps, and data science products.<p>I&#x27;m the CTO and one of the engineers.
