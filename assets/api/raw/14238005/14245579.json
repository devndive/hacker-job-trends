Our product, Virtual NanoLab, is used for atomic-scale modelling in the fields of electronics, materials science, and chemistry. Don&#x27;t let the heavy focus on science discourage you, though! We&#x27;re looking for an additional member for our GUI team (currently three people). Some familiarity with developing Qt or PyQt applications is required, and experience with OpenGL is also welcomed.<p>The application process consists of solving an exercise. After the exercise there is a skype interview, and if all goes well we&#x27;ll fly you over to Copenhagen to have a final chat. You can find the application and exercise here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;quantumwise.com&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;jobs#1046\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;quantumwise.com&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;jobs#1046</a><p>edit: Don&#x27;t forget to mention you&#x27;re coming from HN ;)","time":1493725833,"type":"comment"}
