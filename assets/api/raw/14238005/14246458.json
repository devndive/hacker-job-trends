Everything from the database to CSS, software architecture to operations. You must be diverse, be able to quickly pick up new technologies and languages and know when to use what. The job involves working on several interesting projects at a time, and the kind of project will vary greatly. Our company highly values automation, clean code, and testability.<p>Perks &amp; Benefits:\n• Independence and Freedom in a fast career track. Working in a start-up like context means that you can grow and develop faster than in other environments; achieve your career goals in months instead of years. \n• Contrary to start-up like contexts, we offer the financial security of being part of a large international organisation.\n• Every now and then we gather for a Code Retreat where we go on a trip to sharpen our skills and start new &#x27;passion projects&#x27;. These trips can take us to the wilderness of Sweden or why not the beaches of Mallorca.\n• You will join us for our annual ski trip where we meet and socialise with other Trifork teams from around Europe.\n• Knowledge is the heart of Trifork and therefor we offer you education when you want to expand your expertise in certain areas and frequently engage in Tech-talks.<p>Apply here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.trifork.se&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;11461-full-stack-developer?promotion=5310-trackable-share-link-hackernews\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.trifork.se&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;11461-full-stack-developer?promo...</a>","time":1493734457,"type":"comment"}
