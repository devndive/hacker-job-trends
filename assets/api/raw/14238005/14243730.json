We&#x27;re based in London, but we primarily work remotely. We&#x27;re a small team right now, looking to expand as we win more projects with our client - the UK&#x27;s largest purchaser of independent energy generation and leading supplier of renewable energy.<p>In addition to our bespoke solutions work, we&#x27;re also working on a regulatory compliance product - aimed at helping organisations in these sectors react to regulation changes more rapidly. If you&#x27;re from a consultancy background looking for the opportunity to sink your teeth into a product, or vice versa, you could be the person for us!<p>We typically work with C# or Java on the back end, and we find ourselves increasingly building React and Redux based front ends, but we recognise the futility of forcing a hard language requirement. If you&#x27;re a passionate technologist who can demonstrate skill, ambition and (perhaps most importantly) an insatiable hunger to learn, we want to hear from you.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, shoot us an email at talent@ringleadersolutions.com.
