Now, unlike many posters, we&#x27;d like to bring on a few part-time dev&#x27;s who are willing to commit 15-30 hours weekly for at least 6-12 months, probably leading to full time.<p>While Boston is preferred, we are open to anyone from anywhere who has both relevant skills and genuine interested in the problem.  Compensation will be a mix of cash and equity and full-time employment eventually would be not only possible but ideal.<p>Technically we are Javascript-heavy regex-parsing heavy extension-based + ios and Android Apps, Ruby server-side with increasing attention to machine-learning and recursive feedback loops.<p>Please no recruiters - jobs [at] getabine dotcom.","time":1493656955,"type":"comment"}
