We mean it.<p>We value aptitude over alma mater, empathy over a list of APIs. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether your resum√© says PHP or PhD: if you&#x27;re smart, empathetic and know some stuff, we want to work with you.<p>We have many offices worldwide including SF, NYC, Toronto, London, Palo Alto (pivotal.io&#x2F;locations) and more coming. We&#x27;re broken into three main divisions: Pivotal Labs (<i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Cloud R&amp;D and Big Data.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i> helps clients to become better at product development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. We pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud R&amp;D</i> is where we build the best cloud platform available: We&#x27;re the majority contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. Our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i> and it&#x27;s <i>still</i> zooming up and to the right.<p>Except for upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial cloud (Pivotal Web Services).<p>Cloud R&amp;D is also responsible for Pivotal Tracker and Spring.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is our suite of battled-hardened products, now open sourced. Greenplum tackles massive datasets with the comfort of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, donated as Apache Geode, is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, excellent benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong isn&#x27;t mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The NYC beer fridge has more IPAs than I prefer but I guess that&#x27;s life in paradise.<p>-- <i>Applying</i><p>To see open jobs and apply, see: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;xiy346\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;xiy346</a><p>You can also email me at jchester+hn-may17@pivotal.io if you have questions. I won&#x27;t reply to copypasta. I may not be able to reply immediately, as I am just an engineer here. These help me earn a referral bonuses, which I appreciate. I can give the non-referral link upon request.","time":1493651092,"type":"comment"}
