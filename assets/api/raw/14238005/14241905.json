We help people access the courts and the legal system through crowdfunding. Since launch in 2015 we have helped important cases raise £millions in funding, seen claimants get their cases to the Supreme Court, given communities a voice – and we’ve been featured in the Guardian, FT, BBC, TechCrunch, NYT and more.<p>We are looking for developers to join our lean team in central London: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crowdjustice.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;5F3B8C6497\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crowdjustice.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;5F3B8C6497</a><p>The CrowdJustice platform backend is written in Python, Django and Postgres, with the front-end in plain Javascript, HTML and SASS – though you don&#x27;t need experience in all of these. You&#x27;ll be working on new features across the stack, e.g. important (think AML, KYC) internal tools for our awesome case support team, optimising our mobile experience or improving integration with our payment provider (Stripe). As we&#x27;re a small startup, expanding quickly (especially into the US), this is likely to change often and we welcome any help directing the product and technology.<p>Interview Process: 20-30 minute phone&#x2F;hangouts chat about the role (no surprise technical questions!); a 1-2 hour technical task that we pay you to complete; a 1.5 hour on-site interview where we&#x27;ll discuss the technical task, pair program some work and talk about your future at CrowdJustice; if successful, a fair offer and the chance to join a well funded startup early on its mission to increase access to justice!<p>If you have any questions send them across to: gavin ~a-t~ crowdjustice.com","time":1493674559,"type":"comment"}
