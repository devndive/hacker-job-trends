We&#x27;re first movers to bring the power of photo-realistic visualizations to the hands of consumers and our engineering team has been the driving force behind this Modsy magic. Check out modsy.com&#x2F;portfolio and see if you can tell which of our images on our site are real vs. renderings (hint: they are all renderings).<p>We&#x27;re looking to hire 3D Web, Full Stack, and Machine Learning engineers.  We&#x27;d also love to talk to anyone who leans more toward pure front or back end engineering.  Our stack is React&#x2F;Redux&#x2F;WebGL + Django&#x2F;Python.<p>Our interview process, like our company, moves quickly with an emphasis on creating a personal connection from the first encounter.  We do a phone&#x2F;in-person interview with the Head of Engineering (me), phone call with one of our engineers, and then a half day in office to meet the team before making an offer.<p>Our product is brought to life by a diverse and talented group of engineers, artists, designers and creators.  You can read more about our founder, Shanna, and our team at modsy.com&#x2F;about-us.<p>Drop me a line at juan@modsy.com if you&#x27;re interested to learn more!","time":1493657195,"type":"comment"}
