Founded by Harvard undergrads, Pagedraw solves the problem of time wasted writing HTML and CSS code.<p>At the core, we are a compiler that takes as input designer mockups and outputs fully semantic, production ready code (for React, Angular, Ruby on Rails, you name it).<p>If your team uses React, for example, Pagedraw automatically generates the render function of all your components, from the views drawn by designers. As a developer we believe you should work only at a data level, taking care of the state of the app without worrying about whether something is vertically centered or not. We&#x27;ve raised over $1.2M from investors like Lightspeed, SVAngel, and Charlie Cheever.<p>The problem we’re solving is not necessarily a new one, but it’s very hard, and we need smart, passionate people who want to join our mission of making the development of apps better for everyone.<p>For more info, read our blog post at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@gablg1&#x2F;pagedraw-is-hiring-9e69cccade83#.h81p3d9ag\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@gablg1&#x2F;pagedraw-is-hiring-9e69cccade83#....</a> Our interview process consists of a series of informal conversations (technical and non-technical) with the members of our team, as well as a take home coding assignment.<p>Send your resume to jobs@pagedraw.io and mention Hacker News.","time":1493683861,"type":"comment"}
