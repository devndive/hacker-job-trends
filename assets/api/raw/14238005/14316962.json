Don&#x27;t worry about a cover letter -- send me a resume and let&#x27;s start the conversation from there.<p>DarkVision Technologies Inc. has developed a new ultrasound-based imaging technology used to inspect the inside of oil and gas wells to improve well integrity and minimize environmental impacts. The company’s field-ready hardware has been designed from the ground up including the ultrasound transducers (designed and built on-site), the mechanical housing (a 15,000-psi pressure vessel) and the electronics (a custom FPGA and arm SoC Architecture running an embedded Linux).  Our image processing pipeline processes up to 20 Gbits of data every second to create datasets that can be used to find small cracks in wells that can be many kilometers long.  Our team consists of experts from machine vision, medical imaging, aerospace, and computer graphics sectors.  With several of North America’s largest oil and gas companies already secured as early customers, DarkVision’s flagship product is now making its debut in the field.  We’re not a typical oil and gas service company. We’re not your typical &#x27;app 2.0&#x27; or LOB company. And we&#x27;re not a 20-year science experiment that never delivers a product of value. What we are is a technology company that has chosen to solve a critical and real problem for one of the largest industries in the world. We combine the right balance of big-picture thinking with pragmatic plans to develop technology that leaves the lab, and works in the real world to solve our customers’ problems.<p>We are seeking to recruit a talented C++ engineer to develop our embedded, desktop and cloud applications.
