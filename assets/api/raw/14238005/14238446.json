Our CEO said during our last earning call that strategy has changed. eBay needs ads that keep people on eBay and offer better choices for our buyers. We are the team blowing up the old strategy and doing something better. You can move the needle when it comes to eBay&#x27;s profit. We operate like a small startup but can impact eBay&#x27;s 100+ million buyers. This is a unique opportunity to learn search engine and recommendation technology which rank eBay&#x27;s 1+ billion active items. We apply cutting edge machine learning techniques on petabytes of data and thousands of Spark&#x2F;YARN nodes. This includes deep learning, XGBoost and multi-arm bandits. Our interview consists of two phone screens. Then you come onsite to meet the team and do a code test.\n5+ years of Machine Learning experience preferred\njobs@ebaynyc.com | Ask for Mr. Lawn","time":1493653357,"type":"comment"}
