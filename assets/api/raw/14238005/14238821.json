Their three systems track the flow of an order placed on their website, through their warehouse, and to the point of delivery. Each system uses its own database (MySQL for the shop, PostgreSQL for the warehouse, etc.). The systems communicate to each other via API calls (that are not shown here).<p>Please review the model and be prepared to discuss it with us. When we talk, we&#x27;ll ask you how you would answer queries about this fictional business. These will be high-level questions and not deeply technical. We&#x27;ll also want to hear your opinion of the model, its limitations, and how it could be improved.<p>1. Write a query to count the number of products across all orders received by the warehouse system today (the PostgreSQL database).<p>2. Given an order_id, how would you find its last GPS coordinates?<p>3. What do you think is the most serious problem among these systems, and why? (We are not looking for a specific answer, we want to know what <i>you</i> think is a problem.)<p>4. Why do you think this fictional company chose Redis for their delivery system, and is it a good choice?","time":1493655363,"type":"comment"}
