That makes it the #3 cause of death, just behind heart disease and cancer (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;health-shots&#x2F;2016&#x2F;05&#x2F;03&#x2F;47663618...\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;health-shots&#x2F;2016&#x2F;05&#x2F;03&#x2F;47663618...</a>). This is a major societal catastrophe - and it needs to be fixed. Part of the solution is the long-overdue modernization of our nation&#x27;s health IT infrastructure. This is CareEvolution&#x27;s mission - to create better patient outcomes by modernizing - and connecting - our health IT systems.<p>There are many interesting things to do at CareEvolution, including mobile, web, platform, integration, devops, analytics, ETL... and lots more. This is a place where you help define what it is you want to do, and how to help the world.<p>We&#x27;re a small team - still under 100 people (and all technical!) - but our platform manages health data for over 130 million people.<p>Check out our job listing at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;39897&#x2F;developers-for-healthcare-software-platform-careevolution\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;39897&#x2F;developers-for-healthca...</a><p>Visit our website at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.careevolution.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.careevolution.com&#x2F;</a><p>Submit resumes to resume@careevolution.com","time":1504288477,"type":"comment"}
