We were just tired of spending time building and maintaining data pipelines. Then we noticed, so is everyone else! That is why we&#x27;ve created an intuitive ETL tool that easily enables the data analysts themselves to integrate data from any source. This way data analysts can do their most significant work faster than ever before.<p>Now we are looking to add engineers to our core engineering team to help build the infrastructure that modern data teams depend on to create and operate their data warehouse! It shouldn&#x27;t take a CS degree to use big data effectively, and abstracting away the difficult parts is our mission.<p>What we want to see in you: - You love data engineering - You build robust and scalable data systems three times as fast as other developers - Coding in Java is second nature to you - You have a passion for improving data analytics - You’re excited to work in a scrappy environment - You’re down to earth and fun to be around. This is an absolute must!<p>Big plus if you have the following: - Have experience with Cascading, Docker, and AWS - Know the ins and outs of current big data frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, or Flink, but this is not an absolute requirement, as you&#x27;re a quick learner! - Have startup experience<p>More details here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;etleap.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;etleap.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a><p>To apply, send your resume to jobs@etleap.com.","time":1504282948,"type":"comment"}
