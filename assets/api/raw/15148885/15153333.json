We are a small, yet growing, team, passionate about travel and building better technology for the sharing economy. We power the pricing for hundreds of thousands of listings across the globe. If you search for a place on Airbnb in any major market, a Beyond Pricing customer is likely in the first page of results.<p>Our current stack is Django and Ember.js, but experience in any specific technology isn&#x27;t required. We especially would love to hear from you if you have started your own startup before, and if you&#x27;ve been an airbnb host. No coding challenges - just share with us something that you&#x27;ve built that you&#x27;re proud of.<p>We&#x27;re well-funded and profitable. We offer flexible work hours, significant equity, competitive salary, equipment budget, medical, dental, vision and 401k.<p>Email us at jobs@beyondpricing.com","time":1504311208,"type":"comment"}
