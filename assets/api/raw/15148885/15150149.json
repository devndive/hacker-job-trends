We know a growing number of people want flexibility when and variety where they work. We know businesses – small ones in particular – really struggle to find staff. We make life better by connecting those people with those businesses. Our industry focus is food retail – we got our start in the vibrant street food and pop-up scene. And we are London based, growing fast and backed by a top-shelf VC and angel investors.<p>We want to build a mobile app for iOS and Android devices. This will allow us to streamline the process of engaging the individuals doing jobs on our platform (e.g., inviting them to jobs and confirming hours). You will be responsible for developing our Android and iOS app from scratch using the technologies you see fit. React Native seems like a good option, but we’re open to alternative approaches.<p>Experience:<p><pre><code>  - iOS and Android development\n  - React and&#x2F;or React Native experience\n</code></pre>\nNice-to-have:<p><pre><code>  - UI&#x2F;UX experience\n  - Web&#x2F;full-stack development experience\n  - Ruby&#x2F;Rails, AWS, Docker, Git\n  - CS degree\n  - Startup experience\n</code></pre>\ncareers+hn@hirehand.co.uk","time":1504284403,"type":"comment"}
