We&#x27;re a small team (currently 4 full-time, 1 part-time) who just went through the most recent batch in YC. You’d have a chance to work closely with the founders, have lots of opportunity for growth, and have an immediate and large impact in our company’s trajectory. We offer competitive pay and benefits, in addition to equity.<p>Contract Simply (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;contractsimply.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;contractsimply.com</a>) helps banks manage their construction loan payments. Construction loans have a complicated payments process where payments are broken up into monthly disbursements called “draws”. This process is currently managed with excel, pdfs, and emails. We’ve built a system that makes this whole process simpler, faster, and less prone to errors.<p>We value transparency, mastery, and, above all, getting things done.<p>Our stack is currently a Rails backend and React frontend, hosted on AWS and managed via Opsworks. Bonus points if you have experience with one or all of those, but it’s not a hard requirement.<p>Email me at andrew@contractsimply.com if you&#x27;re interested in learning more.","time":1504284953,"type":"comment"}
