Our tools process millions of patient records to predict what kinds of medical risk and problems will befall a patient and other medically relevant parameters. Join us to learn about the many intricacies of medical data, how to handle very large volumes of patient records, and how to build pipelines to operationalize cutting-edge machine learning models.<p>Data Engineer: We work mostly in Python, Scala with some Java here and there. Main technologies include Spark, TensorFlow and Hadoop among others. We&#x27;re looking to build more robust pipelines to transform raw, often human-entered data into standards-compliant forms, and to deploy a wide variety of machine learning&#x2F;AI models in a scalable, traceable manner.<p>System Administrator: We handle very private data, so security and compliance with health industry standards is a must. Come learn how to meet the stringent requirements to be a responsible caretaker for sensitive health data. We manage our own cluster, running a variety of &quot;big-data&quot; tools. We&#x27;re looking to streamline our infrastructure while building it out, adding off-site capabilities, and implementing strong disaster recovery and security protocols.<p>Odds and ends: mostly onsite in lovely downtown San Mateo but flexible hours. Free lunch, work from home Wednesdays, ~20 employees, growing in a field that really affects people&#x27;s lives.<p>Contact Nicolas at ntilmans <i>at</i> lumiata.com","time":1504308355,"type":"comment"}
