I&#x27;m looking for two talented developers looking to work remotely full-time building distributed real-time applications using:<p>* React&#x2F;Redux&#x2F;Webpack \n* Python(Django) \n* Postgres&#x2F;Redis \n* AWS&#x2F;S3&#x2F;Ubuntu&#x2F;etc.<p>You need to have a degree in a technical subject, and you are going to need to pass our programming exams. Located in or near NYC a plus, but it shouldn&#x27;t matter for the right candidate. Unfortunately, these are not junior level positions - so please only apply if you have many years architecting complicated web apps. Also, for legal reasons, this project requires US citizenship. Thank you!<p>For more info: joseph dot misiti @ mathandpencil.com","time":1504283286,"type":"comment"}
