We have fleets of autonomous cars in Singapore and Boston.<p>Yes, the first time you will be riding on a self-driving car, it will be a terrifying experience, with the spooky wheel that moves by itself: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=iP_lAjIfZwU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=iP_lAjIfZwU</a>\nThe second time, we hope it will feel boring, which means that we achieved our objective to create a comfortable and predictable and overall safe car.<p>We are growing rapidly, and have many job opportunities. Here you can see a sample: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nutonomy.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nutonomy.com&#x2F;careers</a><p>But really, rather than &quot;filling opening positions&quot;, we are looking for excellent candidates that will do exceptional work. When these smart people join, it&#x27;s them who tell us what they need to do. So I encourage you to get in touch even if no listed position corresponds to your profile.<p>In particular, there are needs that we have but hard to describe without giving away too much of our secret plans. These involve problems related to programming languages design, automated synthesis of programs, formal methods, etc. Please get in touch if you are a senior person in those areas -- even if you don&#x27;t see the connection to autonomous vehicles.<p>Feel free to get in touch with any question (andrea@nutonomy.com). Please do not send requests regarding internships to me; we have a large intern program, but I only deal with senior &amp; research positions.","time":1504291643,"type":"comment"}
