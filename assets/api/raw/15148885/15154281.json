The stack is Django&#x2F;Python&#x2F;Postgres on AWS, and Fastly as a CDN. We&#x27;re a small team right now, at 5 engineers who mostly do Django and 3 who mostly do infrastructure and developer tools.<p>We&#x27;re hiring more in this area because we&#x27;re starting to get some very interesting scaling challenges:<p>- We host over 600,000 highly detailed 3D models of real places captured by our cameras, amounting to over 600TB of data.<p>- We serve over 15 million 3D views every month, which amounts to over 7 billion requests and 300TB of data.<p>Our APIs are used by all parts of the company: 3D data gets uploaded from our cameras, processed by our vision pipeline in C++, Python, and TensorFlow, and consumed by our Javascript&#x2F;WebGL and VR applications. The Backend team makes new additions to the API constantly, and works to ensure the APIs are secure, scale well, and are well tested.<p>More details: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smartrecruiters.com&#x2F;Matterport&#x2F;743999658963008-senior-backend-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smartrecruiters.com&#x2F;Matterport&#x2F;743999658963008-s...</a>","time":1504326750,"type":"comment"}
