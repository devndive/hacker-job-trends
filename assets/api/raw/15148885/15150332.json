Personalized medicine depends upon accurately finding and interpreting our genetic differences. While technological advances have revolutionized our ability to find these differences, genetic tests often fail to interpret these differences, leading to inconclusive results and clinical uncertainty. This is both a limitation of existing data and approaches. Jungla’s strategy unites experts in functional genomics, computational biophysics, and machine learning to develop proprietary solutions for genetic interpretation. The guiding principles at Jungla are rooted in knowledge generation, performance, scalability, and transparency. Our team strives to make genetic tests more useful, faster, and less expensive.<p>What You&#x27;ll Do: Help patients better leverage their genomic information across a wide-array of genetic and genomic tests. To achieve this, you will develop new models and systems that learn from diverse and increasingly complex computational and experimental data types. Help establish and promote a culture of engineering excellence.<p>Ownership and Direction: Alongside the cofounders –3 ex-Stanford PhDs and postdocs– you will be instrumental to both problem definition and solution development.<p>Engineering Excellence: You will set the software engineering tone for our small team, establishing continuous integration practices in an agile environment.<p>Technical Development: You will drive architecture, algorithms development and implementation of critical components of Jungla’s ambitious technical roadmap. Improve Healthcare: You will utilize your skills to help develop solutions that will impact patients’ lives.<p>Let&#x27;s Talk If: You know deep learning: You have a thorough grasp of machine learning fundamentals and significant experience building deep learning solutions to various challenging problems. Preferably using the Python data stack with tensor-based programming languages with a focus on deep learning: Tensorflow (preferred), (py)Torch, Caffe, Theano, etc.<p>You are passionate about driving insights from data: You have high-fluency and the equivalent skills of 3+ years of experience in: statistics, machine learning, coding, and answering questions in high-dimensional numerical datasets. Our data is different from established areas of ML&#x2F;DL application (like computer vision or natural language processing), so you’ll need to derive effective hyperparameters and architectures for different learning problems and data types.<p>You care about code: You take pride in development and have a deep understanding of how to write high quality, maintainable, extensible software. You have built tools in a production software engineering environment, including use of automated regression testing, version control, and deployment systems.<p>You own your work: You’re a steward of excellence who can identify, prioritize, manage and execute goals that impact the team’s mission.<p>Why You&#x27;ll Love Working at Jungla: We combine competitive compensation and benefits with the opportunity to work on challenging and worthwhile problems. You will work with an interdisciplinary team at the interface of computer science, biophysics, and genomics, developing elegant technological solutions to improve patient care.<p>We believe that mission-driven teams with diverse skill sets are best positioned to drive impact. We see work as a reflection of our care and love for the world and are passionate about changing the trajectory of healthcare.<p>Values-Driven Culture<p>Team &amp; Growth<p>Send your details to MLjobs@oxeonpartners.com","time":1504285560,"type":"comment"}
