Experience with any of those technologies is a plus, but we&#x27;re open to speaking with strong engineers who will pick things up quickly. Any experience building data-intensive applications is also a plus - we deal with a lot of data :)<p>As we grow, you&#x27;ll be able to take a significant leadership role within our engineering team. You&#x27;ll also have the opportunity to be a member of the team as we go through the Techstars NYC summer session, working alongside some of the most promising startups and talented entrepreneurs in New York.<p>You can apply via AngelList or reach out directly to me at patrick@vitally.io","time":1504285501,"type":"comment"}
