By magic we mean a self learning semantics technology that extracts key data out of different format documents. And how does that make difference - it automates the painful invoice payment, expense tracking or accounting tasks for end-users.<p>As part of a truly autonomous team, you will be free to use our &quot;standard stack&quot; (Java microservices, Spring Boot &#x2F; Dropwizard, RabbitMQ, Cassandra) or anything else you think works better.
