We aim to build a well-rounded team and we&#x27;re looking for engineers with a deep Linux systems background, strong TCP&#x2F;IP networking abilities, and experience building CI&#x2F;CD pipelines. Windows experience is a big plus (we have a small amount of this infra).<p>This is not an entry-level DevOps position; this role requires senior-level skills, proven mentorship experience, and at least six years of experience working in a production environment in an infrastructure&#x2F;DevOps engineer capacity.<p>We&#x27;re a modern infrastructure engineering team and we build many tools in-house, so you will need to demonstrate proficiency in a one of the languages commonly used for infrastructure : Go (strongly preferred), Ruby, Python, or Java. Experience with app containerization (Docker or rkt) and orchestration systems (Kubernetes) is a big plus!<p>Sound interesting? Please reach out to me by applying here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;wealthfront&#x2F;d2e9b730-ebad-4331-ae41-be8a9651f735\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;wealthfront&#x2F;d2e9b730-ebad-4331-ae41-be...</a><p><i></i> US-based remote engineers are encouraged to apply.
