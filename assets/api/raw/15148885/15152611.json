We are a growing company with strong financials, on the top of recently secured series B funding.<p>As we grow the problems faced around scaling our data infrastructure become more acute and so in the last few months we have created a dedicated Data Architecture team and are actively looking to grow the team.<p>The Data Architecture team is responsible for carrying out an in depth analyse of our current and future data needs. Our goal is then to design and implement appropriate data integration and storage solutions. These solutions are often bespoke in house software solutions predominantly built using Clojure, and using a variety of data stores RDBMS (SQL Server, Postgres), Document Oriented storage (AWS DynamoDB), and Data Warehouse columnar storage (AWS Redshift); we don&#x27;t look to limit ourselves to a particular technology stack.<p>Please feel free to reach out to me via HN with further questions. Or if you would like to meet me for a quick chat about the role over coffee that would be great as well.<p>Cheers,\nMichael<p>Job Description: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rokt.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;6C099FACF0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rokt.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;6C099FACF0</a><p>Recent News:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rokt.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;rokt-closes-series-b-funding-round-15-million-lead-by-moelis&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rokt.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;rokt-closes-series-b-funding-round-15-...</a>","time":1504302128,"type":"comment"}
