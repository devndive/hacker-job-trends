We specialize in a holistic approach inspired by HCD and Lean.  Services include CTO consulting, product strategy, engagement strategy, UX&#x2F;UI, and development plus long term BML iterations and maintenance.  We work with large and small companies&#x2F;startups on projects ranging from 1-6 months with 2-6 people on each project.<p>We build full stack web, mobile, physical installations, etc.  Our favorite stack is react&#x2F;redux (more recently GraphQL), Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix (although frequently Rails, Node, etc), and React Native.<p>Working at Blackbird (and consulting in general) is very different from larger product companies.  We operate in very strategic relationships with our clients which gives us a unique opportunity every few months to deep dive into a new interesting understanding of our client&#x27;s business and build ground up new apps where everyone is making major and early contributions.<p>I am a founder so ask me anything!  We&#x27;re looking in particular for mid&#x2F;sr level devs but if there are other aspects of what we do that interest you definitely still hit me up!<p>Email me at contact@blackbird-studios.io","time":1504289975,"type":"comment"}
