We are now preparing to scale the system up significantly and are looking for somebody with concrete Haskell systems experience to work on scaling the system, making it more robust and improving the development and deployment process.<p>The core requirement is experience with Haskell services in production. Nix experience is optional, but would be a plus. We don&#x27;t expect any experience with stochastic optimization, supply chains or retail.<p>You can get more details about this position on [Target.com][1] and more details about the team from the [talk I gave at BayHac][2] this summer.<p>If you have any questions, feel free to ask here or email me at tikhon.jelvis@target.com.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.target.com&#x2F;job&#x2F;sunnyvale&#x2F;haskell-data-engineer&#x2F;1118&#x2F;5382333\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.target.com&#x2F;job&#x2F;sunnyvale&#x2F;haskell-data-engineer&#x2F;...</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0EgHNq6Pej8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0EgHNq6Pej8</a>","time":1504294958,"type":"comment"}
