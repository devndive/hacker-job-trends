We provide an innovative travel service that actually saves people a lot of money on airfare and hotels. We are a group of improvers and frequent travelers. We believe consumers should have more power over how they spend their money. Information = power in our books. We grew tired of the inefficient and expensive process of travel planning so we sought to improve it by creating a lightning fast search portal. We also noticed there were no travel companies that truly worked for the consumers benefit so we changed that.<p><i>If you&#x27;re interested, apply here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;skiplagged.workable.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;skiplagged.workable.com&#x2F;</a> or email us with any questions at apply@skiplagged.com</i>","time":1504278503,"type":"comment"}
