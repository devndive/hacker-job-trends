We teach English to millions of children in more than 30 countries across the world.  We&#x27;ve got a unique mix of social networking with learning, where kids can make friends all over the world to practice their English, with enough help along the way that they&#x27;ll never get stuck.  Children can walk around a 3D village, meeting characters and playing games.  The company is currently expanding from web clients onto tablet and mobile and is extending it&#x27;s products to better fit how kids learn today.<p>Cloud services are essential to what we do, and we&#x27;re looking for server-side developers and sys-ops wanting a challenge, who are comfortable leading a team to build a scalable solution with us which includes messaging, scoring mechanisms, achievements and a whole lot more.  We&#x27;re developing layered services using PHP and Zend Framework, MySQL, noSQL and message queuing among others. Essential skills also should include developing applications for HA and scalability in cloud environments (clustering, replication, load balancing), Linux admin, Apache&#x2F;Nginx, IP networking, network&#x2F;application security, unit testing and release management. An interest in educational products is a must!<p>You can find out more about the company at <a href=\"http://www.littlebridge.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.littlebridge.com</a><p>Send an email to jobs@littlebridge.com, with a CV and a little about yourself and let&#x27;s talk!","time":1375364477,"type":"comment"}
