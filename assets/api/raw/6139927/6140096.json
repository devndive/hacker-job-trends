Full time.<p>We&#x27;ve got plenty of positions in all offices for backend devs, iOS devs, Android devs, and also JS+frontend devs. Check out our job site and drill down:\n<a href=\"https://www.spotify.com/us/jobs/vacancies/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spotify.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;vacancies&#x2F;</a><p>Also, right now I&#x27;m working as an engineer on our backend infrastructure team in NYC and want to specifically call out an opening we have on this team. The role description (at <a href=\"http://spoti.fi/13zEPmT\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;spoti.fi&#x2F;13zEPmT</a>) should give you some idea: my team is building the infrastructure that all devs at Spotify use to build their features and services on top of. Great way to make a big impact, and also involves playing with a lot of fun tech like Cassandra, LXC, and Docker :-)<p>I&#x27;ve been at Spotify for a year and a half and it has been a great place to work as a developer. Let me just list the ways:<p><pre><code>    - Really smart people with very diverse professional and cultural backgrounds.\n    - Problems that are actually pretty tough &amp; challenging at scale.\n    - A hacker culture, where solving or building things is what&#x27;s valued.\n    - Getting to travel between our offices and exploring new places.\n    - Speaking of travel, 4-5 weeks of vacation depending on your location.\n    - Excellent events with great music and bands (look up &quot;Spotify Sessions&quot;)!\n</code></pre>\nWe also have all the standard benefits and things you&#x27;d expect (nice offices, health insurance, coffee, etc.), but those things above are what I think have really made working here unique.<p>Feel free to reach out to me directly (rohan@spotify.com) if you have any questions or want to talk, or feel free to fire off an application through the jobs site.","time":1375363417,"type":"comment"}
