Currently, PHP, Nginx, Apache, Memecache, MySQL, jQuery, a dash of PostGRES. Future? Likely some Python, maybe Go, maybe Redis, maybe some NodeJS. Whatever makes sense.<p>There will be some machine learning stuff, some big data, some UX challenges, etc. The ideal person is someone who is passionate about making online publishing better; who has track record of leading teams to ship quickly without burnout; and who wants to learn more - but doesn&#x27;t make stack decisions based on the cool new tool they want to learn.<p><a href=\"http://contextly.com/jobs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;contextly.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a><p>What we offer: a fun challenge working on a product used by millions daily, great co-workers, significant equity.<p>There&#x27;s no timeframe on the hiring, so if it&#x27;s something that sounds good for 3 months from now, drop us a line.<p>Put CTO in the subject line and tell us a bit about yourself. info@contextly.com.","time":1375391433,"type":"comment"}
