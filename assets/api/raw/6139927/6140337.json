We have ~3.5mm users, send ~6bn emails&#x2F;month, and sit at ~80k queries&#x2F;second hitting our dozens of database shards during a typical day. We are growing rapidly, adding 7000+ new users&#x2F;day with that rate increasing every week. On the infrastructure side we do some neat stuff to support that scale and growth rate, working closely with developers to build and support our applications.<p>The engineering teams are still small, our benefits are unmatched, and internally we function much like a startup aside from established stability and abundant resources. There are no sales people, no investors, no board, no phones, no useless meetings, and engineering teams are trusted to make good decisions with resources with minimal oversight.<p>If interested, use the links above to apply. Your information will come directly to me.","time":1375365787,"type":"comment"}
