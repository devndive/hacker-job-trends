The same container that a developer builds and tests on a laptop can run at scale, in production, on VMs, bare metal, OpenStack clusters, public clouds and more.<p>---<p>Convinced? Then fork the repo on github (<a href=\"https://github.com/dotcloud/docker\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dotcloud&#x2F;docker</a>) and have a look at the code. Not convinced? Then check the website (<a href=\"http://www.docker.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.docker.io&#x2F;</a>), which contains more details, demos, and screencasts. Excited about this? Then join our engineering team!<p>Your responsibilities will include:<p>* being a full-time contributor to the docker project, which means contributing patches, and reviewing and merging pull requests from the community;<p>* participate in product discussions, influence the roadmap, and take ownership and responsibility over new projects to make them happen.<p>You can qualify if you...:<p>* can read and write Go code (because docker itself is in Go);<p>* can read and write Python code (because many tools and services built around docker are in Python);<p>* are familiar with network protocols: the lower layers like IP, TCP, and UDP; and the higher layers like HTTP;<p>* have experience in scaling large applications;<p>* believe that writing unit and functional tests is important.<p>---<p>Contact: Sam Alba &lt;sam@dotcloud.com&gt;","time":1375402224,"type":"comment"}
