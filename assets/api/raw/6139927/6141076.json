We have a massive amount of data to show users and need someone to develop new ways of presenting and interacting with it. Our current user interfaces are written in GWT, so experience with Java and css are important.<p>The software you write at Codified will directly influence healthcare decisions for thousands of patients. We do clinical genomic variant analysis. We take whole-exome sequence data and predict clinical outcome for the variants we observe in patients, which is then used by clinicians to inform treatment. To do this, we aggregate large amounts of additional data on individual genes and variants, and apply a series of proprietary algorithms.<p>A willingness to learn is more important to us than a Biology background, but the job will require you to become familiar with the Biology that we&#x27;re working with.<p>Send resumes &#x2F; portfolios to codifiedgenomics@gmail.com","time":1375371889,"type":"comment"}
