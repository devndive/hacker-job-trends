Now we&#x27;re the defacto and the likes of xbox and valve are realizing that and working very closely with us. This type of growth needs support!<p>Devops Engineers - We&#x27;re scaling at an insane rate! 3mm MAU increase over the last couple of months, up from 2mm MAU a few months ago, which was up from 1mm MAU a few months prior to that! As such nearly every aspect of our stack is being revved, automated and improved. We&#x27;re looking for people that never do things three times, it is always scripted and solid by then. Come help us build intelligent request routing into our infrastructure, help us get our server build and deploy process down to a work of beauty. Everything is up for grabs here for the right candidates.<p>Data Architects - Do you dream about large volumes of data? We have it! We&#x27;re looking for engineers with tried and tested experience of modern storage mechanisms to help us scale out all data related things. Our vision is to have you build the platform for our stats guy (an absolute baller!) to go to town on. We want to build platforms that help us both with real time queries (recommendations for channels &#x2F; vods, etc, to watch) and longer bulk queries (cohort analysis).<p>Interested in either?
