We&#x27;re disrupting a $2bn industry with a 50% dissatisfaction rate through a platform that allows employees to learn more by learning together. Our platform incorporates educational resources from across the web (think MOOCs and the like) with a company&#x27;s own internal content to provide employees with a comprehensive learning catalogue. Add a social layer on top of that, and we&#x27;re building the next gen of LMS (learning management systems).<p>We&#x27;re bootstrapping and have already signed a Fortune 200 company with 30,000+ employees as our first customer. They signed on board before we even had the product finished, which shows the demand for this type of platform!<p>We&#x27;re a team of 2 at the moment (the founders) and are offering excellent pay and equity for our first engineering, full-time hire (full stack engineer is a huge plus). Any hire will be core to influencing the direction of our product and business. Cultural fit is highest priority. We work in WeWork in NYC and are looking for someone who we&#x27;ll enjoy hanging out with as much as working with. Skills in any of the following are a plus, but seeing as how we are education based, if you aren&#x27;t fully versed in all of these, no worries. Come learn here!<p>* Rails<p>* AngularJS (we use it heavily!)<p>* PostgreSQL<p>* Phonegap&#x2F;Mobile development<p>* Coffeescript&#x2F;Sass&#x2F;Haml<p>* Past experience in API development<p>To apply, email me your Github or links to past work at jamie@pathgather.com. This is a great opportunity to get in at the ground floor of a very promising (and already profitable) early-stage startup!","time":1375380244,"type":"comment"}
