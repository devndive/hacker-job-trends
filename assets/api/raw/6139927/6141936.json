However, an extremely small number actually have a revenue-generating, scalable, profitable business model (we do.)  CredSpark will fix the currently-broken way in which younger workers in many fields gain recognition for their skills and advance their careers.<p>Currently have one part-time engineer building the 1.0 version, and we&#x27;re seeking another Ruby&#x2F;Rails engineer to join the project. Our platform is built on Rails 3 with Javascript, deployed to Heroku, and version control is via Github. Tests are written in RSpec and run via continuous integration, and we track all of our stories in Pivotal Tracker. Our initial version is targeted toward desktop browsers, but we&#x27;re looking to implement a responsive design in v2.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, please drop us a line at jobs@credspark.com.","time":1375378179,"type":"comment"}
