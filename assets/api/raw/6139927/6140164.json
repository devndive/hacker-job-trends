We&#x27;re looking for North American web developers or PeopleSoft developers who are looking to push the platform. We work with Fortune 500 companies and some big name higher ed institutions alike, using copious amounts of HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;Javascript to create beautiful, usable PeopleSoft implementations. We were recently profiled by the PeopleSoft blog. Competitive salary, smart co-workers, great projects. If interested, shoot over a resume to careers@intrasee.com. (Note that you don&#x27;t have to have PeopleSoft experience, we&#x27;re willing to train great devs.) Thanks.","time":1375364028,"type":"comment"}
