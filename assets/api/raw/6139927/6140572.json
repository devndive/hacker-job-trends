We&#x27;re approaching hiring with a &quot;smart people first, skills second&quot; mindset, so get at us. Agency experience is not required.<p>RTO+P is a full-service ad shop based in Philadelphia. Last week, we won Ad Age&#x27;s &quot;Small Agency of the Year (11-75 Employees)&quot; award. We serve clients like Under Armour, NBC Universal, Planet Fitness and more.<p>Brooklyn positions: We operate a small development outpost in DUMBO, Brooklyn - currently just yours truly and a few open desks waiting to be coded upon. From Brooklyn, you&#x27;ll also be a part of a larger - but still small - organization of intensely creative pros. Some travel, mainly to Philadelphia, every couple weeks, should be expected (with costs fully covered, of course).<p>Please contact me at interactivejobs@redtettemer.com","time":1375367881,"type":"comment"}
