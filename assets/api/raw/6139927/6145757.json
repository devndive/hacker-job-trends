We need someone to help us build a slick, seamless iOS app to show off our awesome physics. If you want to push the frontiers of computer graphics, work with brilliant researchers, and build a game with the most beautiful interactive 3D liquids the world has ever seen: come talk to us!<p>Our team is three professors and a Ph.D. student, from CMU and Berkeley. We have a track record of producing great research, with six SIGGRAPH papers among us this year alone. This is a research project, not a company, but we do have a reasonable budget. If all goes well, we&#x27;ll be presenting this project at SIGGRAPH next year.<p>If you write fantastic iOS apps, are interested in computer graphics, and (ideally) have some experience with video on iOS, you should get in touch!<p>Send an email to mlstanto@cs.cmu.edu with your resume and tell us a bit about why you’re interested.","time":1375428324,"type":"comment"}
