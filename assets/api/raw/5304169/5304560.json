We've been around for six months now, have funding and revenue, and are looking to grow the team. (More about our personal backgrounds on the site - <a href=\"http://geteasypost.com.\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://geteasypost.com.</a>)<p>At EasyPost we often receive bad data from our shipping providers. For instance, SuperShipper (carrier's name anonymized for the purpose of this post) may tell us it costs $0 to ship a package from San Francisco to New York. What a steal! Sadly, this isn't the rate that gets charged our customers at the end of the day we, not SuperShipper, look like idiots.<p>We are interested in how you would solve this problem. Would you ask the user to check back later? Estimate the rate based on given data? Or do something entirely different?<p>Sound interesting?
