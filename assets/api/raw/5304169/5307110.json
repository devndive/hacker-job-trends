Want to make a difference? I, along with another MIT Media Lab grad, work at Essess and we're hiring.<p>We looking for coders, building scientists, and computer vision experts.<p>About our company: Forbes called us the \"Google Street View of energy efficiency\". We use thermal cameras to map energy leaks at city scales to help our customers make smart decisions about their energy use.<p>Our first product, launching in the next month, is a home energy report that will allow home owners to literally see the heat leaking from their homes, allowing them make informed decisions about possible improvements.<p>Here's our big idea: In the coming years, we want to create a nationwide energy market to allow us to identify properties that would benefit the most from an energy efficiency upgrade.<p>We would offer free home improvements to homeowners. In return, the homeowner agrees to a fixed energy bill for some period of time. The homeowner, instead of paying the utilities directly, would pay us and in return would receive a lower, predictable monthly energy bill.<p>Our mission is to build and drive this market. We're excited about using technology to help the environment and help people live more comfortable, less-impactful lives.<p>That's our ideaâ€¦ but we need your help make it a reality.<p>Come talk to us! Email phil@essess.com for more details.<p>And, for those interested, here's an example image: <a href=\"http://imgur.com/tmWRh5Y\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://imgur.com/tmWRh5Y</a>","time":1362174021,"type":"comment"}
