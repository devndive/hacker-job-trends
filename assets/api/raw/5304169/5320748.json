We want colleagues who are smart and get things done, who are inveterate builders, tinkerers and detectives. We hire people not experience levels, so we have a place for you whether you have been building real-time trading systems for a decade, or are fresh out of school.<p>MarkITx is a B2B exchange for buying and selling IT hardware (anything that goes into a datacenter). We are disrupting the $350B secondary IT market by bringing simplicity and transparency to a process that is currently painful, ugly and untrustworthy. We are a funded startup, working out of 1871. We are a very talented, deeply experienced and tight-knit team. We have some of the best backers and advisors in Chicago. We’ve proven the model, with over $20MM in orders and over $150k per week in transactions, roughly doubling every month. We’re just getting started, and we need your help to scale that.<p>Building a commodities exchange from scratch is an unique challenge. Working with a world class team of designers, front-end developers and industry experts, you will build the beating heart of our trading platform. You will become an expert in every layer of our stack, including Node.js, ElasticSearch, Redis and AWS. You’ll integrate with dozens of APIs from services like FedEx, Dwolla, Dropbox and NetSuite. You’ll help build and document our own API so that our users can tap directly into the exchange.<p>If that sounds like fun, see the details at <a href=\"https://www.markitx.com/careers#engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.markitx.com/careers#engineer</a>","time":1362429650,"type":"comment"}
