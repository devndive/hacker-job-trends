You don't have the source and you don't know them! Is this the 'correct' version of angry birds to approve? What about this BoA app?<p>We give them information on what apps do - 'does it talk to twitter? does it use this ad sdk? does it send out sms? to this particular number?' How? Through static/dynamic analysis and other solutions.<p>If your idea of fun is implementing an arm instruction set or you aren't afraid of terrabytes of smali output you should talk to us.<p>If you like having to middle ssl traffic on emulators to reverse a non-public API so that you can create 1000 fake accounts you should talk to us.<p>If you don't mind converting a 300k json blob of crap into 64bits of bliss we'd like to talk to you.<p>We might be an enterprise company where your options are actually worth a crap, but we still have the horse masks, the poker chips, and full bar just like everyone else.<p>What are you waiting for!?
