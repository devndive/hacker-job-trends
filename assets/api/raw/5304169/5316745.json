Looking for both front and backend engineers. We work with Java, Grails and Hibernate. We just started subscribing users and will open the site to the public in a little more than a week (will also announce funding soon). Investors call us \"the linkedin for products\". This is my second significant startup (first one - Discretix - provides security to the Samsung Galaxy phones). \nWe all work remote so you can be anywhere but we'd love to have you in SF, if possible. \nCompensation is 80-110K based on your experience and location. write to me at limor.elbaz@peerlyst.com","time":1362373610,"type":"comment"}
