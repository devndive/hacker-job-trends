Our services enable users to shop for car insurance and renters insurance online, immediately retrieving accurate and actionable rates from partnered insurance carriers. Our customers can then purchase one of the policies directly from us via our licensed insurance agents.<p>We have just raised a $4.5 million Series A and are filling out our staff. Our intention is to add more lines of insurance (homeowners, motorcycle, umbrella) as well as tools which make managing insurance policies more pleasant.<p>As a Software Engineer you will be a full-stack Rails developer who works in a small team of fellow coders. Your manager will be an experienced developer. Here you will be able to sharpen your Rails skills and put them to good use.<p>Our environment is comfortable. Aside for very rare pushes, nobody works more than 40 hours. We encourage our employees to work from home once a week.<p>Tools we would like applicants to be somewhat knowledgable in: Ruby on Rails, MySQL, JavaScript/CoffeeScript, CSS/SCSS. We develop on Macs, but this is not a necessity. We use the standard Test::Unit testing framework which is bundled with Rails, and we do not enforce anything like TDD.<p>If you are interested, please send an email to joel@coverhound.com with your info.
