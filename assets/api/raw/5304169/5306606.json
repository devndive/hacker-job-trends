(Software engineers: primarily scala, javascript)<p>We're pushing the envelope on writing high-performance and pragmatic software in Scala. We're in the real-time ad-tech space, which means that we make decisions on lots of data, very quickly (95th percentile latency ranges between 5-15ms on 100k qps for one of our main services, and we can maintain the same stats if we take down half of our servers). We also are rebuilding our analytics platform to provide ever-richer insights into this aggregate data.<p>If you're a front-end wizard{,ess}, we also have interesting and challenging work for you! Create intuitive visualizations of key performance metrics. Make it simple for account managers to tweak dozens (hundreds?) of possible settings in our backoffice app. You will be instrumental in driving design decisions.<p>tl;dr -&#62; engineering-driven organization with fantastic people and growth.<p>Say hello -&#62; toby at tapad dot com","time":1362168055,"type":"comment"}
