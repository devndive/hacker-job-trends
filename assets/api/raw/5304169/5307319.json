We're a venture backed startup in the online payments/advertising space and service hundreds of millions of impressions per day. We work on getting users to try new products and services, play new games, and visit new stores by giving them stuff that they already want for free (e.g. free movie tickets if you sign up for Zipcar, free Facebook credits if you sign up for Gamefly, and so on). In addition, with the advent of a huge Visa investment, we're working on completely changing the nature of offline commerce by connecting it with the online world -- with our help, brick and mortar businesses can draw causal links between their online advertising campaigns and offline sales and answer burning questions like, “Did that old-timey looking product photo we posted last week actually get people in our store?”<p>We have great revenue, we respect great ideas no matter where they come from, and in general, the consensus here is that we work with the smartest people we've ever met.<p>Sound cool?
