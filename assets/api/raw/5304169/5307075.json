Gyms do not work for 89% of Americans, but yet they are a $21B industry thanks to recurring fees. We are trying to change that by bringing the Gym to your home over live video and eliminating waste. If the country gets a little more fitter using our platform, thats all the more good.\nWe want you to come help us engineer this transition. We are doing what AirBnb, Uber and others did with excess capacity in their markets to fitness professional market. \nOur customers love us. Every 2 out of 3 users who works out with one of our trainers comes back for more. We just recently launched Group workouts. We just graduated from Rock Health and have some great investors who get marketplaces like us. We make money when users pay to workout with a trainer. And our prices are a fraction of the gym costs thanks to efficiencies we provide.\nWe use our own platform to keep ourselves healthy. No one has yet got a six-pack but we could probably all run long distance. We are small team, so your impact and influence on our culture will be huge. We love the Netflix philosophy of context and control.\nOur technical stack is Python and MySQL. We also use Fabric, NGinx, Apache, Celery, Redis and RabbitMQ.\nContact us at dev@wello.co.","time":1362173585,"type":"comment"}
