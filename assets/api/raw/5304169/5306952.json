PBS NewsHour (<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/</a>)<p>We are hiring a news developer which is part of a two-person reporting team. We have a very high amount of support from the top to pursue ambitious projects and the data team is positioned to have latitude within the organization. It is a great opportunity for a developer to break into the news business and create a name for themselves. We also have the unique ability produce to data projects that would appear on broadcast and run as a second screen experience. We have a node.js project setup and are ready for the right person to put it to good use.<p>We are just starting a redesign process which should last about 4 months. This site will be looking great, running WordPress and be (mostly) responsive in July.
