In a nutshell, we create friendlier, faster, and cheaper versions of popular enterprise software. We're currently working on Gander, a mobile-friendly mail app for the modern enterprise. We also built Timberwolf, an open-source application for Exchange mail analysis.<p>We're currently running a METEOR stack on top of Node.js, with straight Ruby for services on the back end. This is all supported by a Mongo database.<p>At Riparian, we welcome all manner of ideas, beliefs, hobbies, diets, and toaster oven preferences. Most of us work from around 10-6, some of us work from 9-5 or 8-4. We like Agile, though we've been to Niagara. Some of us have our own offices, some of us share offices, some of us work in the open office. There are no hammocks, but there is a nap room. Attending conferences and taking classes is encouraged. Amassing new skills is encouraged. Voicing your opinion is encouraged.<p>Interested in Meteor, maybe interested in meeting us?
