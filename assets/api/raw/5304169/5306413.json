We only accept the best students, teach them the basics of web development and help find a job as a junior software developer. We're expanding, so we're looking for additional teachers.<p>Teaching is hard but very rewarding and enjoyable. We're looking for contractors (10+ weeks) experienced with Ruby, Rails and related technologies who can not only write beautiful code but can explain how they do it.<p>We started Makers Academy to address both growing demand for developers and high unemployment rates. We don't believe in lectures but we spend most time coding (pairing) and the rest of the time doing interactive workshops. The main thing we're teaching is the mindset of a developer, the ability to understand and solve unexpected challenges.<p>We're funded by our parent company, Forward Internet Group (<a href=\"http://www.forward.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.forward.co.uk</a>). Our pay is competitive (not to mention usual perks like massage, video games and breakfasts)<p>If you'd like to know more about why we started Makers Academy and how we teach, please email me at evgeny@makersacademy.com.","time":1362166282,"type":"comment"}
