Remote work is possible for exceptional candidates who are US citizens and living in the US - but our office culture is so great that you might really want to be here beside us!<p>Factual's vision is to be an awesome and affordable data provider that enables developers, startups, and big companies to focus on innovation instead of data acquisition. We were recently named one of \"50 Disruptive Companies in 2013\" by MIT Technology Review (<a href=\"http://www2.technologyreview.com/tr50/2013/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www2.technologyreview.com/tr50/2013/</a>).  We have a terrific team that is still fairly small and an incredible CEO who was previously the co-founder of Applied Semantics (which was bought by Google and became AdSense). Factual has venture funding from Andreessen-Horowitz and our partners/customers include Facebook, Yelp, Foursquare, Trulia, and Newsweek.<p>There are many challenging problems to work on at all layers of the stack: data cleaning and canonicalization, storage, deduping, serving, APIs, improving data using machine learning, etc. If you love data, Factual is the place to be. Our main criteria are that you're smart and get things done, but you'll get bonus points for experience with Clojure (<a href=\"http://www.factual.com/jobs/clojure\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.factual.com/jobs/clojure</a>), machine learning, NLP, algorithm design, or Hadoop. Our LA office is our headquarters and our new Palo Alto office is still small, so new hires would have a huge impact on the culture there.<p>You can email me personally at jake@factual.com, or view our job postings and apply directly via Jobvite:<p>Palo Alto Software Engineer: <a href=\"http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oTR1Vfwq&#38;s=Hackernews\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oTR1Vfwq&#38;s=Hackernews</a><p>Los Angeles Software engineer: <a href=\"http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oQR1Vfwn&#38;s=Hackernews\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oQR1Vfwn&#38;s=Hackernews</a><p>Los Angeles Data Engineer: <a href=\"http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oSS1Vfwq&#38;s=Hackernews\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oSS1Vfwq&#38;s=Hackernews</a>","time":1362163929,"type":"comment"}
