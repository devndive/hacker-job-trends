Remote work is unavailable for this role as we have a cool company culture replete in Venice with bikes; surfboards, paddleboards, and no dress code. In Boston, we are at the ultra-modern, fun, and techy atmosphere of a shared startup workspace. Both have no vacation or sick policy (take time when you need).  We work in Python, ROR, and Javascript and seek those who are interested in data, apis, machine learning, tool-building and web-based applications. We pay great rates and have stake available.
