We're not a product/platform company, and aren't in SV, but we do have one hell of a culture, myriad projects, and an unending pipeline of new work. To support that growth, we're planning on adding an additional 100 people during 2011. If you're interested, have questions, or send in a resume, please let me know. I want to make sure anyone coming from HN stands out in our application pool. matt.albiniak at nerdery d0t com<p>Most common thing heard around The Nerdery - \"I learned more here in 3 months than I've learned anywhere else.\" Dog friendly, caffeine provided, developer owned and operated.<p>We have immediate openings for:<p>* Front End Dev - JS knowledge required, jQuery experience preferred.<p>* C# ASP.NET Developer - ASP.NET MVC preferred<p>* PHP Developer - Zend<p>* Actionscript Developer - AS3<p>* IA/UX Designer - previous FED experience<p>* Software Project Manager - you make juggling look easy<p>* IT Systems Technician - we're tech-centric. Not so much \"can you install this\" as much as \"need ____ provisioned.\"<p>* iOS Developer - please hurry.<p>* ExpressionEngine Developer - see above.<p>Oh, and if you're not a great developer but understand tech (like me), we're hiring in sales, too.","time":1296503896,"type":"comment"}
