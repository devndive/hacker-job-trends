Our system saves a lot of energy and we get a ton of sensor information that's lately been leading to some interesting analyses and visualizations..  We're putting physical systems on the web and it's pretty exciting!  There are Engineering openings in our UI, Embedded C++, Test, and Sales Applications groups <a href=\"http://redwoodsystems.com/about-us/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://redwoodsystems.com/about-us/careers</a>.  We're also looking for summer interns if you're still in school (contact me directly).<p>I'm relatively new and it's an awesome time to work here.  We have big name clients in the valley and we're constantly working with them to make a better product.","time":1296584305,"type":"comment"}
