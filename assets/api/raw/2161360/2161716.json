I'm looking for at least one more front-end developer who knows JS inside and out. Experience with FB's new JS SDK is, obviously, a benefit.<p>Our back-end is Java / Jetty / PostgreSQL running on Amazon EC2.<p>We do basically a more advanced version of Facebook's Social Plugins for a number of large websites.<p>We're located in the San Francisco area. Remote work is an option; I work remote from Ohio right now.<p>Everyone works from home on Fridays, and the office is generally a pretty fun place every time I've been out to visit.<p><a href=\"http://www.sociablelabs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sociablelabs.com/</a><p>Contact nathan @ above website if you're interested.","time":1296487575,"type":"comment"}
