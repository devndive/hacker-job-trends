Our backend is developed in-house, with state-of-the-art publishing related features (monitoring of 1000&#x27;s of feeds to detect trending articles, headline and thumbnail A&#x2F;B testing, advanced CTR optimizers...).<p>Since we&#x27;re part of a big media group, some of these tools are now being used by other teams, reaching tens of millions of users every day.<p>We&#x27;d like to bring on board a pragmatic developer.
