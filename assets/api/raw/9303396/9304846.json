That’s Barricade.<p>Positions:<p>- Infrastructure Engineer [Starting at €45,000 and 0.25% equity]<p>- Frontend Engineer [Starting at €40,000 and 0.25% equity]<p>- Data Science Engineer [Starting at €45,000, and 0.25% equity]<p>What we do:<p>We are working at the intersection of amazing user-experience, advanced security and cutting-edge artificial intelligence.<p>Our approach to work is drastically different to other security companies.<p>Every discussion, every feature starts from the customer&#x27;s point-of-view and from a design perspective. We work very hard on understanding the pains, figuring out what our customers want and ultimately give them what they need.<p>We don&#x27;t understand why security products have to be so complex, ugly, expensive, and ill-adapted to today&#x27;s application development and deployment lifecycle.<p>Our goal is to take these complex systems and completely abstract them from the user. Security is hard, managing and responding to security events shouldn&#x27;t be hard.<p>See <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;barricade.io&#x2F;jobs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;barricade.io&#x2F;jobs.html</a> for more information!","time":1427906153,"type":"comment"}
