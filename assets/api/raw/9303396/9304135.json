We do this using a combination of powerful algorithms and human stylists.<p>You&#x27;d be joining a small, highly technical team with a ton of startup experience (the founders have started and sold 2 companies before). You&#x27;ll be one of the first technical hires and get to build and own huge parts of the product and work on the core algorithms.<p>One of our ancillary goals is to build one of the best engineering cultures anywhere, and we&#x27;d love you to help us do that. We launched in October and user and revenue numbers are scaling extremely quickly. We&#x27;re backed by a collection of the top investors from London and Silicon Valley as well as Y Combinator.<p>We&#x27;re especially interested in people who are interested in founding their own startup one day. We view working at Thread as a founder bootcamp where you&#x27;ll learn about all parts of starting and growing a startup.<p>Want to learn more?
