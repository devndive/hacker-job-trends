Hiring full stack software engineers that love Python &amp; the web.<p>CircleUp is building an online investment marketplace that helps non-tech consumer &amp; retail businesses raise the capital they need to expand. These are companies selling products such as greek yogurt, granola bars, energy drinks, footware, athletic gear, baby food, pet care, cosmetics-- something you might buy in a Whole Foods or Costco. Venture Capital firms don&#x27;t invest in these categories, and these deals are still too early-stage for traditional private equity. So these entrepreneurs struggle to raise the money that would help them keep up with demand; at the same time, many investors could benefit from the returns of this asset class, if only it could be made easily accessible.<p>We have been named one of the Top 5 Most Disruptive companies in Finance by CNBC, one of America&#x27;s Most Promising Companies by Forbes, and one of the 50 Best Fintech Innovators by KPMG. We are backed by top-tier investors including Google Ventures &amp; Union Square Ventures.<p>Our stack is Python (Django) + AngularJS. We use some exciting applications of Machine Learning in Python.\nWe are 11 engineers and growing fast. Half the engineering team is in SF, half is remote (distributed across the US). We&#x27;re looking for smart generalists that never stop learning, like working full stack, and are excited to have some impact on the economy outside of silicon valley tech.<p>Help us shape the future of finance!
