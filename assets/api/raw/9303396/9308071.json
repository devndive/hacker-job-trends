It is a best of both worlds, brand recognition and no more fundraising and worrying about stability.<p>Here&#x27;s why you should consider us:<p>We were a team of 4 acquired by Weight Watchers International, a brand recognized by almost everyone, including our moms.<p>We have already built a few products that were launched and are growing under the WW brand.<p>We are looking for engineers with Mobile, Web and Backend expertise. We are also looking for developers who want to have fun with large scale data. Did you know that the WW has been tracking food data from members since since 2003. Imagine the stuff you can build on top of that long history of data.<p>We offer competitive compensation and great health benefits.<p>All 4 of us are staying even after the 1yr mark and now growing because we love what we do and believe in our mission to make people healthier. We have diverse backgrounds (Stanford, Bain, Google, Netflix) and we are looking for you to come join and teach us new tricks!<p>If you are interested, email me at amol dot kher at weightwatchers dot com and we can catch up over phone or coffee.","time":1427936801,"type":"comment"}
