If interested, contact gsieling@wingspan.com.<p>Wingspan Technology is a small, family friendly software company headquartered in Blue Bell, PA. The Wingspan engineering team is responsible for architecture, implementation, and maintenance of the company’s enterprise software products that target highly regulated industries, primarily life sciences. Current projects span the whole software lifecycle, from maintenance of industry-leading solutions to the development of new, unannounced products; some are on-premise and some SaaS.<p>Our engineering team has exposure to a wide range of technology; for new projects we’re using Scala, React, Solr, and Postgres, with an emphasis on functional programming techniques where appropriate. Internally we use Atlassian tools for defect tracking, continuous integration, and code reviews. Engineers involved in tier 3 support typically work with older technologies, but are able to see how real customers use their work.<p>New engineers typically rotate through a series of projects over time. These might include building new UI features in Javascript, writing database migration scripts, or tier 3 support for a SaaS application, depending on the candidate’s interest and experience. Project selection is based around the current needs of our customers, and offers many opportunities to take ownership of projects that have real value to the company.","time":1427896333,"type":"comment"}
