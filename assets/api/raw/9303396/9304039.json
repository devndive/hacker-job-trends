Our technology allows scientists to run virtual experiments on massive compute grids and analyze the resulting large dataset efficiently. Our interface is a single page web app that performs as well as a desktop application.<p>Who We Are:\nWe are passionate engineers, entrepreneurs, scientists, and tinkerers. Our team consists of alumni of great engineering companies (e.g. Google&#x2F;Microsoft), startups, research labs, and biotech companies. Our clients include most large pharmaceutical companies and our investors are fellow technology visionaries, including Bill Gates.<p>Responsibilities:\nWork closely with other engineering team members to scale, architect, and improve the core computational drug discovery platform\nThink outside the box &#x2F; be highly creative\nHelp build reporting interfaces and data feeds\nAsk smart questions","time":1427899868,"type":"comment"}
