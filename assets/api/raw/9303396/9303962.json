While remote is possible, we like people to be in pairs or more, whenever possible. It&#x27;s more fun, anyway.\nWe love these people:<p>1. Go developers; crypto experience a big plus<p>2. Those with platform-specific GUI experience: we&#x27;re currently working on an OSX app and will be expanding to Windows, iOS, and Android soon.<p>3. A Node.js developer who can also do at least some front-end js&#x2F;css&#x2F;html. Our server-side is mostly written in CoffeeScript.<p>4. Designers!<p>If you&#x27;re interested: chris@keybase.io","time":1427899424,"type":"comment"}
