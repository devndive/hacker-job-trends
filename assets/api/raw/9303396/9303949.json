We&#x27;ll be building new products and improving our design and front-end for our current application, future applications, and internal tooling. You&#x27;ll work with a super sharp engineering team (8 of us) accomplishing disproportionately large goals.<p>After 3 years, our main product has hundreds of thousands of active users, and while our front-end is still very nice to work in, I think we have tons of room to improve our front-end process, performance, and mobile friendliness. Come help us make it so.<p>I&#x27;ve got a gist with even more details: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;jpcody&#x2F;f68727f9d6b2e5c86206\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;jpcody&#x2F;f68727f9d6b2e5c86206</a><p>Give that a read, and if you email careers@academicworks.com, it&#x27;ll get to me.
