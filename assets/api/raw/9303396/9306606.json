It&#x27;s stackable, modular, and light enough for a small group to carry and requires no tools to assemble â€”Â perfect for the immediate aftermath of a disaster, when a secure place to sleep can mean the difference between hope and despair.<p>The Exo is also stunningly designed and truly smart, with built-in brains and cutting-edge mesh networking hardware and sensors.<p>Alongside the Exo, we&#x27;re building a software platform to help organizations manage and monitor Exo villages, and that&#x27;s where you come in.<p>We&#x27;re an informal, friendly, and close-knit team deeply driven by our mission to help people using equal parts design and technology.<p><i>-- About the Job --</i><p>We&#x27;re looking for a seasoned engineer who can help us build our backend software platform. You&#x27;ll work on the Rails API that powers our web &amp; mobile client apps, the databases that power the API, and the mesh networking services that allow our platform to talk to our shelters.<p>We&#x27;re committed to continuous deployment and a test-driven development style.<p>Down the road, you&#x27;ll help us ensure our mission-critical systems&#x27; uptimes have enough 9s, build complex mapping applications using geo data, or find a way to make our platform work even for Exo villages with spotty internet connections. We&#x27;ll quickly ramp into some interesting and difficult technical problems.<p><i>-- About You --</i><p>Like us, you love Ruby. You have a solid grasp of the entire web stack: HTTP, RESTful API design, storage systems both relational (Postgres) and not (Redis&#x2F;Cassandra&#x2F;etc). Experience with queues and distributed systems a plus.<p>Although you may spend most of your time on the command-line, you prize thoughtful user experiences and design, and would be excited to work in a design-led organization.<p>You love asking and answering questions, and go out of your way to explain technical matters so that anyone can understand (and feel empowered for asking).<p>Most importantly: you&#x27;re a friendly, effective person who feels deeply drawn to Reaction&#x27;s core mission of helping people all over the world.","time":1427920099,"type":"comment"}
