When our company was acquired by Box in 2013, we launched a new set of developer APIs on the Box platform for anyone (even those who don&#x27;t use Box itself) to use for converting documents to HTML. We&#x27;re now powering apps from LinkedIn to CoTap to the newest version of WebEx.<p>We&#x27;ve also open-sourced one of our biggest projects (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;box&#x2F;viewer.js\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;box&#x2F;viewer.js</a>) and are expanding into developer experience as well.<p>We&#x27;re looking for frontend and full stack engineers to join our close-knit team and help us push the limit of what browsers and mobile devices can do. (Fast, pixel-perfect rendering of documents using just HTML, SVG, and CSS turns out to be really hard!)<p>We&#x27;re also building out a developer experience team and are looking for someone who is passionate about UX, APIs, and making developer tools easy and fun to use.<p>Drop me a note if you&#x27;re interested at long@box.com or matt@crocodoc.com","time":1427902983,"type":"comment"}
