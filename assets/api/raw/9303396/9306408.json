It’s a hard problem to solve and we’ve shrunk the process down from months to minutes.<p>If you want to work someplace that’s just starting to take off but small enough to have a huge impact on its outcome, then we’re at the perfect Goldilocks size for you. The timing is great too: activity on our network is starting to spike and we’re getting great customer feedback on where to take it next.<p>Our development process is best described as “relaxed yet driven”. We have just enough process to keep momentum - big quarterly goals, weekly kickoff and wrapup meetings, team dinners on Wednesday nights, everything’s tracked in Trello - but it’s loose enough to give people the space to get shit done. So it’s more of a trust-based system than some childish flavor of agile. I.e. we don’t do daily standups, enforce pair programming, or have hourly work estimates. Yuck.<p>We’re looking for a senior dev, someone at least backend but ideally fullstack and as comfortable with server admin as they are with writing code. We’re a python&#x2F;django&#x2F;angular shop but honestly we care less about your specific skills than finding someone great, because you’d be more than good enough to pick up new languages anyway.<p>Interested? Great, then email me directly: al@partnered.com","time":1427918409,"type":"comment"}
