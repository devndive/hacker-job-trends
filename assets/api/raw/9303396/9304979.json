We need your help.<p>People from many different backgrounds will be considered, because most of these things have never been done before anyway. What we&#x27;re doing combines Selenium&#x2F;Appium testing, cloud engineering, networking, virtual machines, LXC containers, Android, iOS, python scripting, you name it. If you have a couple of those things under your belt, and you&#x27;re smart and not afraid of doing hard detective work sometimes, I encourage you to apply. Previous work with a small team in a startup environment is preferred.<p>We&#x27;re very active in open source communities.<p>Also, of all the places I&#x27;ve ever worked (including the allegedly &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot; one), this place is the most serious about values and integrity. We have a huge opportunity in front of us, but we also want to work with people who share those values.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saucelabs.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saucelabs.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a>","time":1427907132,"type":"comment"}
