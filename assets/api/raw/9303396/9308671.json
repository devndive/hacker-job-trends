(Mostly Stanford, Google, YCombinator folks) We&#x27;ve learned a ton, and see an opportunity to create software that radically improves how our government serves its people - we&#x27;ve started our company, Nava, to chase that vision.<p>In the last 6 months, we&#x27;ve launched 2 major projects:<p>- App 2.0, the new insurance application for healthcare.gov. It&#x27;s processing 70% of apps coming through the marketplace, and: converts 35% more people than the old app, gets them through in half the time, is mobile-friendly (20% of apps), sits on robust, scalable infrastructure, etc etc. It was the first system that CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service) ever hosted on Amazon AWS.<p>- Scalable Login System (SLS), the new identity management system for healthcare.gov. Sadly, the main achievement here is that the system is actually up and available, unlike its predecessor. It&#x27;s now saving the taxpayer $70M in annual maintenance costs.<p>Here&#x27;s a Wired article from last summer about us:\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;06&#x2F;healthcare-gov-revamp&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;06&#x2F;healthcare-gov-revamp&#x2F;</a><p>Our momentum is strong, the problem is important, and we&#x27;re looking for good people.<p>If you&#x27;re the type that would get fired up about reimagining broken government experiences and technology, please drop us a line at jobs@navahq.com, we&#x27;d love to hear from you!","time":1427948811,"type":"comment"}
