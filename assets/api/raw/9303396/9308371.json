Look at it as the easiest filter you&#x27;ll ever find for resumes. If you <i>really</i> feel need to stress that the job isn&#x27;t for r-emote workers just say &#x27;LOCAL ONLY&#x27; or something like that. Pretty please?<p>@_whoishiring could you add something to that effect to the monthly post?","time":1427942646,"type":"comment"}
