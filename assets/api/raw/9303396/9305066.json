Thousands of families have already signed up to the service and we will be growing enormously this year.<p>But we not only help young people buy Legos and save for bicycles - we are building an awesome technology team that eliminates legacy code, keeps the bug rate tiny, and stays small and joyful. We are doing this by adopting techniques like pair programming, test-driven development, and continuous deployment. You can read more about our plan to be awesome on our tech blog <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.osper.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.osper.io</a>. We want to meet and work with smart technical folks of all sorts - from server-side devs to sysadmins, mobile coders to testers, security analysts to data crunchers - but especially quality and product experts who obsessed with automated and exploratory testing for mobile devices.<p>We are willing to arrange relocation to London for the right candidates. Sorry, we&#x27;re not ready to take on remote team members at this time.","time":1427907731,"type":"comment"}
