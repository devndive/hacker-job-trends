We’re not some food delivery service. We’re one of the fastest-growing companies in town, and we’re doing it solving real problems for everyday Indians. We help everybody do something that’s always been easy for you: find a better job.<p>In the past 6 months, we’ve tripled our revenue, grown from 30 to 90 employees, announced a partnership with Reliance Telecom and Facebook’s Internet.org, and added 8 lakh Job Seekers to our platform. Our servers are busting at the seams.<p>We’ve done all this with a dev team of 6. Code that was meant for 100 users is supporting millions. We need to whip our tech stack into shape, fast. If you love the idea of digging in, rebuilding, redesigning, rearchitecting, -- in short, building this rocket ship the right way before it explodes in a bad way -- let’s get cracking.<p>It’ll be you, and the team, and a whole lot of challenges. Your successes will mean India’s success. And your growth will be our growth, and it’s gonna be huge. We pay well, provide generous equity, and we&#x27;re moving into a new office near MG Road by the end of the month.<p>If this sounds beyond interesting to you, email our CEO Sean Blagsvedt at {first_name}@babajob.com.<p>P.S. Our backend is currently C#, but if you have the talent we’re looking for, you’ll pick it up fast if you haven’t worked with it before, and we may move to something more exciting soon (think Haskell, Go, F#, TypeScript, Clojure). We’re hiring for frontend and Android too.","time":1427899538,"type":"comment"}
