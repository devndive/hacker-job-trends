In the past two years, I&#x27;ve worked with Python, iOS,\n    Angular.js, CoffeeScript, QT, Node, Ruby, Rails, and more.\n\n  - We&#x27;re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.\n    We pair when it makes sense.\n\n  - We practice a sustainable pace. Late nights and &gt; 40 hour weeks are\n    rare by design. For example. last year I worked an average of 40.408 hours per\n    week.\n\n  - We run a makerspace in our building (www.grmakers.com), which gives us\n    access to lots of cool stuff like a laser cutter and 3D printers.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love making software, and you have experience with a variety of technologies.\n\n  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not\n    afraid to use more.\n\n  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m a software developer on this awesome team.
