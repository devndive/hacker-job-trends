There&#x27;s some compelling evidence for it, if you&#x27;d like to chat.<p>Our tech stack is a mix of Go and Java components with Angular on the front end. We use a custom service bus to tie our SOA together, microservices style. We love docker, postgres, riak, automated testing, and continuos integration.<p>As a company, we&#x27;re strong believers in transparency, trust and balance. As an engineering team, we believe good code is easy to read and should have a short &quot;time to understanding&quot;. We expect all of our engineers to continually teach as well as learn. We also believe that everyone should write good code, yet balance that against the need to ship.<p>The company just a year and a bit old, so early enough for non-trivial equity. Despite that we punch above our weight-class with experienced founders, 40+ team members (~ one quarter is engineering), and paying customers.<p>We&#x27;ve got a ton of interesting problems to solve around distributed systems, data analytics and predictions, system reliability, security, privacy and more. We&#x27;re looking for experienced SW engineers up and down the stack, front end, back end, infrastructure, data, dev ops, test, generalist, etc.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;collectivehealth\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;collectivehealth</a><p>We&#x27;re super proud of the company mission, engineering culture and tech stack we&#x27;ve put together and would love a chance to explain it all in detail!","time":1427908832,"type":"comment"}
