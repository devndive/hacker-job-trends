Our technology allows scientists to run virtual experiments on massive compute grids and analyze the resulting large dataset efficiently. Our interface is a single page web app that performs as well as a desktop application.<p>Who We Are:\nWe are passionate engineers, entrepreneurs, scientists, and tinkerers. Our team consists of alumni of great engineering companies (e.g. Google&#x2F;Microsoft), startups, research labs, and biotech companies. Our clients include most large pharmaceutical companies and our investors are fellow technology visionaries, including Bill Gates.<p>You Are:\nA CS hacker that enjoys building large scale user interfaces. You try out the latest web frameworks, ORM’s, and javascript libraries. You build and deploy web apps in your spare time. You care deeply about usability, understand the difference between a power user and a noob (and can simultaneously design an interface for them both!), and obsess over pixel perfection. You have an MVC tattoo. You believe that low test coverage in a UI is for chumps and code reviews, if done correctly, improve end product quality.<p>Responsibilities:\nWork closely with other engineering team members to scale, architect, and improve the core computational drug discovery platform\nThink outside the box &#x2F; be highly creative\nHelp build reporting interfaces and data feeds\nAsk smart questions","time":1427898427,"type":"comment"}
