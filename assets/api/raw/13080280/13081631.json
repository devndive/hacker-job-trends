One of us has written Emacs mode (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ananthakumaran&#x2F;tide\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ananthakumaran&#x2F;tide</a>) which is now linked directly from official TypeScript website. Another one of us, has written tunnelling solution, and used it to create a remote debugging (debug another browser session over the internet), as POC. We have done high pace React re-writes for clients. Picked up tech, when needed (React, Angular 2, Go, Erlang,  Laravel&#x2F;PHP, GStreamer). Switched to Erlang for messaging system. Helped clients with cleaning up a over-engineered micro-service mess. We have written a little more here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.activesphere.com&#x2F;careers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.activesphere.com&#x2F;careers.html</a><p>We are quite lazy at updating our own site, but some of our hacks can be seen at: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.activesphere.com&#x2F;hacks.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.activesphere.com&#x2F;hacks.html</a><p>If you&#x27;re interested in applying, please try your hand at the problem linked below and reach out to us at career[at]activesphere.com<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;ciju&#x2F;c321a972ab22656e5988\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;ciju&#x2F;c321a972ab22656e5988</a><p>If you solve the problem, we might have a few (probably 2 or 3) rounds of informal interview.","time":1480614916,"type":"comment"}
