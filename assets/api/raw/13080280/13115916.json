Though our first product is focused on agriculture, our aim is to tackle tough, meaningful, global problems with science.  To do this, we&#x27;ve amassed over 3PB of geospatial data, growing at over 10TB per day, and can spin up tens of thousand of cores to perform calculations.  We&#x27;re looking for engineers who want to evolve our platform and for scientists who want to build solutions on top of that platform.
