Our fullstack position is frontend heavy, so it&#x27;s also perfect for someone who is UI&#x2F;UX-oriented but also wants to become better rounded. We are lovers of linux and tmux and vim, and it would be cool if you were too! Alternatively, if you&#x27;re traditionally backend but want to see if the frontend is as cool as people say, this is a good chance to explore that!<p>You&#x27;ll fit in perfectly to our team if:<p>- You not only love coding, but also take the time to reflect on the benefits and drawbacks of your tools, be they frameworks, languages, or processes.<p>- You strive for clean code, but also know how to make your &quot;shortcuts&quot; easy to delete in a crunch.<p>- You know what to test, why to test it, and how to write flexible tests that won&#x27;t break with minor changes.<p>- You&#x27;re comfortable with Linux and know how to get things done on the command line, including on remote servers.<p>- You have experience with or interest in Functional Programming techniques.<p>- You&#x27;re not afraid to use Google or ask for help when something is beyond your grasp.<p>- You care about user interaction, usability, and of course â€“ making the interface beautiful.<p>- In general, technology excites you and you strive to learn something on a daily basis!<p>I put a lot of effort into writing a comprehensive job ad that should give you a good idea of what we offer, and what we want to see in you, and what you would ACTUALLY be doing while working here. Please have a look and get in touch!<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sumup.workable.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;373611\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sumup.workable.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;373611</a>","time":1480611752,"type":"comment"}
