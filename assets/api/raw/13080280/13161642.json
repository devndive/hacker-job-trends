Launched last fall, 7 person core team, venture-backed, growing quickly. (Here’s the app: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;meditation-for-fidgety-skept..\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;meditation-for-fidgety-skept...</a>. )<p>In a nutshell, we&#x27;re looking for a senior developer who is: \n* Excited help us accelerate our growth (we’ve already hit product&#x2F;market fit and things are going fast, but there are big opportunities to make it go faster) \n* Interested in working on a high-visibility product (we’ve been in NYTimes, Good Morning America, and more) that has a big impact on people’s lives (see our reviews on the App Store) \n* Willing to work up and down the stack &#x2F; doesn&#x27;t want to get pigeon-holed on one project. Backend, iOS, analytics, (soon) Android, mobile&#x2F;web, building a team, mentoring, refining development process, etc... You won&#x27;t get bored.<p>The product (for now) is our iOS app. It’s built in Swift &amp; ReactiveCocoa. Our web-back end is Ruby on Rails and Postgres, all living atop Heroku. If you’re interested in functional programming &amp; clean, readable code, we think you’ll like what you see - but we’d prefer it if you helped us make it better still.<p>The interview process involves (i) a 30min call, (ii) a 2hr technical interview, and (iii) a 2hr culture interview (followed by reference checks and conversations to answer any questions you have).<p>Email me derek@ (10percenthappier.com) if you’re interested.","time":1481574738,"type":"comment"}
