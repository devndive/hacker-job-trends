Our mission is to re-imagine the way the world reads!<p>My team is looking for smart engineers to work on <i>recommendations</i>, <i>search</i>, and <i>payments</i> (no experience in these areas required). We are a small team which means you can have a ton of impact and bring in your own ideas. We work on an ambitious project to organize all the books in the world and use it to take book discovery to the next level.<p>Scribd has a very friendly, engineering-driven company culture, is profitable, and well funded. We are ambitious but at the same time we value a good work life balance.<p>Stack: Ruby on Rails (we are one of the largest Rails sites), Go, MySQL, Redis, Kafka, Spark (Scala). But we care way more about your personality and hacking skills than what languages you&#x27;ve used so far.<p>Scribd alumni have gone on to found 4 other YC companies, probably more than from any other startup our size. We think this says something about the kind of people that we like to hire.<p>If you have questions you can reach me at adrian at scribd.com (I&#x27;m the tech lead and happy to answer any question related to this role).
