Our vision is to help individual developers get to the market quickly and become successful.<p><i>Why</i>: I used to struggle building &amp; running a SaaS business. I&#x27;ve gained a good insight to what works &amp; what doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s a never ending learning process and I want to share that passion and knowledge with people like me.<p><i>How</i>: Removing all the pain points around non-product components such as billing, design&#x2F;content changes. Supporting SaaS founders in anyway we can to make them more money.<p><i>Who</i>: I did software development for 4 years and struck out on my own to launch a data harvesting SaaS with paying customers. I&#x27;ve transitioned out of that starting last year and have been pursuing new ideas since then and Saasful was born out of that process.<p><i>Where</i>: Vancouver, BC. It&#x27;d be great if we could grab coffee in downtown but chatting over skype is fine too, hence REMOTE.<p><i>Needs</i>: Somebody to work with me to eventually own the product side and lead the remote development team. More importantly, someone who can also function as a co-founder, an equal partner with a common vision.<p><i>Contact</i>: Please let me know your thoughts by emailing <i>hi@saasful</i> and let&#x27;s figure out next steps together.<p>Thank you for reading!","time":1480621189,"type":"comment"}
