We&#x27;ve built an iOS app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.<p>We&#x27;ve raised $7M, and we&#x27;re looking to bring on a couple more talented engineers.
