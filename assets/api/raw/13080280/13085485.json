To quickly iterate on the design of these reactors, we run software simulations of them on big computers. We have created a large reactor analysis framework (almost all in Python) that performs physics calculations and automates&#x2F;couples (generally older) FORTRAN physics codes to compute neutron densities, power distributions, temperatures, pressures, chemistry, in-pin and ex-pin fuel mechanical motion, transient performance, economics, etc. and do multiobjective optimization on these.<p>The role we&#x27;re looking for will focus on the framework and related systems, seeking to improve the ease, breadth, rigor, speed, and quality of our nuclear innovation, design, and analysis. Nuclear&#x2F;physics&#x2F;applied math experience is a major plus.<p>Process: Phone interview can lead to a one-day, ~6-hour gauntlet of in-person interviews.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;terrapower.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;careers#op-148518-nuclear-computer-scientist\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;terrapower.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;careers#op-148518-nuclear-comput...</a>","time":1480646016,"type":"comment"}
