We’ve gotten more than $2M in multiple grants from the NIH, and last month closed a $13M series A led by Lux Capital. We’re using imaging experiments to turn human cell experiments into massive amounts of rich biological data so we can find treatments for many diseases as fast as possible.<p>Hiring:<p>* Software engineering: Full-stack Software Engineer - Front-end Software Engineer - Machine Learning Engineer<p>* Data science: Growing fast and looking for great people, but applications are offline this month while we improve hiring infrastructure.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recursionpharma.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recursionpharma.com&#x2F;careers</a> for more details and to apply. Applications go to me (CTO) and our lead engineers.<p>Logistics: Salt Lake City, Utah. Hiking&#x2F;running&#x2F;biking is literally out our back door, and it&#x27;s half an hour to 5 ski resorts. Competitive pay, health insurance, relocation assistance (onsite is required), equity, a top-caliber team, and help make a massively positive impact. Happy to sponsor&#x2F;extend visas, but you need to already be authorized to work in the US--we can’t handle the lottery at this stage.<p>Tech: Data science: python scientific stack (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, bokeh, etc). Software engineering: go, python, angular.js, react, javascript on aws and gce. Deep learning (e.g. convolutional networks) we&#x27;re mainly using the python frameworks (keras, theano, tensorflow, etc).<p>Our team of ~30: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recursionpharma.com&#x2F;team\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recursionpharma.com&#x2F;team</a>","time":1480611781,"type":"comment"}
