MLB Advanced Media (now BAMTech) isn’t just about streaming Baseball – we also manage HBO Now, NHL, Twitter NFL, Fox Sports Go, WWE, and several other content providers. You would be helping a team whose services act as the lynchpin for video playback, handling new challenges of scale and speed in a rapidly growing industry. The company is aggressively expanding to meet increased demand, and you would be getting in on the ground floor of this new opportunity. You would help the team create new designs to meet our scaling demands, help us move to the cloud with exposure to AWS EC2, S3, Dynamo, and Kinesis, and help the team introduce new processes to scale. If you like tinkering with new technologies, have experience with high scale systems, or simply want to gain exposure to new tools, this team is a great fit. You’d be helping the team move towards microservices architecture with an emphasis on non-blocking, highly concurrent programming. Experience with Scala&#x2F;Play&#x2F;Akka is highly preferred, but not a requirement. With strong CS fundamentals and an entrepreneurial attitude, you’d be an asset to our team.<p>Apply here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mlb.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;mlbam&#x2F;?gh_jid=262978\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mlb.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;mlbam&#x2F;?gh_jid=262978</a><p>Feel free to PM me for more information","time":1480610066,"type":"comment"}
