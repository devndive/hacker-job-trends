Governments use our tools to save time and money and publish laws in human-friendly and computer-friendly formats.<p>The founders are two lawyer&#x2F;engineers. Our funding is a mix of donations, grants, and government contracts.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for a meaningful way to contribute to our democracy, you find joy in building the perfect tools for your users, and you like deep and challenging problems in such diverse areas as version control, DSL design, and UI&#x2F;UX, then we would love to have you. To apply, email vchuang@openlawlib.org with &quot;[Your Name] - Software Engineer - HN&quot; as the subject.<p>Experience with C#, .NET Core, and building dev tools like IntelliSense is a big plus. Government lawyers live and breath MS Office, so our tools must integrate seamlessly with their MS-centric workflows.","time":1480616093,"type":"comment"}
