Which they&#x27;re not. Quite the opposite, really. Most positions are for our Bedford, MA headquarters, which is just outside of Boston, MA.<p>We&#x27;re looking for people to do embedded (aka firmware for buzzword compliance), test, and hardcore robotics as well. Those aren&#x27;t the same person, mind you. We&#x27;re also looking for electrical engineers and mechanical engineers.<p>We use mostly C and C++, with some Python along the way as well.<p>You do NOT need any robotics experience - I had none when I joined!<p>Check out our careers site and email me if anything looks interesting:<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irobot.com&#x2F;About-iRobot&#x2F;Careers.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irobot.com&#x2F;About-iRobot&#x2F;Careers.aspx</a><p>Please email me at csvec, the at sign, then the company domain.","time":1480616457,"type":"comment"}
