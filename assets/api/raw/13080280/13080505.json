I&#x27;m parsing the thread, all job offers added here are also available on the map on<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whoishiring.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whoishiring.io</a><p>Please read the below if you are planning to post here and would like to have your offer looking good on the map.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing this since August last year, both parsing the thread and adding this comment here. But this time I would like to only slightly improve one thing: the format.<p>First, I would like to say that I really like that this thread is one of the few places where hard format for jobs isn&#x27;t required. The format change that I&#x27;m asking for is minimal and a lot of people already post their posts in similar or exactly the same format.<p>What Iâ€™d like to ask is for the format of the first line to be like this:<p><pre><code>  1) {company} | {job title} | {locations} | {attrs: REMOTE, INTERNS, VISA, company url}\n  Google | Software Developer | SF | VISA https:&#x2F;&#x2F;google.com\n  DuckDuckGo | Software Developer | Paoli PA | REMOTE, VISA</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>  2) {company} | {job title} | {locations}\n  Google | Site Reliability Engineer | London, Zurich, Sydney\n  Facebook | Web-developer | London, Zurich\n</code></pre>\nI will be using this regex to test the firstline.<p><pre><code>  \\s*(?P&lt;company&gt;[^|]+?)\\s*\\|\\s*(?P&lt;title&gt;[^|]+?)\\s*\\|\\s*(?P&lt;locations&gt;[^|]+?)\\s*(?:\\|\\s*(?P&lt;attrs&gt;.+))?$\n</code></pre>\nYou can test it in Python or here <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;regex101.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;relwQD&#x2F;3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;regex101.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;relwQD&#x2F;3</a> (for match look right). What if you do not comply? Absolutely nothing. I will continue to do my best to parse your job post as it is.<p>To HN moderators. Apologies for highjacking the thread. I&#x27;m getting really positive feedback about what I&#x27;m doing here. I just want to improve this one thing.<p>Feedback welcome.","time":1480609207,"type":"comment"}
