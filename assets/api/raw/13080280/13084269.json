[1] There are three attributes you need to select for to identify performing employees in intellectual fields.<p><pre><code>  - General mental ability (Are they generally smart)\n    Use WAIS or if there are artifacts of GMA(Complex work they&#x27;ve done themselves) available use them as proxies. \n    Using IQ is effectively illegal[2] in the US, so you&#x27;ll have to find a test that acts as a good proxy.\n\n\n  - Work sample test. NOT HAZING! As close as possible to the actual work they&#x27;d be doing. Try to make it apples-to-apples comparison across candidates. Also, try and make accomidations for candidates not knowing your company shibboleth.\n\n\n  - Integrity. The first two won&#x27;t matter if you hire dishonest people or politicians.\n     There are existing tests available for this, you can purchase for &lt; $50 per use.\n\n</code></pre>\nThis alone will get you &gt; 65% hit rate [1], and can be done inside of three hours.\nThere&#x27;s no need for day long (or multi-day) gladiator style gauntlets. Apply this process to EVERYONE, including that elite cool kid. You don&#x27;t want to exclude part of your sample population!<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mavweb.mnsu.edu&#x2F;howard&#x2F;Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%20Validity%20and%20Utility%20Psychological%20Bulletin.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mavweb.mnsu.edu&#x2F;howard&#x2F;Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%...</a><p>[2] Technically IQ tests aren&#x27;t &quot;illegal&quot;, but the bar courts have decided companies have to climb is so high it effectively means they are.
