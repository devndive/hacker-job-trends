We help organizations make better decisions through modeling, optimization and data visualization. Our mission is to bring the benefits of prescriptive analytics (optimization) to business and society. To achieve our mission, we foster self-enablement â€“ the ability for organizations to take full control of their analytics strategy and execution.<p>As Front End Software Engineer you will work on our next generation web application development platform which enables our customers to build their own optimization solutions in the cloud. We develop software with which our users develop end-user applications to employ mathematical optimization; a combination of a bespoke programming language, an IDE that includes tools to build UIs and a deployment environment.<p>To be able to do so, you need strong JavaScript knowledge and HTML5 and CSS skills. We&#x27;re looking for a team member with initiative, drive and never-ending curiosity.<p>Please contact Pauline Nobel from HR at Pauline.Nobel@AIMMS.com","time":1536047711,"type":"comment"}
