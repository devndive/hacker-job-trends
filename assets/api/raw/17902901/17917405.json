We believe that information security is too important to be left in the hands of specialists only, and that we need to get more competencies working together to help secure the digital society of today and tomorrow. Unlike many startups, we are financing our own software development through consulting in information security and architecture, which leaves us with much freedom to choose our own direction. We work in an agile fashion, but are mature enough to stay away from the no-planning chaos.<p>We are currently looking for IT- or Solution Architects with an interest to grow in to the field of InfoSec, or InfoSec specialists willing to dabble with Architecture questions such as information- and process modelling. You will become an integral part of our consulting team and push the envelope of our tool ESM - Enterprise Security Modeller.<p>About you:<p>You are a self-driven team-player striving for both personal and collective progress. While you enjoy wandering between the borderless realm of imagination and tinkering with abstract mathematical concepts, you are well grounded with your both feet. You value input, feedback and consider listening to others ideas as important as communicating your own. You approach people inclusively and believe in diversity.<p>If you are the person we are looking for please drop us a line here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.innovatesecurity.se&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.innovatesecurity.se&#x2F;jobs</a>","time":1536151883,"type":"comment"}
