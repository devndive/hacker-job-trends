We have an open and democratic work culture where everyone can contribute, learn and teach. Some highlights are:\n- A fortnightly Investment day &#x2F; training day, modelled on those at thoughtbot and Happy Bear Software.\n- We are all full-stack: We each have our strengths and weaknesses, but as a team of full-stack engineers we find we can work faster and more flexibly, and solving the most important problems first, and solving them more effectively.<p>The company:\nAt BridgeU weâ€™re working to update the university application process with modern technology. We use data science and machine learning to recommend best-fit universities and courses for students from over 100,000 options, based on their academic, professional and social preferences. We build collaborative tools to make it easier than ever to apply and study abroad or at home, both for students and for their school teachers and staff.<p>More information: check out bit.ly&#x2F;lrug-bridgeu-software-engineer","time":1536001828,"type":"comment"}
