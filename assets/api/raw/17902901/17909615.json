These trials protect consumers from ineffective and dangerous products, but the clinical trial process also presents a tremendous bottleneck in delivering life-saving treatments to patients.<p>A typical trial involves coordinating between numerous parties and data formats to gather, store, analyse, and audit clinical data. Mistakes and delays are common, and fewer than 10% of trials finish on time. At Trialspark, we are reimagining the clinical trial process from first principles, and building the technology platform for the trial of the future.<p>So far, we’ve worked with treatments for Ebola, Depression, and HIV. Our reach is growing rapidly, and building a world class engineering team is core to achieving our mission.<p>You will be responsible for products that make a difference for patients and physicians across the country. You&#x27;ll have a strong voice in our organization and product direction. You&#x27;ll work with a team that puts the patient first, and the best solution ahead of the the existing one.<p>Some of the projects we’re working on:<p>+ A state-of-the-art clinical data capture platform to power end-to-end trials\n+ Growth tools to support and guide our trial site expansion\n+ Medical Protocol data ingestion and management tool to support a growing number of trials\n+ Mobile and web applications that provide a seamless clinical trial experience for our patients","time":1536074362,"type":"comment"}
