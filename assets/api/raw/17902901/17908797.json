Our R&amp;D team has numerous contracts to develop and deliver in-space navigation and in-space computing software and hardware to help spacecraft land on the Moon and other planetary bodies  We need multiple talented robotics&#x2F;software engineers to support and take leading positions in the development of our technology portfolio.  Weâ€™ll be developing novel sensors and flying them in-space within a few years.<p>Our R&amp;D team operates autonomously and collaboratively.  We hope that new researchers will be eager learners with ambitions to master their field in a short period of time by challenging themselves and aiming high.
