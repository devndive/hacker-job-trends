We use software to find people that lack opportunity but have great talent and ambition. We give them small grants to support their work and try to use various gamification techniques to keep them motivated on their project. Our goal is to be counterfactually significant in the creation of the next Albert Einstein, Marie Curie or Elon Musk.<p>In the short term our technical challenges are equal parts computer science and human psychology. How do you build a product that can identify greatness? How do you then motivate people to become the best version of themselves? If you were building the Harvard campus, but entirely online, could you make it work?<p>It requires great intuition and solid engineering. We work in Python, Ruby and Javascript.<p>Email us at jobs+hn@pioneer.app. Thanks!","time":1535994905,"type":"comment"}
