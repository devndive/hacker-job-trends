That might seem boring, but the U.S. financial system accounts for more than $1 trillion of GDP, and today&#x27;s banks still run their businesses on mainframe software from the 1980s. That means everything they do is slow and expensiveâ€”and the user experience is archaic.<p>Our team has been working on this problem for over 5 years now. We&#x27;re the team behind Standard Treasury (YC S13) and the Silicon Valley Bank API Platform (the banking backend for Stripe Atlas). Join us and help build a new, modern infrastructure that will massively improve how we all interact with our financial system.<p>Learn more about who we are, our engineering culture, and whether we&#x27;re a good fit for you:<p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;treasuryprime.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;treasuryprime.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a><p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keyvalues.com&#x2F;treasury-prime\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keyvalues.com&#x2F;treasury-prime</a><p>Email us:<p>hiring@treasuryprime.com","time":1536021814,"type":"comment"}
