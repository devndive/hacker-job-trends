Previously I was the second employee (engineer) at Airbnb and left to build CaterCow. Come get in on the ground floor of our engineering team as we execute our plan to win the entire group food ordering market.\nIf you&#x27;re a great full stack engineer with wonderful business &amp; design sense, I&#x27;d love to chat. Email me at chris@catercow.com with &quot;HN Who&#x27;s Hiring September 2018&quot; in the subject.<p>Things that make us different: Profitable, infinite runway, 85%+ owned by founders and employees, no VC (we raised less than $200k 5 years ago, but have grown profitably since then), amazing 8 person full time non-technical team (Sales, Ops, Customer &amp; Caterer acquisition, photographers), best in industry unit economics, very strong 5 year history of increasing revenue and profit growth, flexible and experimental view about travel &amp; work.<p>Looking to hire 2 people immediately who think hard work and excellent software are the most powerful tools to dominate markets.<p>The last time we posted in this thread we ended up hiring @tgriesser (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tgriesser\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tgriesser</a>) as Engineer #1 so you’ll be working directly with the two of us. We’re interested in building a team with a wide variety of skills and viewpoints and are open to all sorts of expertise. Right now we would favor engineers with particularly modern front end &#x2F; design &#x2F; UX sensibilities, a strong history of growth hacking, or experience leading multiple successful product features.<p>===<p>Please email me if you&#x27;re interested in the above :)\nchris@catercow.com with subject &quot;HN Who&#x27;s Hiring September 2018&quot;","time":1535992316,"type":"comment"}
