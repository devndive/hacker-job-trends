We make it easy to run an office by connecting office managers to services, including cleaning, maintenance, administration, repairs, and more. We are invested in building good jobs and empowering others - though we run a gig economy platform, all of our operators are full W2 employees with benefits, stock options, PTO, and more.<p>We&#x27;re looking for engineers and engineering managers who are interested in joining our ~24-person team of curious, empathetic, humble, and driven engineers. We&#x27;re also hiring for experienced product managers!<p>Though we&#x27;re mostly using Django, Node, and React on top of AWS, we take a generalist approach to hiring. Weâ€™re looking for smart people who are problem solvers and passionate about their craft - you don&#x27;t already have to be an expert in our stack.<p>I&#x27;m an engineer at MBQ, feel free to email me directly at eseidohl@&lt;our domain&gt; if you have any questions!<p>MBQ In the News: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;28&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;managed-by-qs-good-jobs-gamble.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;28&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;managed-by-qs-go...</a> <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastcompany.com&#x2F;40483870&#x2F;for-managed-by-q-good-jobs-are-paving-a-path-to-profitability\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastcompany.com&#x2F;40483870&#x2F;for-managed-by-q-good-j...</a>","time":1535991870,"type":"comment"}
