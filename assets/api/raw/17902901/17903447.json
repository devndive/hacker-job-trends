We create small stories around grammatical topics, split the sentences of the story into flashcards, and embed grammar into the subtitles of the flashcards. It&#x27;s a really unique experience, and so far the response from the German-learning community has been great.<p>We use React &#x2F; Mobx in the front-end, and Rails as a API server in the backend. I&#x27;m looking for someone to help with adapting our current codebase to React Native, so React Native eperience would be great. Interest in (spoken) languages is a huge plus! :)<p>Remote is totally fine, though Berlin is preferred.<p>Contact me at jeremy@seedlang.com","time":1535992187,"type":"comment"}
