We&#x27;re looking for a first full-time employee to join our team in South Park, San Francisco!<p>Portico’s mission is to enable newsrooms and publishers to optimize revenue. The journalism industry is undergoing a rapid transformation. Revenues are declining, newsrooms are shrinking, and the industry is consolidating; but readers haven’t stopped reading — their habits have just changed. Portico is building software and partnering with publishers to change their trajectory and unlock the value they deserve. Our products, <i>Test</i>, <i>Tailor</i>, and <i>Pay</i>, can be implemented with no IT support in many cases and our white glove service augments the tech and analytics capabilities of publishers. Together, our software and service help publishers quickly A&#x2F;B test and iterate (<i>Test</i>), customize different experiences for different readers (<i>Tailor</i>), and accept more payment types frictionlessly (<i>Pay</i>). We’re vehement optimists that believe the news industry can adapt and thrive online with new tools, consulting, and revenue models — and we are building a company that we hope will be instrumental in that journey.<p>Check out our jobs here:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;porticopay.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;porticopay.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a><p>Jobs:<p><pre><code>  - Full-stack Engineer\n  - Part-time Designer\n</code></pre>\nAnd send us an email to careers@porticopay.com.","time":1536007360,"type":"comment"}
