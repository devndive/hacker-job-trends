We aim to determine how genetic variation alters our proteins, biochemical pathways, cells, tissues, physiology, and traits&#x2F;susceptibility to disease.<p>This position involves working with a team of genome analysts to develop software for solving real genetic disease cases. We are looking for friendly people with demonstrated experience in web tech, an eye for design, and genuine interest in learning new things. You should be excited to solve engineering challenges associated with loading, searching, deploying, and visualizing huge genomic datasets stored in the cloud. Technologies we use: React, Redux, Python, Docker, Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, Google Container Engine.<p>In this role, you will receive domain-specific training at a world-class research institute. We are supportive of candidates interested in transitioning to graduate school. Your work will be 100% open source and highly visible in the genomics community. You will shape the way scientists interpret human genetic variation. Your work will directly help thousands of kids&#x2F;families find the root causes of rare genetic disease.<p>Email: msolomon@broadinstitute.org (conversations will be kept confidential).","time":1535989112,"type":"comment"}
