We think leaving a great first impression is a large part of that, so we&#x27;ve created a platform that lets product managers create onboarding experiences for their products—without needing to write any code.<p>Many front-end engineers spend a lot of time doing the same non-domain-specific work at every company: building onboarding tours, modals, and tooltips. Like AWS did with many non-domain-specific backend tasks, we&#x27;re here to take this burden away from the engineers and empower product managers to do it themselves, freeing engineers to work on the hard technical problems they really enjoy.<p>Major companies like Canva, Lyft, and IBM are already using us to create amazing user experiences, and over 30M people have seen experiences built with Appcues this year.<p>Appcues&#x27; web products are built with ES6, React, Redux, Styled Components, and the rest of the modern frontend tech cast.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a great frontend engineer to bring our product and user interface to the next level. You will collaborate directly with our users and our 14 incredibly talented engineers—veterans from companies like HubSpot, PayPal, Bose and the MIT Media Lab—to ship product that solves real problems.<p>Hit me up, apply online, or check out our glassdoor for more information.","time":1536016860,"type":"comment"}
