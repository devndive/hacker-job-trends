We understand that pictures are more than just pixels, so we&#x27;re building a platform that lets creative professionals edit whole collections of photographs in terms of the people, objects, and colors they contain.<p>To build this platform, we need engineers (like you?) who can think deeply about complex systems and empathize with artists, and are also curious, respectful, and creative. We use Typescript, React, WebGL, GraphQL, Postgres, Node, Python, Tensorflow, and Terraform, but it&#x27;s not a big deal if you haven&#x27;t.<p>We&#x27;re seed funded -- backed by great VCs, former Dropbox execs, and AI researchers from Google Brain and Salesforce -- and building out our founding engineering team in SF.<p>If you&#x27;d like to talk, I&#x27;m the CTO and you can drop me an email at matt@facet.ai.","time":1535990661,"type":"comment"}
