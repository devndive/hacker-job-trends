Our goal is to make the threat intelligence process run more smoothly and help organizations share threat data better. Our web app pulls threat information (both our own and via external APIs) into a graph and enables real-time collaboration and sharing of the information on the graph. (If you&#x27;re aware of the tools, think of combining Google Docs with a graph editor like Maltego and mix in some process automation.)<p>What we&#x27;re looking for: We&#x27;re looking for two positions: one a mid&#x2F;advanced front-end developer for the front end of our web-based application; the other a mid&#x2F;advanced back-end developer. The front-end is built with React&#x2F;Microcosm&#x2F;Material&#x2F;Vis.js, and it talks to our backend using a mix of REST and WebSockets. The back-end is built in Python with Django&#x2F;Django Channels. Ideally, the UI person we&#x27;re looking for would be comfortable doing both the React programming side of things as well as the HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;layout work, and the backend person would be comfortable with some Golang&#x2F;command line work. There would also be some design work as we roll out new features to the site and migrate data graph db in the near future.<p>Perks of the job: early round shares, competitive salary, 401k, &amp; healthcare benefits. Also, we work from home a lot and our focus is on getting the work done, not on face time.<p>A bit about us: We are a pre-A-round startup. We have a working product and paying customers, so we&#x27;re in a good spot financially. We are based in Alexandria, VA but as mentioned above, working from home is common. We tend to meet up in Alexandria once a week.<p>We encourage all who are interested to contact us. You can reach me at: aaron@kingandunion.com","time":1536002996,"type":"comment"}
