We are developers, designers, and product managers who know how to work fast and deliver together. We understand that products evolve iteratively and know how to take advantage of that fact to maximize useful feedback during the product lifecycle.<p>Carbon Five hires smart people who work well with others and care more about doing fantastic work than getting all of the credit. Egos are checked at the door. Teams are expected to solve problems and given the support to do so without micro-management. It&#x27;s a requirement because every project is different and only a dynamic team can deliver the quality and productivity that goes along with the name.<p>Employees work sane hours because we value the work&#x2F;life balance. We focus on delivering the right stuff rather than the most: less but better. You don&#x27;t have to worry about defending your nights and weekends, they&#x27;re yours. We want everyone to come in fresh and enthusiastic, ready to build good products with a clear mind.<p>If working someplace where delivering quality isn&#x27;t up for debate and you like the idea of working on new things every 4-6 months, Carbon Five might be the right place for you.
