A Spring day is chased away by storms or a late Winter blast. Reese&#x27;s Eggs are back on the shelves, but why do they bother taking them down? Daylight reemerges when you leave work for like... twenty minutes. There is only one thing certain in this time of chaos: NCC Group is constantly hiring security consultants from ALL backgrounds to join our team.<p>If you’re a tinkerer, you enjoy breaking more than building, or someone who wonders “why” and ends up down the rabbit hole 36 hours later with a disassembled air conditioning unit surrounding them... we’d love to hear from you! Our process welcomes those with years of experience, as well as those with little to no direct experience in what we do.<p>The bottom line: if you love security and research, NCC Group just may be a perfect fit for you.<p>What do we do exactly? Penetration testing, security analysis, and cutting-edge research into current technologies and attacks (breaking things). You spend most of your day thinking about security systems and how they can break. You get to be creative and have a lot of freedom to be clever while learning new technologies at a very fast pace. Engagements are usually 2-4 weeks long and in a year you will be exposed to 15-20 products and technology stacks. Your work will typically initiate person-months of security improvements in products millions of people use. You will have access to senior engineers&#x2F;architects and your findings&#x2F;ideas will be heard by senior decision makers. You will have enormous impact in making the software people use safer.<p>All of our consultants are also security researchers, with dedicated research time. Not too shabby!<p>If you want to learn more about us check out our:<p>Blog - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nccgroup.trust&#x2F;us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nccgroup.trust&#x2F;us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;</a>\nCryptopals - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptopals.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptopals.com&#x2F;</a>\nMicrocorruption - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;microcorruption.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;microcorruption.com&#x2F;</a><p>If you&#x27;re ready to apply, contact us at: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nccgroup.trust&#x2F;us&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nccgroup.trust&#x2F;us&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a>.<p>We also have numerous infosec architecture and policy positions available, should your interests and background align: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nccgroup.trust&#x2F;us&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;careers&#x2F;risk-management-governance&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nccgroup.trust&#x2F;us&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;careers&#x2F;risk-manageme...</a><p>We also have many positions in the UK and beyond!
