Our goal is to be how you do science on the internet.<p>We&#x27;re a small team that&#x27;s fiercely mission-driven and very user focused. For example, our team frequently goes on dinosaur digs, tree-climbing survey expeditions, and early morning bird-banding trips with our users, because our users are scientists.<p>Our stack is a mix of rails, react, and sass. Our engineering approach is focused on automation and scale - building platform tools for the community to support themselves.<p>The code you write will directly affect a community of scientists making real discoveries (like this, published this week and funded on Experiment: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;10.1186&#x2F;s40798-016-0044-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;10.1186...</a>).
