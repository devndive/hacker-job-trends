Why Point B is so enticing in the first place is something we have yet to figure out.<p>This should sound both exciting and terrifying at the same time.<p>In practical terms, this means that you should feel that writing tests before writing code is The Right Way To Do Things. You should have strong opinions on technical issues, but also be able to work productively with the team even if they disagree with those opinions. And you should be excited at the idea of working in a balanced team, not just with other software engineers, but also with designers, marketers, and people of the sales persuasion.<p>You will also need to be comfortable tackling hard problems that you only loosely understand, and be willing to treat every line of code that you write as part of a massive science project -- which means that you might have to throw that code away if the experiment doesn&#x27;t pan out.<p>I&#x27;m not going to lie: this is challenging work. But not a challenging work envrionment.<p>We support each other as a team. If you need something -- a book, a tool, a training course -- we will make that happen. We focus on Doing What Works, rather than Doing What Is Least Likely To Get Us In Trouble. And perhaps most importantly, we work at a sustainable pace. At the end of the day, we go home for dinner with our families and time with our friends.<p>If this sounds interesting to you, then let&#x27;s chat.<p>don.werve@skyscanner.jp","time":1456879904,"type":"comment"}
