The exact roles may get tweaked a little:<p>Product Manager of Developer Experience\nEncourage people solving problems with the open source tools built on top of our platform. That involves 3 main responsibilities:\n- Own &amp; evangelize our developer docs\n- Talk to our customers and understand what they’ve built internally\n- Hire freelancers to build tutorials and basic OSS apps\nIdeal background: an OSS developer who has managed freelancers before, who has a public profile and a passion for shipping.<p>Product Manager of API\nBuild the extension points for customers and partners to extend what our app can do natively.  A big part of this involves building exciting new kinds of integrations.\nIdeal background: an experienced PM with the ability to code, ideally who has owned an API before.<p>I haven’t started hiring yet, but if you know of any amazing candidates for either role, send me their URLs dave@pagerduty.com","time":1456865448,"type":"comment"}
