IoT, embedded systems, big data, you name it! We also have some opportunities in iOS and Android if you&#x27;re interested in working on those too. (That is, you must have Go experience, we are not looking for iOS-only or Android-only devs). We&#x27;re a lot like the seed-stage startups we work with because there&#x27;s a big variety to the projects you get to work on.<p>I don&#x27;t care about your experience or resume, I only care if you can code, communicate, and work well with others. If you&#x27;re reading this, put the string DrPepper into your email. You should definitely have good attention to detail, and be self-motivated.<p>If you want to work on Go, and live in a low cost of living area, relocation may be possible after a trial period. But remote is great too (we actually don&#x27;t even have an office right now).<p>Email jobs at stridatum.com with a Go code sample&#x2F;github profile for more info.","time":1456845207,"type":"comment"}
