We&#x27;re building the subscription management platform. You may have seen us on HN a couple of weeks back. This is a great opportunity to make a big impact at the company.<p>We&#x27;re looking for front-end, full-stack, and back-end. If back-end, it&#x27;d be great if you could wear multiple hats for now, including assisting with DBA-like and ops-like duties. Experience scaling large-scale webapps&#x2F;services is a huge plus.<p>Stack: React, Relay, Node.JS, Postgres.  Open to other stacks for back-end, as most of the back-end is in event-driven background jobs.<p>If you&#x27;re smart and love solving problems, email me: jobs+hn@truebill.com","time":1456845049,"type":"comment"}
