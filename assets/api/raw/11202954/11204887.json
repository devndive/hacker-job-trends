We provide many large apparel brands with intuitive and efficient sales workflows, enabling sales representatives to place bulk orders for brick and mortar stores (i.e. how O’Neill ends up in Tilly’s or how Armada ends up on Backcountry). Our stack includes JavaScript (ES6), TypeScript, C#, ASP.NET, SQL Server, memcached, MongoDB, React.js, and Redux.<p>We are looking for talented engineers who have strong skills in application-level TypeScript&#x2F;JavaScript. This includes engineers with experience applying design patterns to their code (Module, Sandbox, etc.), implementing modularization, writing unit tests, and optimizing performance.<p>We think it’s especially awesome if you have experience with modern JavaScript libraries, such as Backbone.js, React.js, Angular.js, Ember.js, Polymer.js, etc. You will work in a highly collaborative, cross-functional, and Agile team and may take a lead role on various software components.<p>We’re also big on fun. It’s not uncommon to spontaneously jump into a table tennis match. Plus, every Friday we eat and drink together.<p>Please email hn@repspark.com with applications or questions. We&#x27;d love to hear from you!","time":1456857180,"type":"comment"}
