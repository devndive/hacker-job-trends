Buffalo, NY<p>ONSITE<p>Visa: transfers and sponsorships<p>Roles: Full-Stack Software Engineers<p>About the company: Zappos.com is an online retailer specializing in shoes and clothing. We&#x27;ve been around since 1999 and were purchased by Amazon appr. 5 Years ago. We have been recognized as a cultural leader and have recently moved to a self-organized model using the governance system called Holacracy.<p>The directive each new software engineer gets is &quot;It&#x27;s your responsibility to figure out what the best use of your time is for the purpose of the company&quot; and then people pitch them for teams and projects. It feels like it&#x27;s startup impact with the resources of Amazon behind you.<p>If this new style of working appeals to you, or even if you just have questions, feel free to shoot me an email at bkirkby@zappos.com<p>Thanks,\n-bk","time":1456853265,"type":"comment"}
