Rockstars need not apply; session musicians only.<p>We hired a Rails engineer who gives frequent talks on diversity issues in tech.<p>We hired a stand-up comedian and mathematician who has been blowing out our UIs with React + Flux.<p>We’re migrating our deployment automation from Elastic Beanstalk + Opsworks to Ansible.<p>We do stuff.<p>Because of the stage of the company we unfortunately cannot consider candidates with minimal experience (e.g. recent dev bootcamp graduates). We need people that have professional experience working as an engineer. We are also only looking to make an in-house, full-time hire here in San Francisco and cannot support part-time, remote, or contract work at this time.<p>Email jobs@truelinkfinancial.com and we&#x27;ll get back to you within 2 business days.
