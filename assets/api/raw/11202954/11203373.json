Strong, fluent command of English language - written and verbal - is required.<p>You should have extensive experience automating, monitoring, and scaling applications on an AWS workload. You should be an expert at infrastructure automation (Ansible preferred, but we also do Chef, Puppet, Salt, etc.) and know the AWS API inside and out.<p>You&#x27;ve done work from home before (it&#x27;s not for everyone) and have a quiet, professional office space you work out of (in your house, some coworking space, etc.). You are comfortable leading client engagements and are fearless in telling them when they&#x27;re trying to get you to do the wrong thing. You thrive when working with limited day-to-day oversight and feedback from either the client or RO management, and are mature enough to proactively reach out for help when you need it.","time":1456847247,"type":"comment"}
