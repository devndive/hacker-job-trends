We&#x27;re starting with income volatility, a huge and largely hidden problem.<p>As our economy trends towards flexible labor, millions and millions of Americans are suffering from tremendously painful income volatility. With Even, these workers can get a steady paycheck, every week, with the job they already have. In good weeks, we automatically set money aside. And in bad weeks, we give our customers credit with no interest.<p>It&#x27;s expensive to be poor. We&#x27;re fixing that, and we need your help.<p>We&#x27;re looking for thoughtful full-stack engineers. Email evan@teameven.com if you&#x27;re interested.","time":1456858122,"type":"comment"}
