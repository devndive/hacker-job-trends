The business is Women&#x27;s (now Men&#x27;s too) Fashion e-commerce &#x2F; subscription service, every few weeks, chosen by personal stylists and our algorithms. The personal stylists choose the perfect outfit for our customers, and the customers love it. Our referral to friend statistic is pretty great, and its a big part of our &quot;growth engine&quot; (Lean Startup term).<p>We do not have formal Product Managers, instead that responsibility is shared between Engineers, UX and the business stakeholder. It works really well, and as an engineer you get a deeper insight into the problems you&#x27;re solving.<p>Its nice for a change to be part of a successful, growing company after working for too many failed startups.<p>I&#x27;m working with some of the smartest, most driven but nicest people and you&#x27;ll be doing yourself a disservice if you don&#x27;t at least consider it. Everyone cares about the craft of Software Engineering. Our interview process is geared towards that, and not towards solving useless puzzles.
