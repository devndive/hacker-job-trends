We’re looking for a developer with good communications skills to help people build awesome things with Anvil.<p>We were on the front page yesterday (&quot;I love this&quot;; &quot;Super cool&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t wait to try it&quot;): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16728706\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16728706</a><p>Our customers range from tiny startups to huge tech companies, and they say similar things. Check out our six-minute demo; I promise you it’s worth it: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anvil.works&#x2F;#about\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anvil.works&#x2F;#about</a><p>You’ll be building example applications, writing tutorials, and helping our users build their apps. You don’t need to be a Python expert already, but you will be pretty soon: most of the code you write will be read by someone working out how to do what you’re doing! Don’t worry - you’ll have the Anvil authors themselves to get you up to speed. Joining a startup this early means you can help shape who we are, as well as who you are in the company. You&#x27;ll also be shaping how everyone uses a shiny new development tool. We’re friendly, open, and have good work-life balance - and we want to stay that way. Come join in!<p>My email is in my profile, or you can drop us a line at recruitment@anvil.works.
