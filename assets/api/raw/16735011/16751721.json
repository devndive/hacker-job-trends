You will take ownership, train and grow the data engineering and statistical learning (&quot;data science&quot;) team of the largest e-logistics company in South East Asia.<p>Likely useful experience:<p><pre><code>  - Software development (aside from building actual software, you&#x27;ll need to read a lot of code to understand systems whose logic is not at database level).\n\n  - A mathematical bend, including awareness of and respect for the ideas behind the relational model (&quot;predicate logic on sets&quot;) as defined by Edgar Codd and Chris Date, and rich data types. If you see a foreign key as a mathematical domain and think in terms of relation values and variables, we are probably on the same page.\n\n  - Knowing your way around PostgreSQL, or failing that any large scale RDBMS deployment; there are infrastructure teams and DBAs but they need your guidance.\n\n  - At least some enjoyment of the resolution of large, complex problems using more abstract methods as opposed to quick hacks and duct tape. \n\n  - UNIX&#x2F;Linux, but if you&#x27;ve read that far you probably have more than enough experience.\n\n  - Speaking Chinese (Mandarin) may help a bit but the team has multiple native speakers.\n</code></pre>\nInterview process:<p><pre><code>  - Email vanessa.tan@lazada.com to be sent a few quick questions. Include &quot;6h9mYszLTq2Y&quot; in the subject line so we know you&#x27;re not a bot.\n\n  - An hour or two over Skype for probing your technical experience.\n\n  - An hour or two in Singapore (if you are there) or over Skype for the C-levels to figure out if they can work with you.</code></pre>","time":1522813462,"type":"comment"}
