We are on a mission to bridge the gap between the expectations of a connected, data-driven workplace and an increasingly disengaged and disconnected workforce.<p>We created our internal operating system called Genome, to achieve the type of workplace that well equips their employees with interconnected-ness to their co-workers and fosters conversations about data and progress in your own role. Our system became such a strong part of our culture, that other companies were interested buying Genome as a product!<p>With the growth of Genome internally within Klick and continued success we have had with Genome for our customers, we need strong .NET Developers who are able to get involved in making back end architecture decisions, selection of libraries, build optimisations, etc. We work in a Microsoft environment so we need people who are very strong in ASP.NET C# MVC &amp; SQL Server.<p>Here is our job description  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;join.senseilabs.com&#x2F;?r=1&amp;l=1&#x2F;#&#x2F;apply-now&#x2F;234\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;join.senseilabs.com&#x2F;?r=1&amp;l=1&#x2F;#&#x2F;apply-now&#x2F;234</a><p>Please reach out to me (adoopan@klick.com) or apply within the link above.<p>Thanks, \nAlyssa","time":1522957340,"type":"comment"}
