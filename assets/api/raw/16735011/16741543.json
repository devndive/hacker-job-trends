If you&#x27;ve seen a commercial where someone takes out their phone and opens an app after a car accident, they&#x27;re probably one of our clients. Many of our clients are fortune 500 companies, but we&#x27;re still relatively small with around 300 employees, half of which work at our office in downtown Chicago.<p>In 2018, our goal is to build new products and make our existing products better. To do that, we need engineers of all backgrounds and experience levels to join our team.<p>Our core stack is React+Rails hosted on AWS&#x2F;Heroku, but there are other projects in various languages. Our primary product is an internal CRM, which is supported by tools we&#x27;ve created for body shops or car rental services and of course our mobile apps.<p>Worth highlighting: We have bi-weekly hack days, where we actually produce new products - nothing is left sitting on a local branch gathering dust. We have good benefits&#x2F;pay, unlimited PTO, and a team of smart people that genuinely enjoy each other.<p>For more information email me directly robert.goetz@snapsheet.me.
