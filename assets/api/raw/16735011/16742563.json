We are gradually migrating the site to Angular 5 SPA on top of FHIR compliant REST API. We develop using Docker, Java, Java EE, Spring, Angular; deploy to Docker Swam clusters; store data in Postgres; integrate using HL7, FHIR, ZeroMQ, Kafka; monitor with Prometheus, Grafana and PagerDuty.<p>Remote, but only from EEA please due timezone and travel issues.<p>Further information and application form: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.patientsknowbest.com&#x2F;careers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.patientsknowbest.com&#x2F;careers.html</a><p>While we are primarily looking for a front-end focused dev at the moment, drop me a line if you are an outstanding Java developer who would be interested to work in the challenging domain of healthcare and you also have lots of experience in navigating and materially improving complex code and systems under the usual pressure of a start-up. (You can reach me a mate [at] patientsknowbest [dot] com)<p>Note: I got some CVs earlier during the month that I haven&#x27;t replied to -- those are still being processed and haven&#x27;t been forgotten :)","time":1522740595,"type":"comment"}
