The company is currently based in Paris and employs 7 persons. ProcessOut is on a mission to help online merchants monitor and optimize their payment performance. Using our payment monitoring &amp; smart routing systems, online merchants optimize payment fees and decrease failed transactions. We’ve already seen billions of dollars go through our platform since launch just last year, and we are still growing strongly.<p>We’re looking for a fearless individual to join our infrastructure team. We’d like to see production experience with the cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure), orchestration systems (ideally Kubernetes), declarative cloud configuration (we love Terraform!). We have a lot of interesting scaling and reliability problems to solve (we are processing millions of high-value requests every day).<p>Email me at louis-paul@processout.com.","time":1522761695,"type":"comment"}
