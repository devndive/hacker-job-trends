We currently have clients in South Africa, Singapore and Ireland. We aim to delight customers with how simple we make payroll.<p>The role will be mostly back-end focused, with PostgreSQL as database. But some front-end skills will be a plus. Web development outside of Rails is also welcome, as long as you&#x27;re happy to convert.<p>The most important part of the interview is an object oriented design exercise, which is also a test of problem-solving skills.<p>Visas: We can&#x27;t point you in the right direction for getting a visa. You&#x27;ll need 2 years of experience if you have a related qualification and more if you don&#x27;t. The visa process does take at least 3 months, however.<p>Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za if you&#x27;re interested, putting &quot;Hacker News&quot; in the subject line.","time":1522795328,"type":"comment"}
