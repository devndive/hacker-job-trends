We were profitable last year are projected to explode in growth 2018. Looking for talented senior engineers to help keep up with demand. Email me if you&#x27;re interested: fahim@adquick.com<p>About AdQuick<p>* Founded by ex-Instacart engineers&#x2F;marketing \n* Raised $3M led by Initialized Capital (Garry Tan &amp; Alexis Ohanian, Reddit co-founder). \n* Our customers include great brands such as: Kevin Hart, Peloton, FanDuel, Drake, Lyft &amp; more.<p>Technical Stack<p>* Our tech stack is Rails 4, Webpack, React, Postgres, Heroku. \n* Looking for 3+ years experience in running production systems, ability to iterate quickly and sense of ownership. \n* Strong focus on user experience and putting the customer first.<p>Technical Challenges<p>* We have a complex frontend user interface. Users should be able to view 100,000+ markers and transit lines on a map without their browser crawling to a halt. We need to support complex and interesting map visualizations â€“ layering political voting data, Census data, Foursquare data and more.<p>* We&#x27;re a search company. AdQuick conducts a search every time the user pans the map. Searching by geography, demographics, AdQuick score and a myriad of other attributes from disparate data sources is computationally expensive. It will be a challenge to scale while keeping search response times and server costs low.<p>* We&#x27;re a data science company. We integrate with Google Analytics &amp; AdWords and other data sources to measure impact of physical advertising on online behavior (CTR in a region). ROI data from prior campaigns can help create more effective future campaigns. As our data warehouse grows, crunching this data will be increasingly challenging and more powerful. We&#x27;ll use machine learning to create better campaigns overtime.<p>* Our backend systems have to deal with a myriad of inventory CSV, PDF formats, requiring robust and fast file validations, normalization and ingestion systems.<p>* We scraped Instagram and used image recognition to see if people shared photos of billboards. Turns out, a lot of people Instagram&#x27;d Drake&#x27;s board. Innovative ROI tools are a core part of our offering.","time":1522695860,"type":"comment"}
