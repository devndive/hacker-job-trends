We’re currently expanding into new markets and new territories, and we’re looking to expand our team!<p>What we look for in a developer:<p>* Haskell ability. You should already be comfortable and productive with Haskell, and ready to dive in and make a difference to a large, evolving codebase.<p>* Communication and teamwork ability. While our HQ is in Singapore, our development team is distributed geographically across four timezones, so we look for someone who will feel happy in this context.<p>Familiarity with the following technologies is not required, but will be an advantage:<p>* ClojureScript.<p>* Amazon Web Services.<p>* Docker.<p>* Nix.<p>As a financial company, we care a lot about the correctness and performance of our code. We aim to use modern Haskell practices wherever we can, both to make our lives easier, and also to make developing the platform as rewarding (and fun) as possible.<p>To apply, please send us an email at hr+hn@capital-match.com with a brief resume and optionally a link to your open source contributions.<p>More about our technical stack: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech-blog.capital-match.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;3-anatomy-of-haskell-web-app.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech-blog.capital-match.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;3-anatomy-of-haske...</a>","time":1522843822,"type":"comment"}
