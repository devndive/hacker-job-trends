Our platform makes it easy to view menus from hundreds of local caterers and restaurants, customize a meal to your team’s dietary restrictions and preferences, and place an order for any occasion.<p>We’re looking for front and backend developers with experience using Heroku, NodeJS, Postgres, Rails, Angular 4 &amp; Typescript, Sass, Github, and Git.<p>Our office is dynamic, supportive, and - if we’re honest - a lot of fun. Here’s a testimony from one of our actual developers:<p>“Coming into work every day is a pleasure. Spending time with coworkers.. I’m really interested in my work… I really couldn’t be more effusive about the quality of the environment… And the fact that I’m able to work on projects that I’m passionate about….”<p>So maybe we aren’t the most articulate - but you get it. If you value working in an intellectually stimulating environment, with lots of opportunities for growth (and free food), this might be the place for you. Our company ethos is focussed around making sure that employees get treated like human beings - so our approach to things like flex time, and encouraging and celebrating each team member’s personal achievements (in and out of the office) reflects that.<p>If you’re interested in learning more about our hiring process, check out the listings here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.platterz.ca&#x2F;c&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.platterz.ca&#x2F;c&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a>.","time":1522685223,"type":"comment"}
