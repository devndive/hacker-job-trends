If you&#x27;ve used Siri, you&#x27;ll probably know that it&#x27;s okay at handling single-sentence commands like &quot;remind me to call Jane in 2 hours&quot;, but anything significantly more complicated - anything that requires a 2-way conversation to establish what you want - is much much more flakey and inconvenient. At PolyAI, we&#x27;re building the first developer platform for making scalable, maintainable voice apps that rely on <i>conversations</i>, rather than just single-commands. This opens up the possibility of Alexa&#x2F;Google Home skills for Deliveroo, Uber, Postmates etc that are actually convenient to use and &quot;just work&quot;.<p>We think this is the first step towards a future where voice interfaces are the de facto way of carrying out small to medium sized tasks.<p>We&#x27;re a small but fast growing team of 8 people, comprised of (really good!) NLP researchers, and software engineers with a bunch of startup experience behind us. We&#x27;re healthily funded by Passion and Amadeus and pay competitively.<p>We&#x27;re looking for:<p>* backend engineers\n* machine learning&#x2F;NLP engineers<p>I just want to point out that while we are currently a team of all men, we are super keen to move away from that, and regularly introspect about whether there&#x27;s anything about our culture that may in any way exclude non male candidates. Additionally, we are always open to feedback about anything we might be getting wrong here.<p>Get in contact at angus@poly-ai.com","time":1522751375,"type":"comment"}
