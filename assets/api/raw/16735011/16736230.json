It seemed silly to us that even though so many companies are struggling to hire people, it still requires O(n) effort to apply to n companies.<p>So, we built <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;workatastartup.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;workatastartup.com</a>. It&#x27;s a simple way to apply to all YC companies at the same time. It&#x27;s only for software engineers &amp; data scientists for now (we hope to open it more broadly later). If a company is interested, you&#x27;ll get an email from them.  We also recently added a directory (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;workatastartup.com&#x2F;directory\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;workatastartup.com&#x2F;directory</a>) where you can browse the jobs of some of the companies hiring through the site and apply directly (not all have finished their profile yet).<p>It seems to be working pretty well - many of the people who posted a profile have gotten more than a dozen company founders reaching out to them, and some people have gotten jobs through it already. That said, it&#x27;s still a bit inconsistent and most likely to have good results if you&#x27;re looking for a full-time role in the US.<p>We&#x27;d love if you filled out a profile and let us know what you think (workatastartup@ycombinator.com) : <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workatastartup.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workatastartup.com</a>","time":1522687400,"type":"comment"}
