We&#x27;re one of Silicon Valley&#x27;s best kept secrets – we manufacture printed circuit boards (PCB’s) for thousands of customers nation-wide, including engineers at some of the world&#x27;s biggest tech companies. We’re building up a team of engineers at our internal startup, dubbed “Factory of the Future”, to completely revolutionize the electronics manufacturing industry.<p>We had an exciting reception to this ad last month, and are looking to bring on additional full-stack and front-end developers to round out our team to work on custom web-apps that enhance and streamline the PCB manufacturing process. You&#x27;ll be involved in developing tools that get orders through production as seamlessly as possible, with the opportunity to drive interesting projects involving automation, data visualization, and machine&#x2F;3rd party integration. These include developing 3rd party integrations for use with popular CAD and CAM packages, optimizing our factory processes to get real-time feedback to and from jobs on the floor, and offering real-time feedback on the manufacturability of a customer’s design the instant design files are uploaded.<p>Our stack is built around React, GraphQL, Python, Django, Postgres.<p>We&#x27;re happy to offer excellent benefits and competitive salaries, flex hours, and the opportunity to work remotely. Our main office is in Hollister, CA, just south of San Jose. Love nature?
