I like the product, I like my team, I like the culture. I never feel like I&#x27;m the smartest guy in the room.<p>Tanium&#x27;s product is basically computer management&#x2F;security for government and large enterprises. What makes it special is that it&#x27;s reliable and fast - customers love us!<p>Lt. Gen. Bill Bender, the former CIO of the US Air Force, said before he retired that Tanium is <i>&quot;game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes.&quot;</i> [1]<p>Tanium is about 650~700 people, profitable, and growing fast. We&#x27;re hiring for all kinds of roles, but I&#x27;ll call out a few interesting ones below.  Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, and self directed&#x2F;unlimited vacation (most folks take 4~5 weeks).<p>--<p>Senior Software Engineer - $120~160k+ - (My role.) The core is mostly C++, and then JavaScript for the modules and admin interface (AngularJS&#x2F;Node.js - we&#x27;ll probably upgrade from AngularJS to something newer eventually, but it works for now). There&#x27;s also small but growing amounts of Rust and Python.<p>Most Product Engineers work on site, but we also consider candidates for US Remote work (pick the closest one) - SF: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;ixfioowp1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;ixfioowp1</a> | RTP: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;bxio4pg51\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;bxio4pg51</a><p>--<p>Associate &amp; Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization within Tanium doesn&#x27;t really have any parallels that I&#x27;m aware of elsewhere. As a TAM, you&#x27;d be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you&#x27;d be primarily responsible for advising maybe 2-5 customers for how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.<p>Remote or on site in one of the following countries: Australia, Canada, France, Japan, or USA.<p>Associate TAM - $80~130k: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;slpflp3j1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;slpflp3j1</a><p>Director TAM - $120~170k+: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;r64ytqkl1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;r64ytqkl1</a> (Note: &quot;Director&quot; is indicative of the responsibility level, but it is not a people-managing role.)<p>--<p>Security Engineer - $120~140k (US Remote): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;oghwvo2u1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;oghwvo2u1</a><p>Product Security Engineer - $120~140k (RTP): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;w007hqa21\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;w007hqa21</a><p>Data Engineer - $120~140k (US Remote): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;qv23wo5e1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;qv23wo5e1</a><p>--<p>Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fedscoop.com&#x2F;air-force-cio-says-role-become-much-prominent-prepares-retire&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fedscoop.com&#x2F;air-force-cio-says-role-become-much...</a>","time":1522681602,"type":"comment"}
