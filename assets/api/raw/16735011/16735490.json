Therefore looking for community managers (experience with chat community management like Telegram or Slack is a nice plus), marketing managers and creatives&#x2F;designers. We are also looking for programmers on Android, and back-end programmers (we use Rust and, for the time being, Solidity for our smart contracts).<p>As a young but properly funded company (raised $25M two months ago), we do test our software, have a flexible vacation policy, very competitive packages including tokens and equity, enough runway for several years, and are potentially open to remote workers for some positions.<p>We believe in fair interview processes so we won&#x27;t ask you to whiteboard your way out of a red black tree, but will make sure you can perform on the task. We also won&#x27;t do more than two rounds of interviews, as we&#x27;re respectful of your time.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in financial inclusion, Rust, blockchain&#x2F;cryptocurrencies, or simply want to write software that helps people send money home efficiently, please email jobs at telco dot in.<p>For back-end positions, some experience with Rust, fraud management, payment processors, or telecom software would be a nice plus, but not necessary.<p>We also welcome (paid) interns.","time":1522683619,"type":"comment"}
