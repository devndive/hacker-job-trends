Our small, dedicated, and compassionate team is looking for an exceptional Android engineer to help us in the quest for ever greater public access to information. Join us in our efforts at the main NYPL branch location (of Ghostbusters fame) and you&#x27;ll experience the pleasure of working full-time on open-source software, enjoy a healthy work-life balance, and sleep well at night knowing you&#x27;re doing what&#x27;s best for the patrons of the library, not someone else&#x27;s bottom line.<p>Our native app is written primarily in Java with new development being undertaken in Kotlin. You should be competent with Git, know a thing or two about SQL, and understand the basics of JavaScript and DOM manipulation. Knowledge of the EPUB format, familiarity with building accessible apps, and a good understanding of functional programming are major plusses. We&#x27;re also very passionate about our institutional values of collaboration and mentoring.<p>Ready to improve the experiences of library patrons around the US?
