We&#x27;re looking specifically for 1-2 more engineers to join our engineering team in Berkeley, where we&#x27;re developing a desktop companion app that uses computer vision, data-driven insights, and expert-crafted content to help gamers make better in-game decisions. Think of it like an &quot;automated friend&quot; that sits next to you that tells you what you need to do to win&#x2F;get better. The games we&#x27;re currently focus on are League of Legends, Overwatch, and CS:GO.<p>The work is a lot of fun but pretty technically challenging. Basically both a concurrency and scaling problem (on the data-driven insights part where we parse and aggregate millions of match data), and also how do you do image processing in real-time without dropping gamers&#x27; FPS significantly.<p>More details on the position here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bltz.gg&#x2F;hiring-backend\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bltz.gg&#x2F;hiring-backend</a><p>If interested, please email jobs@blitzesports.com.","time":1522708705,"type":"comment"}
