We&#x27;re creating protocols to allow buyers and sellers of fractional usage assets and services (think Airbnb, Getaround, Fiverr, Taskrabbit) to transact without paying middlemen 20-30%. We&#x27;re excited by the opportunity to build censorship resistant marketplaces and redistribute value to the contributors to the network instead of just the founders and VCs. We believe the open source protocols we&#x27;re developing could ultimately replace dozens of existing multimillion or multibillion dollar businesses.<p>We&#x27;re experienced founders who have built and sold multiple businesses in the past. Origin is the most ambitious idea we&#x27;ve tackled to date (hopefully on the right side of crazy). We currently have a working MVP built on Ethereum and IPFS. We&#x27;re looking for all sorts of people to join our team, whether you code in react, python or solidity. We&#x27;re a distributed team and open to remote.<p>Ping us at founders@originprotocol.com if you&#x27;re interested.","time":1522707291,"type":"comment"}
