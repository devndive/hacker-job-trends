We&#x27;re moving into a new 6,000 Sq ft office in downtown San Jose, and we&#x27;re expanding our brand new Portland office to another floor after moving in in on January 1.<p>Green Bits provides inventory management, point of sale, and compliance solutions to over 1,000 retail cannabis dispensaries in both medical and recreational markets.<p>We&#x27;ve basically built an iOS App(switching to Android soon here) that&#x27;s composed of a lot of single use apps in a dispensaries workflow. We also have a web application that can handle back office reporting and business analytics on a management level.<p>Core services are built in Rails, and the front end is a combination of EmberJS and Objective-C moving to React and React Native. Everything&#x27;s on AWS (RDS, EC2, S3) and we use Docker and Kubernetes for orchestration.<p>The cannabis industry is growing rapidly (heh), and we&#x27;re positioned to take a lot of the market in the very near future, so it&#x27;s an exciting time to come on board.<p>If this sounds interesting, apply here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;greenbits#.WsKGadPwamk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;greenbits#.WsKGadPwamk</a><p>Applications go right to me.","time":1522697851,"type":"comment"}
