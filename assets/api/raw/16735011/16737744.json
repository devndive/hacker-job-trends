NHS waiting lists are more than 9 months to see a counsellor and private therapy is only really viable if you have the money to spare or are really in need. In short, support is archaic and inaccessible.<p>We set out to build mental health support for how people live today. We offer message chat-based support and allow you to receive ongoing therapy from a counsellor. In a really short space of time, we have built the product and are already supporting thousands of people. We&#x27;ve also just raised our first round of funding and taken on some truly incredibly talented people into the team.<p>We&#x27;re using React Native&#x2F;Redux and are design led as a company. We&#x27;re looking for an engineer who is driven work on a really exceptional product.<p>Please email your CV and a short paragraph on why you&#x27;re interested to calvin@sphereapp.org<p>Thanks!","time":1522694361,"type":"comment"}
