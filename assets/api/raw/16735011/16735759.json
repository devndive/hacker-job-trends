We’re building a platform for fashion designers &amp; brands — our customers design apparel with our tools, and we develop and produce it with our network of manufacturers. We’ve worked with incredible designers and brands, including rapper Wiz Khalifa and streetwear legends 424 and Pleasures.<p>We’re a super small team; you’ll be one of the first engineers and a huge part of growing the product and team. Our tech stack is mostly TypeScript&#x2F;node&#x2F;React&#x2F;Postgres right now, but with some other small things in the mix too. You’ll be working across the whole stack; web, backend services and APIs, iOS and more.<p>Email me at d@ca.la if this sounds like a good fit!","time":1522685050,"type":"comment"}
