We are hiring Senior Full Stack Engineers (Python, React, Elasticsearch), DevOps Engineer, QA Engineer, Backend Engineers (Python, Neo4J, Django), and Software Team Leads.<p>BenchSci is a machine learning startup based in Toronto. We use A.I to decode biomedical papers to help scientists accelerate drug discovery. Each year, biomedical researchers waste over a billion combined hours. The problem is with products they purchase to influence and measure proteins. There are millions of them, from hundreds of vendors. Finding the right products for specific experiments is tough. Researchers spend hours and sometimes days searching through published papers for guidance. But even then, many products they buy don&#x27;t work. Some aren&#x27;t right for a specific experiment. Others are poor quality. This delays scientific discoveries by weeks or months. And it slows availability of breakthrough treatments, while making them more expensive.<p>Apply here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benchsci.bamboohr.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benchsci.bamboohr.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a>","time":1522704170,"type":"comment"}
