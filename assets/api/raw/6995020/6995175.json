It&#x27;s not your standard cycle tracking app - we turn to our good friend Science to make recommendations to women about where they are in their cycle, and what that means to them. They more it&#x27;s used, the more it knows about you, and the more it can help you.<p>We&#x27;ve got a great iOS app, we&#x27;ve got thousands of active users, we have funding, but we need an Android implementation to take us to the next level. That&#x27;s where you step in! You&#x27;ll have plenty of control and freedom to make this a properly native Android app.<p>Interested? Curious?
