H1B okay.<p>AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the foreign exchange markets.<p>We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything, designing and implementing our own trading strategies and infrastructure. We are a very small team (I am the only employee) looking to add one or two engineers who will focus on strategy and&#x2F;or on infrastructure. No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.<p>An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.<p>Learn more at <a href=\"http://amacapital.net/careers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;amacapital.net&#x2F;careers.html</a>, and contact us at careers@amacapital.net.","time":1388594095,"type":"comment"}
