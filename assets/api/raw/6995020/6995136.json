New York, NY<p>We&#x27;re looking for full-time software engineers to help change the beverage alcohol business. Our stack is Rails backed by Postgres with Solr for search.<p>About the company. Ever wonder how bars and restaurants buy their alcohol? SevenFifty is modernizing the wholesale beverage alcohol industry, which is massive but technologically antiquated. We&#x27;re working with leading wholesalers, bars, restaurants, and wine stores across the country. We&#x27;re funded, have revenues, and are on track to being profitable without additional funding.<p>About your role. You’ll be an early member of the engineering team and will tackle a wide range of problems. You’ll get exposure to all aspects of web application development. You&#x27;ll work on hard problems like search and the processing of structured and unstructured datasets. You’ll own user-facing features from conception and design to deployment. You’ll also learn about the wine and spirits industry, which is intellectually rich, occasionally bizarre, and a ton of fun. (If interested, we’ll even help you further your formal education in wine, spirits, or beer.)<p>You can email me directly at steve@sevenfifty.com.","time":1388588870,"type":"comment"}
