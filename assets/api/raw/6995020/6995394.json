We are ramping up to handle a jaw-dropping amount of incoming data. Data storage involves MySQL and other technologies in a fault-tolerant, distributed environment.<p>Operations and System Administration<p>We’re hosted in Amazon AWS and looking for people who do developer and sysops types of work — writing some server software, setting up some machines, whipping up some Ansible code, and so on.<p>Front End Development<p>The web app is backed by a small amount of PHP and Symfony2, and fronted by Angular and D3.js, CSS (Less), and HTML5. There’s a lot of API interaction from JavaScript, and a complex single-page user interface with rich data visualization that’s key for making our customers rave about the experience, not just the technology. We need people who can work in Angular, D3, design, styling, and so forth.","time":1388594085,"type":"comment"}
