We&#x27;ve been in beta for about a year, and are formally calling it 1.0 in a few weeks.  We&#x27;ve got a lot of great traction, and almost universally stellar feedback from our users. We&#x27;ve also recently received a federal grant[1] to help fund our next generation of products (and a round of hires).<p>Everyday we get to deal with a range of problems that few startups get to offer – we have a pretty modern web-stack [2] (that we actually need, not just to be trendy), but also get to solve interesting physics&#x2F;optimization problems on a regular basis, while also acting as industry thought-leaders.  It&#x27;s a really unique place in both the solar industry, and as a software company.<p>We&#x27;ve made it this far as a two-man team, and we&#x27;re poised for a lot of growth in the next year, so it&#x27;s about time we brought on some help.  If you&#x27;re a full-stack engineer looking to do some really interesting work (and occasionally put your undergrad physics courses to real use), we&#x27;d love to hear from you.<p>– Paul<p>paul.gibbs@folsomlabs.com<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/sunshot/incubator_projects.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www1.eere.energy.gov&#x2F;solar&#x2F;sunshot&#x2F;incubator_projects...</a><p>[2] AngularJS (frontend), Python&#x2F;Flask (API&#x2F;Backend), Cython&#x2F;C (Physics Simulation Engine)","time":1388599155,"type":"comment"}
