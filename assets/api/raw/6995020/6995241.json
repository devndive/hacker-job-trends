We&#x27;re also experimenting with new, supplementary ways of content monetisation.<p>What we do is disruptive and controversial, and we&#x27;ve had our share of bad press in the past. Much of it lies, but there&#x27;s also legitimate criticism we need to address. We do this by being as open as we can possibly be, which is what we believe we ought to do anyway. Mozilla is pretty close to what we want Eyeo to be, and we&#x27;ll get there.<p>Drop me a line at felix@adblockplus.org if you&#x27;re up for all this, I&#x27;d love to hear from you. Please include a list of notable open source projects you are contributing to or have contributed to. We&#x27;re an open source project, so that&#x27;d be a big plus.","time":1388591125,"type":"comment"}
