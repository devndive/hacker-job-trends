Our product is built around the OpenStack Swift[1] object storage engine and provides management, monitoring, and integration for the entire storage system.<p>Working at SwiftStack, you&#x27;ll work with new technology[2], participate in open-source community work, and build a storage engine that is used by millions. We&#x27;re solving all kinds of interesting problems, and I&#x27;d love to work with you to solve them. Three things we&#x27;re working on right now are:<p>- building erasure codes into OpenStack Swift[3]<p>- making clean responsive UIs to simply communicate information about large storage clusters<p>- analyzing system metrics to intelligently respond to and predict system behavior<p>Interested in knowing more?
