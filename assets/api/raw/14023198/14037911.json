Prescriptions, if needed, go directly to the pharmacy of choice.<p>We are growing our engineering team on essentially all fronts. Major components of our stack include Python, Django, Postgres, Celery, RabbitMQ, Redis and Ansible.<p>Though not listed on the jobs site as of this writing (working to fix this), we also have a few software engineering internships open.<p>It&#x27;s best to apply through the website for a specific position, but if you don&#x27;t see a position that you feel you would be a good fit for or if you are applying for an internship, contact Jacinda (jshelly@doctorondemand.com).
