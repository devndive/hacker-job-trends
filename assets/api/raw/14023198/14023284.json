We use their existing vendors if they have them and find vendors if they do not. We see this marketplace differently than other companies in this field -- most companies focus on software-only solutions or purely manual coordination, which does not scale. At Latchel we use technology to make our internal operations much more efficient, but develop to the level our customers&#x27; users are comfortable with. After only a two months of operation, we&#x27;re more than 3x more efficient than the industry standard for maintenance coordination. Join our small and growing team and bring technology to the technologically challenged property management space.<p>Our interview process has a small code review exercise followed by behavioral and culture fit interview and lunch or dinner. You can view the code review exercise here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;latchel&#x2F;code-challenge&#x2F;pull&#x2F;6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;latchel&#x2F;code-challenge&#x2F;pull&#x2F;6</a><p>Languages: Angular.js (1.x), PHP (Laravel 5), PostgreSQL<p>Notes: We offer equity and medical, dental, vision and relocation to Seattle.<p>If you&#x27;d like to learn more about the opportunity, problem space, and the team, email me: will@latchel.com<p>Alternatively, you can complete the code review exercise to apply.","time":1491232212,"type":"comment"}
