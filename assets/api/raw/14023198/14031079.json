We help people access the courts and the legal system through crowdfunding. Since launch in May 2015 we have helped important cases raise over £2.5M in funding, seen claimants get their cases to the Supreme Court, given communities a voice – and we’ve been featured in the Guardian, FT, BBC, TechCrunch, NYT and more.<p>We are looking for a developer to join our lean team in central London. This role could suit someone with 1-2 (or more) years’ experience as a developer, who is looking to learn fast by getting their hands dirty at an early-stage fast-growing startup.<p>The CrowdJustice platform backend is written in Python, Django and Postgres, with the front-end in plain Javascript, HTML and SASS – though you don&#x27;t need experience in all of these. You&#x27;ll be working on new features across the stack, e.g. new internal tools for our awesome case support team, optimising our mobile experience or improving integration with our payment provider (Stripe).<p>Interview Process: 20-30 minute phone&#x2F;hangouts chat about the role (no surprise technical questions!); a 1-2 hour technical task that we pay you to complete; a 1.5 hour on-site interview where we&#x27;ll discuss the technical task, pair program some work and talk about your future at CrowdJustice; if successful, a fair offer and the chance to join a well funded startup early on its mission to increase access to justice!<p>Email jobs - at - crowdjustice.org with a CV and&#x2F;or link to your github, linkedin, stackoverflow, twitter, etc.","time":1491301110,"type":"comment"}
