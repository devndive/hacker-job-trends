We&#x27;re building an amazing team, users rave about our product, and things are taking off â€“ we&#x27;re closing seven-figure contracts and revenue grew 5x last year. And we&#x27;re doing it on a sane, 40-hour, daily-team-hike, Fridays-at-home schedule. We&#x27;re pre-series-A, but in many ways playing like a series B company, so this is a chance to get the best of both worlds -- early-stage equity and impact, with later-stage compensation and stability; plus a very strong team for peering or mentorship.<p>Backend Engineer: We&#x27;ve built a NoSQL data engine from scratch that searches text at 750 GB&#x2F;second. How&#x27;d you like to help us scale and optimize to multiple TB&#x2F;second?<p>Frontend Engineer: &quot;The fastest blog in the world&quot; (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jacquesmattheij.com&#x2F;the-fastest-blog-in-the-world\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jacquesmattheij.com&#x2F;the-fastest-blog-in-the-world</a>) loads in under 100 ms. Help us push our data visualization tools toward that goal.<p>Devops Engineer: We run hundreds of servers, process 750 GB&#x2F;second, maintain 99.99% uptime, and almost never get paged (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.scalyr.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;99-99-uptime-9-5-schedule&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.scalyr.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;99-99-uptime-9-5-schedule&#x2F;</a>). But we&#x27;re still not satisfied. How&#x27;d you like to take our operations to the next level as we go through our next 10x of growth?<p>Customer Success Engineer: our customers are engineers. We&#x27;re looking for someone with lightweight ops experience and good communication skills to help them get the most out of Scalyr. A great opportunity to join the team and work your way up the engineering ladder.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scalyr.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;back-end-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scalyr.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;back-end-engineer</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scalyr.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;front-end-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scalyr.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;front-end-engineer</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scalyr.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;devops-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scalyr.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;devops-engineer</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scalyr.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;customer-success-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scalyr.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;customer-success-enginee...</a>","time":1491242230,"type":"comment"}
