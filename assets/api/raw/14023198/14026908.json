I&#x27;m one of the engineers here at Honeycomb. There are 12 of us on the engineering team right now, and we&#x27;re looking to grow!<p>Honeycomb are building a next generation Ad Delivery network for Broadcast and Online publishers. Our platform is enabling faster, cheaper delivery of ads from creative agencies and post houses.<p>Our tech stack is largely Ruby on Rails, though we are breaking out into services and believe in using the right tool for the job (currently we have one service in Node, and another in Go). We use Ansible, Docker, CircleCI and Jenkins to deploy to Linux (and some Windows) on AWS and Azure. We believe in TDD, CI&#x2F;CD, pair programming, and agile practices.<p>We work remote first, though those of us that live in England tend to meet at the London office once a week.<p>Honeycomb is a place of equal opportunity, we believe that the best teams are ones with a diverse background. We are on a journey to make our team “diverse by construction” and welcome applicants from all backgrounds, gender and ethnicity.<p>Would you like to join us? Reach out to me on louis.pilfold@honeycomb.tv :)","time":1491251878,"type":"comment"}
