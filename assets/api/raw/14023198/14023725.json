The student would be responsible for 95% of sensor selection, layout, noise reduction, etc.<p>A mechanical engineering student would design &amp; run experiments to parameterize a lumped capacitance thermal model of a synchronous generator. For example, determining the conduction coefficient of an enamel coating.<p>On a scale of independent researcher (10) and being given a task of lists to accomplish everyday (0) these positions are a 7.<p>If interested, reach out to the e-mail in my profile.","time":1491234620,"type":"comment"}
