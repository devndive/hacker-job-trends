There is a lot of software being created by just a few people, and it&#x27;s possible for you to make a huge impact. The pace is quick, but with lots of individual flexibility.<p>It&#x27;s a very interesting time for us - our latest product is attracting customers faster than we can bring them online.  Most ad tech is not defensible, but our product depends on our in-house video platform and our relationships with content producers. Those producers can finally monetize off-YouTube embeds, and at the same time we&#x27;re bringing significant revenue to web publishers who have built large followings by curating and embedding viral videos.<p>Our tech stack currently includes: JavaScript (Angular, node.js), Python, BigQuery, and Ansible.<p>We are patiently searching for great engineers, particularly full-stack developers.
