Think of it like continuous integration, but for mechanical engineers. We&#x27;re looking for software engineers with interest in computational geometry&#x2F;geometric processing, computational physics&#x2F;engineering, and building beautifully elegant user experiences for complicated technical software.<p>Our stack: * C++ for performance-critical finite element code * Ruby on Rails for server code * React + Three.js + regl on the frontend<p>Our competitive advantage comes from a combination of software architecture innovation and a super accessible user experience, so we need people who value these two pillars of their craft.<p>We&#x27;d love to hear from you!
