Memory-managed languages are best -- .e.g. C#, Java, Python, Ruby, etc. We do most of our work in C#&#x2F;.Net, but specific experience here is not required.<p>Cool stuff about TTD:<p>* Our platform processes 5million+ queries per second<p>* Work with the best engineering team in AdTech<p>* The combination of huge data sets, high throughput, low latency and amazing scale means that we&#x27;re constantly solving some of the biggest challenges in computer science.<p>* We&#x27;ve grown faster than any other adtech company in the industry, and have been recently recognized as one of the fastest growing companies in America by Inc.
