The key technologies we use are Docker, Rancher, and RightScale. We are multi-cloud between public AWS and private VMWare vCenters, and operate many environments from the ground up using infrastructure as code and automation. We help teams build and run their own apps, primarily in Java or NodeJS, but as a team we favour writing our internal tooling using Golang. We’ve migrated existing huge, awkward COTS deployments onto this PaaS as well as helped build greenfield 12-factor apps from the ground up. Ancillary technologies in play are: RedHat’s JBoss and Enterprise Linux; the Netflix OSS stack; Spring Boot; the Elastic Stack; HAProxy; Nginx; Prometheus&#x2F;Grafana; Zipkin; Bamboo; goCD; Ansible.<p>Sorry - no visa or remote opportunities.
