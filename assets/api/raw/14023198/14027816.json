Currently, half of a typical developerâ€™s time is spent finding and fixing bugs; we aim to bring that number as close to zero as possible by automating the entire monitoring process and allowing developers to focus their time on feature development. To do this, we give our users instant visibility into where their code is not executing as expected, we then measure these errors, collect all related data, and give our users the information they need to understand which application errors really matter and need fixing.<p>Open Roles:<p>- Director of Infrastructure (in both Bath and UK)<p>- Senior Platforms Engineer<p>- Front End Software Engineer<p>If interested, please visit our careers page and apply - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;bugsnag\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;bugsnag</a><p>*Please include a short note mentioning you saw this posting on HN.","time":1491258498,"type":"comment"}
