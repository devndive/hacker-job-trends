We have a team of 6 Software Engineers and are looking to hire a new Lead Software Engineer who can lead the team (spread across San Francisco and Uganda) in building out our financial platform (a Django web application) as well as a few other software products. We like Django (and Python generally), Node.js, and AWS.<p>We&#x27;re hiring for either San Francisco or Kampala, Uganda -- if you were based in SF, travel to Kampala a few times a year would be necessary (and weekend trips to go rafting on the Nile and rock climbing in rural Uganda are encouraged!)<p>It really is an amazing company doing really good and important work delivering solar power and financial services to people living off-grid in rural East and West Africa.<p>Contact: skeller@fenixintl.com","time":1491235443,"type":"comment"}
