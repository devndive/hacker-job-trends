We’re taking logistics data from various real-time sources to enable our customers to increase efficiency and provide lead generation by connecting them with other trucking companies. We’re onto something big but to get there we’re working through complex problems in a complex and often old-fashioned problem domain. We’re taking an unconventional approach (event sourcing with a twist and a touch of farmville) and dealing with big data to boot.<p>BACK-END POSITION<p>This isn’t a run-of-the-mill MVC app and requires solving performance and scalability problems in distributed systems using data combined from many sources, several of which are real-time sources including GPS data. Because of this complexity, we&#x27;re limiting our search to two kinds of people: experienced engineers who can bring structure to the chaos as we grow or those who can make up for lack of experience with passion and creativity. Please don&#x27;t apply unless you can demonstrate one, if not both, of these.<p>Back-end stack: Our product is built on Scala, Postgresql, Event Sourcing using Apache Beam atop Google Data Flow, Akka, and the Scala Play framework. Our front-end is predominantly AngularJS.","time":1491400644,"type":"comment"}
