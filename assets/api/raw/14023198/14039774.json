It&#x27;s a scriptable, distributed physics engine, which expands to support games of any size on PC, mobile, and console. Devs publish their game and we spin up servers for them, make physics and networking work, and overlay a friends graph &#x2F; social network to connect them to players.  Top games have 30k+ simul players, but the tail is very long.<p>We have over 40m monthly active users, and some devs on the platform are making 100k USD&#x2F;month (and are still in high school, and have hired their friends to form studios).<p>We&#x27;re hiring physics&#x2F;rendering&#x2F;networking C++ engineers, windows devops engineers (massive scale), C# (or willing to learn) full stack engineers, and data scientists.  Check it out at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;roblox.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;roblox.com</a> - it&#x27;s a downloadable client (to support native 60fps graphics).
