I am James Mitchell. The Head of Mobile Development at Black Swan London.<p>We are looking for iOS developers to work in our London or Budapest office (no remote).<p>Variety is the spice of life at Black Swan – one day you can be working on a startup project and the next on a project with over 1.1 million active monthly users (that is 99.9% crash free – not that we like to boast!). But if that’s not how you work, we are happy for you to take ownership of a project too! We work in an agency but it’s not all working at top speed, we also work smart! We use GIT flow, we love Jenkins and our code has high unit test coverage. Nothing is getting into a build without a pull request!\nYes, we are geeks and we like a chat about coding, but we also enjoy the gym, video games, movies, tv series &#x2F; boxsets and a beer on a Friday night…<p>Apply here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blackswan.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;job&#x2F;ios-developer&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blackswan.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;job&#x2F;ios-developer&#x2F;</a>","time":1491288890,"type":"comment"}
