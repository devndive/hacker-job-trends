Front end web, back end, big data, iOS&#x2F;Android. We don&#x27;t care what languages you know, as long as you&#x27;re highly skilled in at least one. We use agile and tend to use the same kinds of technologies you&#x27;d see in your typical YC startup. Email me if interested:<p>alex.krupp@thehackerati.com<p>Bonus: Just for fun we&#x27;re giving 10,000 Dogecoin to anyone who sets up an interview with us in the next two weeks. (You may have to do a couple coding problems first if you don&#x27;t already have a solid GitHub portfolio.)","time":1391286914,"type":"comment"}
