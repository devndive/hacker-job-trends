Our dev team is pretty badass (and not just badass for an agency, but in general). We do everything from WordPress sites to our own products to custom web and mobile apps, with a strong tilt towards custom social apps (Facebook targeted sharing especially). I&#x27;m proud of our portfolio -- check it out here: <a href=\"http://enga.ge/work/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;enga.ge&#x2F;work&#x2F;</a>.<p>Anyway, we are looking for a college student with back or front-end talent (PHP&#x2F;MySQL or Javascript&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;CSS). Must be in the DC area or willing to relocate; foreigners welcome as long as you can secure a J-1 or have an F-1.<p>To apply, please send an email to jobs@engagedc.com with the subject &quot;Developer intern from Hacker News&quot; (we&#x27;re giving HR a heads up). Include your resume, GitHub&#x2F;portfolio link and a brief description of why you want to work for us. Hope to hear from you!","time":1391307425,"type":"comment"}
