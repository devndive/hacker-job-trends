But by Q4 our software will be facilitating patient referrals for 200+ hospitals (seriously)<p>Come be the first hire - a full stack engineer who might take on the role of CTO as the company grows. We use a fairly standard Rails stack (rails, postgres, redis, capistrano, git, ec2, etc.) plus some other cool things like Mirth Connect.<p>---<p>Why is WorkMeIn a great place to work?<p>If you&#x27;re interested in, or have experience in healthcare, WorkMeIn is the place to be. We share a top floor office (sweet pic: <a href=\"http://imgur.com/ag8yiza\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;ag8yiza</a>) in downtown Nashville with an $800MM VC fund headed by the former CEO of Vanderbilt Medical. Come work with us, and the former Vanderbilt Medical CIO will knuckle bump you every day (again, seriously).<p>We are well funded, already profitable (not just the ramen kind either), and have large enterprise customers.<p>--<p>WorkMeIn&#x27;s goal is to dramatically increase the efficiency of care coordination between healthcare providers. Our software increases the efficiency of primary care physicians, provides specialist physicians with a better patient mix, and allows insurance companies and healthcare systems to help ensure patients stay in network. As a result, patients get higher quality, more affordable, more appropriate care with better outcomes.<p>I would love to hear from you whether you&#x27;re interested in joining us (awesome!) or just want to chat.
