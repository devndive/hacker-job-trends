And we need a great IT person, too. So, basically, everything.<p>You&#x27;ll get: a competitive salary&#x2F;equity package, a commute subsidy, an excellent healthcare plan, a 401k with company contributions, and big problems to solve. The company&#x27;s ping-pong obsession is, over the last few weeks, in danger of being replaced by one with Street Fighter II. And lots of my colleagues have kids, including both the co-founders, so you can expect to get home in the evening in time to see them.<p>We&#x27;ve raised over $150m (<a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/flipboard\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crunchbase.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;flipboard</a>), so we&#x27;re going to be around for the long haul.<p>Apply here: <a href=\"http://jobvite.com/m?3NI5egwz\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobvite.com&#x2F;m?3NI5egwz</a> and please feel free to email me with any questions you have at andrew at flipboard.com.","time":1391295199,"type":"comment"}
