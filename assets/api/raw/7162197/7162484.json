Our core product - the SwiftStack Controller - makes it easy to configure, deploy, manage and monitor your own personal Swift[1] cluster.  It&#x27;s a Django app, with a background task and alerting&#x2F;eventing engine, a 0mq based remote execution agent to control the fleet, and statsd feeding graphite for telemetry.<p>But our core deliverable is OpenStack Swift.  OpenStack is the open-source alternative to AWS, and Swift is Object Storage (think S3).  And our team is actively driving new capabilities[2] with the open source community.<p>Our customers are managing distributed storage systems growing at dozens or hundreds of terabytes a month - we&#x27;re literally taking on big problems - wanna help?  We&#x27;re primarily a python shop, actively recruiting Sr. Engineers and opinionated UX designers who have experience working with a Django team - but we&#x27;ve got lots of room for experience at all levels, if you&#x27;re interested check us out:<p><a href=\"https://swiftstack.com/jobs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swiftstack.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a><p>[1] Swift: <a href=\"https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Swift\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.openstack.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Swift</a>\n[2] Storage Policies in Swift: <a href=\"https://swiftstack.com/blog/2014/01/27/openstack-swift-storage-policies/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swiftstack.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;01&#x2F;27&#x2F;openstack-swift-stora...</a>","time":1391277403,"type":"comment"}
