Both the client part (iOS) and the video processing backend (Python&#x2F;ffmpeg) are being actively developed in-house. We&#x27;re currently looking for a Python developer and Video Streaming Engineer, both full-time in London. Our office is at TechHub, in the heart of the Silicon Roundabout, but we&#x27;ll be moving to the new office in the same area very soon.<p>The usual job description blurb is at our landing page <a href=\"http://www.fountain-digital.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fountain-digital.com</a>, just wanted to add that we&#x27;re a well funded one year old company, with product prototype ready, now approaching first public release. It&#x27;s nine of us, with five people located in London. These will be our first hires, so your influence on the end product is only limited by your own capacity. For the same reason we&#x27;re super serious about picking the right people and should we find them, ready to treat them very well with interesting engineering tasks and cookies.<p>It&#x27;s great to work here, really. If you want to ask anything about the product, technology, or simply wanna say hi, drop me a line (I&#x27;m the CTO), my email is in the profile.","time":1391295902,"type":"comment"}
