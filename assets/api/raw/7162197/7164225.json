Both of these positions require you to be able to work in San Francisco, CA.<p>Systems engineers build and scale our infrastructure, and write mostly C, C++, and Python. These are the people working on our custom datastore. This position requires at least 2 years of experience writing systems software. Solid C experience is a plus.<p>Product engineers are full-stack developers who build the parts people interact with - reporting interfaces, APIs, dataviz stuff, and more - and write mostly Python, JS, and Less. This position requires at least 2 years of software engineering experience, no specialization required. Solid JS experience is a plus though.<p>The engineering team is still small (10), and there&#x27;s a lot of interesting stuff to do. Happy to talk details.<p>If you are interested, drop me a line - tim@mixpanel.com.","time":1391302095,"type":"comment"}
