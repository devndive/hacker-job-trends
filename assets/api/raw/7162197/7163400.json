We&#x27;re home for 35000 stores and plan to grow 3x over the next year. We care deeply about user experience and want to make e-commerce as accessible as starting a blog. As a result, more than 80% of our store owners have recommended Tictail. We&#x27;ve also recently launched Tictail Apps, a platform for third-party developers to make apps for Tictail stores.<p>We&#x27;re currently 7 people in the tech team and we&#x27;re looking to hire a few more talented engineers with a good product sense. The platform is mostly written in Python and production is currently served by Tornado, Flask and node.js. Our infrastructure is built on AWS and we use Chef for configuration management. Search is currently powered by Solr but we will soon be migrating to Elasticsearch.<p>Here&#x27;s a – somewhat outdated – blog post from Siavash, our CTO, describing the position in more detail: <a href=\"http://blog.tictail.com/post/45182662726/backend-developer-of-the-future-of-ecommerce\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.tictail.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;45182662726&#x2F;backend-developer-o...</a><p>If you&#x27;re interested, get in touch at jobs+hn@tictail.com and tell us a few things about yourself and a project you&#x27;ve enjoyed working on.
