Profitable and bootstrapped.<p>Looking for backend and frontend engineers who would like to get their hands dirty in Subversion, Git and Mercurial. You will be working on new features on the platform that may involve work on the whole stack. \nYou will be liaising directly with real users. Deployments are really quick, and you get to see the impact of your work almost immediately.<p>Stack:<p><pre><code>  - Nginx, Apache\n  - Java (Core, Wicket, Hibernate)\n  - Python (mainly for scripting)\n  - Linux\n  - AngularJS, JQuery\n  - MySQL\n  - Redis\n  - RabbitMQ\n  - Fabric\n</code></pre>\nThere are other products in the pipeline - most of which are akin to xp-dev.com (hosting&#x2F;productivity platforms). So, there is plenty of room to switch products and try out new things.<p>What we&#x27;re looking for:<p><pre><code>  - Self starters\n  - Sound understanding of programming\n    you don&#x27;t need to be a Java&#x2F;Python&#x2F;JavaScript guru\n</code></pre>\nBenefits:<p><pre><code>  - No keeping track of holidays\n  - Flexible working hours\n  - Flexible working conditions (see below)\n</code></pre>\nPosition location is remote. You&#x27;ll need to factor in working from home or from a shared space near you (all will be paid for).<p>To apply, just drop a short cover email describing yourself and your CV to rs@exentriquesolutions.com.","time":1391382927,"type":"comment"}
