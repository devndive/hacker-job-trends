We are building a large suite of software around the printer, and we are looking for multi-hat programmers in diverse fields.<p>To apply, try implementing some of the following tasks, and email them at career@pirate3d.com. We arrange flight and visa application for you (keyword: H1B, called EP in Singapore).<p>* 3D processing − write a GLSL fragment shader that renders a sphere, cylinder and cube next to each other with lighting. The vertex shader should not be used and kept minimalistic. Include in the email a discussion about your approach and how it could be extended into an actual application.<p>* iOS&#x2F;Android − write a small application allowing to scroll through hundreds of images in the style of Windows Metro UI, but vertically and with circular loading (meaning the last items are followed by the first items, the first items are preceded by the last items, and so on).<p>* 3D processing − write in your favorite language a program that scales uniformly the object of an STL file to the smallest size so that at least 99% of the points within the object can be contained inside a sphere of radius 1.0 that is entirely within the object itself. Include in the email some explanation of your approach and alternative approaches you could have taken.<p>* Security − write in your favorite language or pseudo-language a program that encrypts a short message within a single UDP datagram for a destination with known IP, port, and public key.  You don&#x27;t need to write the code of the destination. Include in the email a discussion about the trade-offs between data overhead, processing time and security of your approach.<p>* More to come at <a href=\"http://www.pirate3d.com/career\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pirate3d.com&#x2F;career</a>.","time":1391274822,"type":"comment"}
