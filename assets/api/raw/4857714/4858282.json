We mask the complexity of ordering from lots of separate shops and allow customers to place a single order online and receive all their weekly shopping in one go. It's good for the shops because it lets them reach a wider audience, and it's good for our busy customers because it allows them to support their local community.<p>We're looking for two developers, who will double the size of our current team, to work on our Rails based website and supporting applications. Ruby experience is a plus, but we're very happy to take on people without direct experience if they know how to learn - our second developer hadn't written any Ruby before starting with us.<p>More details, including how to apply, are at <a href=\"http://apply.hubbub.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://apply.hubbub.co.uk/</a>","time":1354382619,"type":"comment"}
