Our goal is to make an essential utility that people use everyday.<p>We're funded by many notable investors (you've definitely heard of them - many are top 25 on AngelList). We haven't announced our product or funding anywhere so we can focus on building.<p>If you're looking to get into an earlier stage startup (more equity, ownership, ...) that solves complex problems, then come find out what we're up to.<p>We work mainly with JS (jquery and node.js). Mobile developers should be familiar with iOS/Android. We prefer designers have technical and UX backgrounds.<p>Curious?
