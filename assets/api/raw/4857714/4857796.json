{"by":"davidw","id":4857796,"parent":4857714,"text":"Padova, Italy: the company I'm consulting for needs a front-end/UX guy.  The ideal person is someone who lives in the world of Javascript, and knows JQuery, as well as something like Backbone.js, keeps abreast of the latest developments in HTML5/CSS, and <i>also</i> has a good eye for design.  Bonus points for knowing your way around a Linux server, and having some Rails knowledge.<p>The company is <a href=\"http://www.centervue.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.centervue.com/</a> and it's a pretty cool outfit.  They make devices that take pictures of your retina, amongst other things.  The team I work with are great guys, and smart hackers.  However, we don't have a lot of UX sense, and we could also use some more front-end power on the team, which is where you come in.  Email davidw@dedasys.com if you're interested.","time":1354374377,"type":"comment"}
