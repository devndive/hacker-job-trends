We started off by interviewing some of our customers to learn about their needs.  Using that information, we held design studios and brainstorming sessions to flesh out what the actual features and user experience would be like.<p>On the front-end, we decided to build a new Javascript-powered rich UI using responsive design techniques. Many people are working on responsive design for content-based sites, but few are doing it for browser-based applications.<p>On the back-end, we designed an Event Driven Architecture that makes use of Event Sourcing. Instead of updating a relational database in-place when things change, we store a series of discrete application events. We can then replay those events to create the state of the world at any point in the past, right up to the present. (Yes, we’ve built a time machine!)<p>Does this sound like the sort of thing you’d like to do? If it is, we’d like to hear from you.<p>In return for your passion and commitment to code quality, you’ll enjoy an awesome work environment with perks like:\nUnlimited vacation days!  Yes, unlimited!\nQuarterly hackathons\nA game room and a well-stocked kitchen\nExciting events including holiday parties, picnics, talent shows, pumpkin carving and more\nCompany sponsored athletic teams\nCompetitive salary, bonus and stock options\nHealth/Dental/Vision Insurance, 401K","time":1354378194,"type":"comment"}
