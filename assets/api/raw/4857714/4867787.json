We've received a five-year contract (with optional five-year extension) to extend TeamPatent, a patent-specific customization of Edyt, for the European Patent Organization. TeamPatent will be the centerpiece of this influential IT project worth over $100m.<p>Edyt is currently seeking front-end, back-end, and full-stack developers to contribute and grow with us. We perform complex processing on a JavaScript front-end client and increasingly use Node.js on the back-end so expertise or willingness to become expert in JavaScript is a huge plus. We also use Python and PostgreSQL on Linux infrastructure to support semantics, search, and collaborative document stores.<p>We offer a collaborative environment with ample opportunities to integrate and extend open source, work with others who live and breathe code, and travel internationally. You MUST be passionate about web software as you’ll need to quickly learn our technologies and become an individual contributor who mentors others. Expect to argue over the merits of various approaches at both technical and product levels.<p>We’re located in Alameda, a lovely island in the San Francisco Bay. Alameda is great for families, with tremendous walking neighborhoods (Our office has walk score of 98!), and a 20 minute bus ride to downtown San Francisco providing a unique combination of small town atmosphere with metropolitan opportunities.<p>Edyt holds the potential to be a career-making project with enormous intellectual scope and market potential.
