We're looking for a full-time developer to become the 5th member of our team (no remote). We mostly use Python to develop our own trading platform, on top of Linux, CouchDB, Redis and ZeroMQ. Mastery of the Dutch language would be a big plus; experience with the finance world is not a requirement.","time":1354377695,"type":"comment"}
