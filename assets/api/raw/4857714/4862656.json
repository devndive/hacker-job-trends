We're very early-stage - pre-Series A and just started selling our product this summer - but we already have a good set of customers (Fortune 500s down to SMBs) and hit profitability early on. We're also very fortunate to be backed by some top-tier investors including Andreessen-Horowitz and Sutter Hill.<p>We've been able to do this while keeping the team small - we're comprised of folks from MIT, Berkeley, Google Research, Microsoft Research, IBM Research, and Yahoo Research - but we're always keeping an eye out for great people. On the technology side, we manage a sizable amount of valuable/confidential business and web crawled data. Given the traction, we're now looking for folks strong in engineering and statistics who want to get in early and grow with the company.<p>RESPONSIBILITIES<p>- Analyze and understand customers' data and pain points to develop new product features and new products<p>- Build predictive models using sophisticated algorithms to help customers prioritize and succeed<p>- Develop data mining algorithms to extract useful signals from the web and other data sources<p>QUALIFICATIONS<p>- BS/MS/PhD in Computer Science, Statistics, Math or related fields<p>- Ideally experience with analyzing data sets, formulating data problems, and building machine-learned models<p>- Familiarity with Python, Java, or R preferred<p>CONTACT<p>- <a href=\"https://www.slice-data.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.slice-data.com</a><p>- hiring@slice-data.com","time":1354484999,"type":"comment"}
