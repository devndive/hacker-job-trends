Basically, you should think like a PM, have the vision of a world-class designer, and code like a beast.<p>Asking for one person to be able to do all of these things is ambitious, sure, but you’d be working on some pretty amazing stuff.  We put a huge premium on beautiful UIs, clean re-usable front-end code, and amazing user experience. This focus has helped us become a leader in the online advertising space, and with over 100mil+ impressions per day coming from all over the world, we conduct UI A/B tests at massive scale.  Our front end is going to be your science experiment.<p>We also have some pretty amazing projects for you to work on and own.  Specifically, TrialPay is changing the way people shop by bridging the gap between the online and offline worlds.  Here’s an early demo of what we’re doing:<p><a href=\"https://instore.trialpay.com/landing/?offer_id=3503426114533148569&#38;reward=10+Credits&#38;activation_subid=2345&#38;click_id=1234\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://instore.trialpay.com/landing/?offer_id=3503426114533...</a><p>Basically users get instant rewards online for offline actions, and for the first time, brick and mortar businesses can determine the efficacy of their online campaigns (social media, pay-per-click advertising, etc.) at a granularity that’s never been possible before.  You’d be making significant contributions to the user-facing portion of this new product as well as that of our other initiatives in the mobile and social spaces, from initial design to prototyping and implementation.","time":1354385024,"type":"comment"}
