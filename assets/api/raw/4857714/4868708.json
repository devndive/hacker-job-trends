TASER International (www.taser.com) is looking for a few full time software developers to work on our Evidence.com (www.evidence.com) video evidence management solution.<p>The environment is start-uppy and driven; we want stellar engineers who like getting things done in a friendly, collegiate, low-politics environment. TASER has more equity upside than large companies and none of the \"lottery tickets\" of early stage start-ups. Familiarity with Amazon web services is a plus. We have offices in Santa Barbara and Phoenix, with an additional office opening in Seattle.<p>If interested or want more information, please email danny@taser.com. Thank you!","time":1354579332,"type":"comment"}
