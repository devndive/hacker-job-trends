We build tools that make it easy for teams and groups to tell large collaborative social media stories.  Employee's matter. :)\"<p><pre><code>    - Python/ MongoDB\n    - iOS &#38; Android\n    - Javascript( HTML5, Firefox Addons, Chrome Ext.)\n</code></pre>\nWe are a friendly bunch, and we are looking for highly skilled and friendly people to work with.  Many of us left the Midwest 4 years ago to make a great product and company here in SF, after diverging into various roles and companies we have gotten the gang back together, so to speak. Our CEO had one successful exit, and is an ex. Salesforce Director. Other members have worked/ written core libraries for Twitter &#38; MySpace, and have worked for Kabam, inboxQ and Microsoft.  We are still building the core team.<p>If you are looking to get in on the ground floor of a fast passed Enterprise Social Media team, this is the team to join.  We have fun projects ranging from mobile, big data, analytic, machine learning and large Javascript Apps.  We are trying to ship weekly, while maintaining the quality needed for an enterprise app.  We want to bring the best of the consumer web to the Enterprise.<p>Tell us what you have worked on and what you would love to work on.  Many of us go to conferences and hackathons to prototype new ideas.  Some are related to our core business and sometimes they are just created for fun.<p>If you are a smart, ambitious developer, who likes to ship code, we would like to meet you.<p>Cheers,<p>Here's to many great hacking sessions to come.<p>Justin <a href=\"http://twitter.com/@jdavid\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://twitter.com/@jdavid</a>","time":1354380800,"type":"comment"}
