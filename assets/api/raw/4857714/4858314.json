This is because background location is now available and with it we are able to build models of the user and connect key bits of information to the user's current state (think position).<p>We would love to show and tell you more!<p>We're looking for great people to join our small startup backed by top VCs.<p>Specifically:<p>Backend Software Engineers<p>The deep technology problem we face is information retrieval and machine learning. The user models we build help us make predictions and determine how and when to present information.<p>iOS Engineers<p>Weâ€™re looking for iOS engineers that can build beautiful experiences and effects, and squeeze performance out of the system.<p>Please email me at wferrell AT getsherpa.com with your resume.","time":1354383346,"type":"comment"}
