Box is an enterprise software company, but we build and design our APIs to be on par with the best consumer APIs out there e.g. Twilio, Stripe, etc (you can see our documentation here: developers.box.com/docs). All experience levels are welcome to apply.<p>- Associate Product Manager<p>Ideal for someone looking to get into product management that may not have experience as a PM already. You'll work with all areas of the company (engineering, sales, marketing, business development, other PMs) to determine what direction to take the Box platform in and figure out what the necessary steps are to get to that direction from a product perspective. As you'll be working with APIs, a strong technical background is necessary (i.e. you have enough technical clout to be an engineer)<p>If you are interested in either or both, please contact me directly: sean@box.com","time":1354388418,"type":"comment"}
