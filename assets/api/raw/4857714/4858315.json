While we work in MS and engineer systems with C++/C#/Azure and nosql backends, our team is a *nix-centric group of hackers who have used erlang, rabbit, mongo, redis, etc, etc in production systems.<p>While we are not a startup, our org is run by a serial entrepreneur with multiple exits who just likes to get things done, and our culture reflects that.  We also have the usual suspects of catered lunches, dogs barking in the office, free caltrain, and even a good bit of node.js lurking around.<p>We need hackers and engineers who know how to balance beauty with pragmatism to get systems shipped, and who find deep joy in creating beautiful systems that make a real difference in the world.<p>Contact f00biebletch at gmail.com if interested, this is the best corporate opportunity you'll ever find - stable funding, creative thinkers, risk taking encouraged, no politics, just delivering great systems.","time":1354383351,"type":"comment"}
