Our front-end is built on ReactJS, Alt (Flux variant) and LESS.<p>Our largest need is for a front-end developer (ideally with some design experience) but are also looking for a junior backend developer to help us expand to more cities.<p>If you&#x27;re interested please reach out to me personally: chris@casamatic.com","time":1446486045,"type":"comment"}
