We take patient referrals online. Why? Because patients currently move through the healthcare system via faxes and phone calls from healthcare travel agents. As a result patients frequently end up at a non-optimal specialist, if they end up with a specialist at all. Sometimes it takes more than 2 weeks just to book a referral appointment. We fix this. There&#x27;s a huge amount of value to be added (and captured) in bringing patient referrals online.<p>As a company we believe in work&#x2F;life balance, continual learning, and a friendly and productive environment. We&#x27;d love to hear from you!<p>Shoot me an email at jon@preferral.com","time":1446486982,"type":"comment"}
