Lumi was created by the founders of Last.fm.<p>We are looking for an experienced Android developer to join our small team to continue work on our app. Flexibility is important however: you should be a polyglot software developer able to learn new things and work in new areas. The server side should not be a mystery to you and we&#x27;d expect you to have had experience in a number of programming languages. iOS experience and interest, as well as a strong sense for UX are big plus points.<p>We pay competitively, so don&#x27;t let a fear of &#x27;startup salary&#x27; put you off applying - get in touch and find out if that&#x27;s going to be an issue for you.<p>To apply, either launch a CV at jobs@lumi.do, or get in touch personally if you&#x27;d like to chat first (details in my profile)<p>The Lumi app: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=done.lumi\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=done.lumi</a>\nJob spec: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lumi.do&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;app-developer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lumi.do&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;app-developer</a>","time":1446634628,"type":"comment"}
