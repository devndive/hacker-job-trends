(Yes, I know ad-blocking is all the rage these days. Come be part of the solutions by enabling sensible display ads.) We&#x27;re looking for a savvy individual who takes their personal development seriously and seeks to make a huge impact.\nYou&#x27;ll be working alongside a tight, driven team right in the heart of the profit center. Our division of Connexity works in online display advertising (aka &quot;banner ads&quot;) through real time bidding, and we run 50 to 100 million impressions each day. Our total transaction volume is between 5 and 10 billion per day, and I&#x27;d bet you a burger we&#x27;ve served ads on nearly every site you&#x27;ve ever visited.<p>#About Connexity:<p>Our team is sharp and works well together. We enjoy perks such as daily paid lunch, a 9&#x2F;80 schedule (to get every other Friday off) and unconstrained vacation; the culture of our team recognizes and respects the importance of your non-work life. Also, Ventura county is a pretty nice place to live&#x2F;work (unless you hate temperate coastal weather). If you&#x27;ve got Rails or other relevant web app experience, that&#x27;s a good start. More importantly, you&#x27;ll be eager to learn display advertising inside and out. Attitude, ambition and sound judgement trump experience with a specific set of tools.\nWe&#x27;re a small team within a medium-sized organization, and we work hard to keep the small-team vibe while availing ourselves of the best bits from the mother ship.<p>#Position 1: Rails + exposure to Scala, Hbase &amp; Kafka<p>We need someone to contribute to our Ruby on Rails app. It&#x27;s used to administer hundreds of advertising campaigns across hundreds of publisher sites. It&#x27;s not just boring CRUD. It provides a ton of control and insight to the team that operates our clients&#x27; campaigns; it&#x27;s truly the heart of our display advertising business. The business folks will know you, and you&#x27;ll find that excellence will stir up a tremendous amount of appreciation for your work. This role is a great way to learn advertising tech at scale as well as other tools. In addition to Rails work, you&#x27;d get hands on experience with Redis, Hbase, PostgreSQL, R and Scala. Several on the current team started in the Rails app and have moved into other areas of interest (low-latency RTB bidder written in C, sophisticated reporting pipelines or novel optimization algorithms).<p>#Position 2: Data Savvy, Impeccably Responsible, Scala, Storm, Hbase &amp; Kafka<p>We need someone to help build our data pipeline and optimization systems.  You&#x27;re comfortable working with distributed systems.  You have a firm grasp of data structures, operating JVM systems at scale and generally building reliable systems. We need someone with sound judgement and above-average clarity of thought and word to help drive us forward.  If you&#x27;ve wanted the opportunity to build systems that comb through billions of transactions a day, please reach out to us.<p>-- Unless you prefer to start with a HR-oriented chat, you can reach me (a lead engineer on the team) at david.larsen@connexity.com.","time":1446479536,"type":"comment"}
