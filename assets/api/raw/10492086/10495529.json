Visa assistance offered.<p>Appfolio builds modern business software.  Instead of building a product that targets many types of companies, we build software products that target specific industries.  We create all-in-one systems of record that automate and streamline everything for small and medium-sized businesses.  We currently have two products in the marketplace, one serving Law Firms (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mycase.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mycase.com</a>) and one serving Property Managers (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;appfolio.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;appfolio.com</a>)<p>This approach gives us many advantages over traditional makers of business software:<p>* By building the complete solution, we can deliver deep integration between disparate parts of the application.  Our customers don&#x27;t need to rely on IT staff to cobble together separate point solutions.<p>* Because we know the details of the business that we are serving, we can deliver a superior user experience over generic point solutions.<p>* As software takes over more and more of a company&#x27;s interaction with its customers, we can provide this software in the form of web and mobile experiences, and ensure it integrates cleanly with our system of record.<p>We are looking for full-stack software engineers who want to build products that customers love.  Our tech stack today is comprised primarily of Javascript, Ruby, Rails, MySQL, Linux, with some React, Puppet, Docker, nginx, SOLR and RabbitMQ as well.<p>Apply today!<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appfolioinc.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appfolioinc.com&#x2F;jobs</a>","time":1446500854,"type":"comment"}
