We&#x27;ve built an organization that values the impact tools in Healthcare IT can make, and doesn&#x27;t accept that the status quo of crappy offerings is a somehow inevitable consequence of industry regulation and bureaucracy.<p>We&#x27;ve been around for about five years and have a product that&#x27;s getting loads of traction and totally resetting the bar from what physicians have come to expect of their tools.<p>Our dev team is remote (across the US and Canada). We live in Slack, github, and AWS. Tech stack Python, Django, Javascript, MySQL, Redis, ElasticSearch, etc.<p>A good summary of how and why we exist lives here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;What-product-is-ElationEMR-building\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;What-product-is-ElationEMR-building</a><p>Check out <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elationemr.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elationemr.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a> or feel free to ping me if you have any questions (contact info&#x27;s in my profile).","time":1446485872,"type":"comment"}
