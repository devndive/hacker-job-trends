Hinge is an amazing dating startup because of its team, culture and product. I&#x27;m proud to work here, you can see a bit of that here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;team.hinge.co\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;team.hinge.co</a><p>I joined as #13 and now we&#x27;re 27. We&#x27;ve been growing the engineering team to iterate on more features while scaling. I originally wanted to be at Hinge so I could get some Android experience so after being on API for 9 months I switched teams. Culture has been pretty awesome so far, really like working with everyone and there haven&#x27;t been any politics. We&#x27;ve got a pretty stable 3 week release cycle on the mobile clients and backend services ship a few times a day. PMs are the best I&#x27;ve ever worked with, and the leadership are providing career development and good vision.<p>Feel free to send me an email with any questions.","time":1446477863,"type":"comment"}
