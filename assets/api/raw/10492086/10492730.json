At Custora, weâ€™re helping to turn this model on its head, using mountains of data to help our customers direct the right campaigns to the right users rather than blasting the same message to the largest audience possible.<p>We&#x27;re growing quickly and looking to fill positions from Front-End Engineering to Data Science. We&#x27;re analyzing data for well over 500,000,000 end customers, and this number is growing fast. We&#x27;re building a marketing experimentation platform that&#x27;s usable by entire marketing teams and we need your help to build new statistical models, to build the infrastructure to run those models, and to develop creative and intuitive ways of presenting our findings to our users.<p>We code in Rails, Angular, and Couscous, our distributed computation framework that runs statistical models with R and Spark.<p>Our job postings are at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.custora.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.custora.com&#x2F;careers</a>.
