We’re following in the footsteps of great companies like Gusto (formerly ZenPayroll) and Zenefits in making essential HR administration a snap for businesses large and small, and like Wealthfront, in making sound investing strategy accessible to everyone.<p>We also just closed a substantial seed round from top investors, but we’re currently just three people. If you’ve been wanting to dive into an early stage startup, this is the perfect time to start talking to us.<p>Software engineers knowledgable in (or interested in learning) React.js, Postgres, Node.js, and Golang should definitely reach out. We&#x27;re especially interested in talking to full-stack hackers.<p>Reach out to careers@captain401.com, or apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;captain401.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;captain401.com&#x2F;careers</a>","time":1446497622,"type":"comment"}
