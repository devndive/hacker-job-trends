We&#x27;re based in Montreal, Canada, funded, and working with all the agencies you&#x27;ve heard of (Cossette, Sid Lee, RG&#x2F;A) and some brands you love (Absolut Vodka, Cirque du Soleil).<p>We&#x27;re currently looking for an intermediate (+) front-end developer (AngularJS-specialized) to join our growing team! This is a great opportunity for someone who wants to get in early on a team that is blowing it up.<p>We have fun, and our project is good for the internet (if our competitors win, there will just be more ads everywhere! We are pretty anti-ad ourselves). The challenges are real, but the team is solid! We can offer a good salary, benefits, stock options, and more.<p>Please reach out to me by email or reply to learn more.<p>Cheers,<p>Dan\nCTO @ Spotful\ndlazar at bespotful dot com","time":1447108639,"type":"comment"}
