Hardly any investors write software, but YC was started by hackers so it&#x27;s natural for us to solve our problems that way.<p>The YC software is used by a relatively small number of people—mostly the YC partners and founders—but the users are sufficiently important that through them we are able to have huge leverage. YC has ambitious plans to create more innovation in the world, and the only way to reach that level of impact is to scale through software.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a couple of great hackers to join us. It&#x27;s not a job for everyone, but it could be a good fit for someone who likes startups.  If you&#x27;re a hacker, have a look at the job description: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;ycombinator&#x2F;8703c1d9-af67-4826-90e4-74b5067c4dd7\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;ycombinator&#x2F;8703c1d9-af67-4826-90e4-74...</a>. If it feels like a good fit, we’d love to hear from you.","time":1446479248,"type":"comment"}
