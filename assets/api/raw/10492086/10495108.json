We have an innovative product to virtualize the set-top box (think using old set-top boxes with a video stream rendered in the cloud), with large customers all over the world. We have operations and QA positions open in San Jose, but our core engineering group is in Hilversum, the Netherlands, where we have a really strong team of competent software and QA engineers. One thing we hear time and again from recent hires is how much they value their new colleagues, and  employees judge their own compensation as pretty good in a recent survey.<p>We&#x27;re looking for both C++ and Java developers -- though for the latter I should add we&#x27;re not looking for the enterprise business-rule kind of Java developer, but rather the systems-level Java developer. Our Java codebase is a multi-threaded (evented), very scalable distributed system with strong consistency guarantees. We have a media&#x2F;codec-related C++ code base (if you like getting your hands dirty with H.264, MPEG2 or Intel&#x27;s cool GPU-based real-time transcoding, this is for you) as well as our own cloud-based browser engine, where we pretty much run WebKit on the cloud.<p>And of course we wouldn&#x27;t be able to deliver quality product without our QA team members, both embedded in the development teams and in an integration-level System QA team.<p>Find more info here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.activevideo.com&#x2F;careers#bm-open-positions\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.activevideo.com&#x2F;careers#bm-open-positions</a><p>If you&#x27;re interested in a job (that is, if you&#x27;re not a recruiter), feel free to email me at d.ochtman at the obvious domain.","time":1446497348,"type":"comment"}
