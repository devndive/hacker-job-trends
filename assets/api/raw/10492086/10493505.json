They&#x27;re the the best-designed, most trustworthy message crypto available to users today, and one of the only reasons they aren&#x27;t the global default is that someone needs to take over their front-end and make them the default.<p>Whisper will pay you less than almost any other company in the Bay Area (they&#x27;re entirely self-funded) but you&#x27;ll probably do more good there than you could at any company on this hiring thread, and if you succeed at the job, you&#x27;ll be an authentic hero for privacy and civil liberties. That&#x27;s not a bad calling card to have paper-clipped to your resume.<p>You don&#x27;t need to be a cryptography expert to talk to them. Also: they&#x27;re all just fantastic people, some of the best you can hope to work with.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whispersystems.org&#x2F;workworkwork&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whispersystems.org&#x2F;workworkwork&#x2F;</a><p>I have no relationship with Whisper; I&#x27;m just an admirer.","time":1446486140,"type":"comment"}
