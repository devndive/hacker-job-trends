We are guided by our mission and steered by metrics. We focus on the one thing that matters today. Along with a strong bias for speed and learning, we strive for excellence and elegance. We believe in being open and honest with one another. We believe in obsessing over our users, not our competitors. We are a perpetual work in progress.<p>We have openings for fullstack software engineers (Ruby experience a plus) as well as openings on our mobile team.<p>We&#x27;re also hiring some non-technical people! Operations&#x2F;finance, product management, design, and account managers.<p>Our job board is here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twenty20.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twenty20.com&#x2F;jobs</a><p>You can also email me (our lead recruiter) at john[at]twenty20[dot]com :)","time":1446491191,"type":"comment"}
