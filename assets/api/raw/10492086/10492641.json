We recruit exceptional software developers so we can provide engineering services to companies that need top developers, like CenturyLink, Walt Disney Pictures or Microsoft. When these companies need expert engineering help on projects, they come to us and our developers are embedded on their teams.<p>What makes us unique is that we have an internal startup incubator. We encourage our developers to work on side projects they are interested in and try to grow them into new startups. We support them with mentoring, funding and bonuses. We&#x27;ve launched several new products, including a successful analytics startup (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.numetric.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.numetric.com</a>). Even if side-projects don&#x27;t take off, developers still have an awesome time working on things they are passionate about and gain experience learning new tech.<p>Our compensation and benefits are great too. So you get the safety of a full-time job and the excitement of building new products.<p>We hiring for developers with expertise in pretty much every area: iOS, Android, ASP.NET MVC, node.js, Java, etc.<p>Interested? contact robert@attackpattern.com","time":1446480704,"type":"comment"}
