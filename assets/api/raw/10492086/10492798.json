The vast majority of substance abuse sufferers receive treatments that are not scientifically validated.  Mocobe will take the latest scientific research and use it to deliver treatment on the web and by mobile device, to bring low cost, high effectiveness treatment into hospitals, prisons, schools, and the courts.  We have seed funding, a CTO, free co-working space from Homebrew, and a scientific advisory board.  All we need is you: One more talented front-end dev, ideally with experience in React and Meteor, and a designer.  Get in on the ground floor in a business that will make you want to get up in the morning to help someone. Contact us at info@mocobe.co.
