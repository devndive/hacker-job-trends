We&#x27;re Nylas. We build N1, the extensible, open source extensible email client, and the infrastructure powering it. We&#x27;re looking for fronted application engineers (React, Electron, JS), designers, backend systems engineers, and infrastructure&#x2F;operations engineers.<p>We launched N1 a month ago, have accumulated 11K stars on GitHub, and are looking for core application engineers to design an extensible platform around email, calendar, and contacts. You&#x27;ll not only be using modern web tech to build a better email experience, you&#x27;ll be designing the developer platform to power the next generation of email apps.
