We&#x27;re one of Silicon Valley&#x27;s best kept secrets – we manufacture printed circuit boards (PCB’s) for thousands of customers nation-wide, including engineers at some of the world&#x27;s biggest tech companies.<p>You will be working with our dedicated development team to turn design into reality, so a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and web-friendly design is required. Ideal candidates should be strong communicators able to prototype a design at varying levels of detail and articulate the reasoning behind design decisions.<p>We don&#x27;t have enough design work to hire a designer full-time, but there is consistent work and we would like to cultivate a long term relationship.<p>I’m Mihir, Director of Special Projects here at Royal, and a former electrical engineer at Tesla and Taser. If you’re interested in joining our team, send your resume to jobs@royalcircuits.com and we’ll get back to you right away! Please submit a portfolio or body of work with your application.","time":1525206316,"type":"comment"}
