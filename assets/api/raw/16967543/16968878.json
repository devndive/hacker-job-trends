We have the good fortune of starting from a clean slate and are able to use the latest and greatest frameworks and tools.  You will work with an excellent team of engineers, product managers and designers on a variety of interesting projects in the Bakery Square area of Pittsburgh.<p>We are still picking out our stack, but are strongly leaning towards Scala on the backend.  We haven&#x27;t settled on our front-end framework (Angular?  React?  Other?) and are about to start evaluating mobile frameworks.  This is a great opportunity to help us choose our platform and create what, in a few short years, will be legacy code :-).<p>We currently only have the DevOps and Front End roles posted, but are also looking for Mobile engineers, a Director of Engineering and QA Engineers.
