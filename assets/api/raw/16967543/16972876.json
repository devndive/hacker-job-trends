We&#x27;re back by Y Combinator (S16), Polychain Capital, and many other leading institutional investors.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a scientist with expertise in fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to assist with our research efforts on performance improvements and potential applications for smart contracts. Familiarity with related technologies like proxy re-encryption (PRE) and multi-party computation (MPC) is helpful.<p>Ideally, candidates have an understanding of the surrounding issues and problems and have an interest in identifying potential solutions. Due to the unproven and highly theoretical nature of these schemes, candidates should be willing to pivot research when practical solutions cannot be found.<p>Please email founders@nucypher.com with your CV and any previous research&#x2F;publications you&#x27;re able to share.","time":1525219050,"type":"comment"}
