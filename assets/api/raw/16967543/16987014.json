Founded in 2008 at the inception of programmatic, we were one of the first practitioners globally and a pioneer in Europe. Today, we run global programmatic campaigns for leading advertisers from our offices in London and Singapore. On any given day we have campaigns live in over 30 countries. Each month we process more than 750 billion ad decisions and hundreds of terabytes of data. Unlike most agencies we have built our own RTB infrastructure from the ground up, to suit our way of working.<p>Our RTB infrastructure at a core is written in Go, with supporting services using Ruby, Python and whatever fits. Our infrastructure is powered by a mixture of GCP&#x2F;Mesos and Marathon supported by an internally written ETL scheduler which you will help develop and maintain. Some of the other technologies we use include Kafka&#x2F;Cassandra&#x2F;Docker&#x2F;Redis&#x2F;Clojure and much more.<p>We&#x27;re hiring for software engineers who can help work on our internal data platform.
