I&#x27;m looking to hire 4 devs during the next 2 months for Azure Notebooks - basically Jupyter as a Service. You can check it out at (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notebooks.azure.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notebooks.azure.com</a>). It&#x27;s a mix of C#&#x2F;.Net (FE) and Linux&#x2F;Docker (BE).  Local (Redmond) is preferred, but exceptions can be made!  Looking for both frontend and backend web devs.<p>Ideal candidates have 4+ years of relevant industry experience.<p>If interested, pls send your resume to pythonjobs@microsoft.com with the subject &quot;AZNB&quot;.<p>Thanks!","time":1525195963,"type":"comment"}
