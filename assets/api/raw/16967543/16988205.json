We work across a range of industries from agriculture to steel to nuclear, complementing our range of OEM instrumentation. The work is always interesting and you&#x27;ll be working on applying cutting edge computer vision techniques to real world engineering problems.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a software&#x2F;electrical engineer to join our team (if you describe yourself as a maker or a hacker, we&#x27;re interested!). The job will primarily be software focused, using C++ and Python. Experience with computer vision libraries like OpenCV would be useful, along with Qt and ROS. Bonus if you&#x27;ve used HALCON or have some machine learning experience, no matter how small. There&#x27;s plenty of scope for hardware work as well as software development and you will be expected to work both independently and within collaborations.<p>Applicants should have a degree in physics or an engineering discipline (including computer science). Research experience, e.g. a PhD would be welcomed. Preference will be given to applicants with prior experience in 3D imaging or robotics.<p>Feel free to contact us at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;is-instruments.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;is-instruments.com</a> or <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i3drobotics.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i3drobotics.com</a>","time":1525370460,"type":"comment"}
