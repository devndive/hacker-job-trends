Our software, hardware, and service platform enables the owners and managers of multifamily properties (think, apartment buildings) to offer smart homes as an amenity to their residents while also improving the efficiency of their operations. In the last few months we&#x27;ve invested heavily in the metering and data analysis side of our business. And we have been integrating with devices outside of apartment units to bring entire buildings online.<p>The engineering work we do has hardware (IoT, cellular, zwave and other forms of connectivity) and cloud (AWS, Twilio Sync) components. We are especially interested in talking to engineers who build with Python, Rust, and Scala. However, anyone who loves to see their software manifest real life effects on the corporeal world, or do predictive analytics on millions of sensor readings from networked devices, or create a magical and eminently accessible experience in the homes and communities of our residents and the operations teams that support them should talk to us.<p>I&#x27;m at scott at dwelo dot com","time":1525220138,"type":"comment"}
