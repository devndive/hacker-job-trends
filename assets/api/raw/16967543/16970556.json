It often feels like a startup atmosphere because you can have a huge impact on the business, but we are far more stable than a startup and have a good work-life balance.<p>Our back-end services are all Python and front-end is React and es6. We are also hiring for mobile development, iOS (Swift) and Android developers (Kotlin).<p>We offer all the things you&#x27;d expect, plus you&#x27;ll get to work with a group of diverse, fun people on a social project that really matters. We&#x27;re fundamentally about bringing people together, face to face. We judge ourselves on how many real life events we can help make happen.<p>evite.com&#x2F;jobs","time":1525202932,"type":"comment"}
