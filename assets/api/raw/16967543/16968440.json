Our goal is to invest in promising people around the world working on AI. We think the world is filled with extraordinarily productive people that don&#x27;t come from a traditional background. We&#x27;re making software that screens for them and supports them with a community. We&#x27;re a very small team. We&#x27;ll remain small for a long time. We&#x27;re looking for a generalist who can build web and mobile products without much detailed guidance. ML experience a plus.<p>Lack of a credentialed resume is fine. The only thing we&#x27;ll be looking for is experience <i>building lots of stuff</i>. Even a bunch of side-projects on Github. We like working with people on-site, but we&#x27;re happy to start remote if there&#x27;s a path towards eventual relocation.<p>Just email us to apply: team@aigrant.org. Include your resume and let us know if you&#x27;re already in the Bay Area.","time":1525191541,"type":"comment"}
