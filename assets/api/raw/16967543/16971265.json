I get mentioned in this post every month right at the top.<p>The programming is mostly Javascript.<p>We&#x27;re passionate about making things suck less and our users being happy. We also have a no jerks policy so the work environment is really healthy and relatively low stress for a fast paced startup.<p>We&#x27;d like nice, highly competent people who are big fans of listening to customers.<p>The service is a fleet of rental cars like zipcar with ads on them. This makes them effectively free rentals. We have about 150 active cars and about 250 more owned but not yet onboarded. We&#x27;ve been on shark tank, in most major news rags, npr, and have tens of thousands of users.<p>Urban mobility is also becoming a fairly trendy space if you care about being hip.<p>It&#x27;s salaried, benefits, options, the usual startup package.<p>It&#x27;s an important time of growth for us as a company. If you&#x27;re interested just email me directly at chris@waivecar.com.","time":1525206846,"type":"comment"}
