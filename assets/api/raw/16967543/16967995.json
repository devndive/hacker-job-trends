Millions of farmers globally don&#x27;t have access to the basic farm tools the rest of the world depends on for food production, good seed and fertilizer. We sell these proven agricultural tools on credit, and use satellite data and ML to figure out who we can lend to profitably.<p>We use Scala, Python&#x2F;NumPy&#x2F;SciPy (for science&#x2F;ML), android and are heavy postgres users. We&#x27;re building great software for places with low reliability networks and harsh environmental conditions. We&#x27;re getting ready to support a broad, fast rollout of a pesticide loan to counteract Fall Armyworm in rural Kenya. A new past in the region that&#x27;s, armyworm has previously devestated crops wherever it&#x27;s gone and our loan might be the only way huge numbers of farmers can afford to save their crops.<p>To apply, send me an email at earl@apolloagriculture.com","time":1525189349,"type":"comment"}
