We are a small team of remote developers in India working along with the product team in NY. Dev team - 4. Overall company size - 12.<p>What: We’ve developed a web-based app designed to interest students and make them more successful at reading. It provides teachers with detailed analytics to drive learning intervention. We&#x27;re now working on scaling the product and providing advanced features to aid student learning and empower teachers with more tools to help them see how to guide their students.<p>Why: We don’t do it just because it’s interesting (though it is). We do it because we’re obsessed with solving one of the most catastrophic, under-acknowledged problems in the US and the world: year after year, students graduate high school without being able to read at the level that is required for success in college and in life.<p>Where: New York, Bangalore &amp; other Indian cities.<p>Apply to us through AngelList:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;zinclearninglabs&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;134957-senior-ruby-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;zinclearninglabs&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;134957-senior-ruby-en...</a>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;zinclearninglabs&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;348137-frontend-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;zinclearninglabs&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;348137-frontend-engin...</a>","time":1526254483,"type":"comment"}
