[…pause…] That’s what we thought. You can’t remember, because you use a credit card to  pay bills or buy things online. If you’re a small business (think bike shop, book store, physical therapist, flower stand, pet store, … ) owner, inventory-buyer, accountant, etc, your answer probably would have been: Yesterday. Tomorrow. Every day. B2B commerce is rapidly catching up with consumer commerce — it’s moving online — but the payments infrastructure for invoicing hasn’t. Rumbleship solves this.<p>What We Believe\nWe believe that B2B tools should be as clean, clear, and usable as consumer tools, and we believe that the best way to build this is to have a team from all walks of life. Your experience with buying is different from anybody else’s experience with buying, and it is critical to have a diversity of opinions to build the best tooling there is. Come build the last interesting thing in e-commerce.<p>Roles:<p>- Engineer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rumbleship.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rumbleship.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a>\n- Designer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rumbleship.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rumbleship.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a>","time":1525202157,"type":"comment"}
