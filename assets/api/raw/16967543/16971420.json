We are building tools for property managers that were previously only available to big airlines and hotels. Our customers love us - before they were setting prices by gut - now we a provide real, measureable benefit to their businesses.<p>Our stack is Django and Ember.js, but experience in any specific technology isn&#x27;t required. We especially would love to hear from you if you have started your own startup before, and if you&#x27;ve been an airbnb host. No coding challenges - just share with us something that you&#x27;ve built that you&#x27;re proud of.<p>We&#x27;re well-funded and profitable. We offer flexible work hours, significant equity, competitive salary, equipment budget, medical, dental, vision and 401k.<p>Email us at jobs@beyondpricing.com","time":1525207628,"type":"comment"}
