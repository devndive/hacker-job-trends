In a nutshell, we build tools that allow app owners to segment, understand, and communicate with their users without having to build a sophisticated system in-house. We're currently a team of 15 (which is as laid back and enjoyable as you'd expect), and have a fun and exciting work environment.<p>We're looking for a broad scope software developer to help build our SDK backend and developer web dashboard. We're tackling a variety of cutting-edge problems, from efficiently delivering real-time analytics for millions of transactions to designing blazing fast, ultra-responsive web applications. We use a diverse technology stack rooted in Rails, Coffeescript and MongoDB, but we're always open to incorporating new technologies. Experience with specific technologies is not a requirement.<p>Mobile experience is also a plus, and we're also hiring mobile engineers (both Android and iOS).<p>Please email jobs [at] appboy.com with your resume / Github profile / etc. (I'm the guy that will read your email, this isn't a faceless corporate resume drop). We don't care about flowery cover letters, but mentioning that you saw this post is a plus. Look forward to hearing from you!","time":1364832430,"type":"comment"}
