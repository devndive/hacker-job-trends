The bloggers get to interact and work with the editors, and the brand gets to build a network of bloggers that love them. It's a win-win all around.<p>We're hiring a web developer (PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JS). You'll be working on building new websites and maintaining existing ones. We're a small team with a lot of momentum, so you'll get to play with a little bit of everything -- you won't just be making widgets all day.<p>Anyone in the US is welcome to apply. We pay the most attention to applicants that have experience building websites; we also like people who have done a few side projects just for fun.<p>Email relevant information (resume, cover letter, etc) to php@tid.al. Hope to hear from you!","time":1364825139,"type":"comment"}
