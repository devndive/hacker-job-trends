We ship instrumentation extensions for a growing list of web servers and application languages (Python, Ruby, Java, PHP, Apache, Nginx, Lighttpd, etc) that follow &#38; monitor web requests as they are forwarded between processes and servers.<p>We sit atop mountains of data and strive to provide intelligent, actionable insights for our customers about the performance of their app's code &#38; servers.  Processing &#38; visualizing it all (at scale) is a big challenge, and weâ€™re looking for talented engineers to help us.<p>Our current (and growing) \"big data\" stack consists of have a data faucet and processing pipeline that does a ton of writes (Python, Cassandra, Hadoop, MySQL, Celery, C/C++, etc), a web backend that does a comparably lower number of reads (Python), and an elegant, powerful interface (Backbone, D3, jQuery).  We also use TBone, a Backbone library that we open-sourced that automagically manages data dependencies for you: <a href=\"http://tbonejs.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://tbonejs.org</a><p>We're a small team backed by a strong, growing company that is investing heavily in our product's future.  Our work is distributed, agile, and test-driven.  We're based in Boston, MA, with an office in Providence, RI.
