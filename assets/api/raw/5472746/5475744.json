We believe that if you hire intelligent people, the worst thing you can do is tell then tell them what to do.<p>Our mission is to help people. So you won't be working on a tweak of anything that is already in existence. We exist to innovate.<p>For example, every real estate start-up has put effort into map UIs, forms and listings. We'll open up our unique and high quality data set for them to exploit their UI (and build/innovate where they are strong). We do believe that only by collaborating will the toughest problems be solved.<p>There is reason I've gone into so much detail about our values: everything else is arbitrary. I'm sure you can problem solve. I'm certain your JavaScript is clean and beautiful. But if our incentives aren't aligned with yours, we shouldn't be working together.<p>If you want to help people, focus on innovating and build all day long, say hi: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/WigwammHQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://twitter.com/WigwammHQ</a><p>More info about Wigwamm: <a href=\"http://blog.wigwamm.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.wigwamm.com</a>","time":1364848547,"type":"comment"}
