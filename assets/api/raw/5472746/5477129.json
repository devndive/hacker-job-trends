We are growing rapidly, and have around 3 million active users each day across around 500 mobile applications.<p>We have been actively targeting the Android mobile market, and just recently released our SDK for iOS. We are in need of the most help from a couple of talented engineers to help maintain and extend these SDKs.<p>If you are more interested in either front or backend web development, or more of a generalist, we are definitely interested in talking to you as well.<p>You'd be joining a small but very talented and tight-knit team of developers working at all levels of the stack, from postgres up through rails and into the platforms I mentioned above. From my own personal experience so far, the environment here is amazingly hacker-friendly. You will be able to ship code early and often with zero red tape, be given a very large amount of autonomy, and feel your impact on the company every day.<p>Feel free to visit our jobs page to learn more: <a href=\"https://pocketchange.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://pocketchange.com/jobs</a><p>If this sounds like something you might be interested in, contact me at ed@pocketchange.com and I'll be happy to answer any of your questions.","time":1364865728,"type":"comment"}
