We have an existing app but, honestly, it sucks; you'd be rebuilding the apps from scratch.<p>We are a small, close-knit team of 5 full time people. The technical team consists of a backend engineer (me) and a front-end engineer, plus a remote backend developer. You would be the first mobile developer. We're looking for someone who has experience building either iOS or Android apps (both is even better) so you can hit the ground running. Other than that, we are open to a wide range of candidates - if you are a solid engineer, are highly innovative, and are excited about a fast-paced environment where your ideas will be heard, then please contact me at adam-at-coffeeemeetsbagel-dot-com.<p>Disclaimer: though it can help, even working at a dating startup can't guarantee that you will find a date.","time":1364837010,"type":"comment"}
