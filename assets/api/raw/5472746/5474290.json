We started as a design company doing custom B2C eCommerce and Content Management System implementations. Lately we've been successful at providing consulting, design, and development services to select early seed stage startups. When working with startups, our goal is to get something investor/startup ready with tight budgets, while still providing a solid foundation that can be built on. We primarily work with companies in the Cleveland and Chicago areas.<p>Our technology stack is Python/Django and Bootstrap on the frontend, but prefer to stay technology-agnostic so while knowledge of them is helpful they are not requirements. DevOps/TDD/UX/Design skills all bonuses.<p>If interested, contact us at: jobs@bablmedia.com","time":1364835449,"type":"comment"}
