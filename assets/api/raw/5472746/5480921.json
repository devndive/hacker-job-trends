We're hoping to add 4 developers in the next month and grow quickly over the next year and a half. Because we're small, you'll be expected to be able to take a project and own it. We deploy frequently so your code will be in the wild within the first couple days after you join us.<p>Our culture is fun and lighthearted, but we love getting shit done. We're right on South Park, right in the heart of SOMA. It's Twitter's first office, Instagram's first office and of course our office, so there's lots of good startup magic here.<p>We're offering good salaries, full benefits and equity. Also the chance to work at a company that's building awesome technological solutions that will positively benefit the planet.<p>If you're interested, email Jennifer Hemmings, our awesome HR manager: hr@1bog.org","time":1364925148,"type":"comment"}
