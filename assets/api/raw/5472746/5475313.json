{"by":"mrkurt","id":5475313,"parent":5472746,"text":"MongoHQ (SF Bay)<p>We do database operations and hosting, and recently raised an A-round. We're hiring to solve a lot of different problems, but especially looking for help with:<p><i>Backend engineering</i> - If your ideal work day involves building software to run across hundreds of systems and care about databases, you are someone we want to talk to. We have everything from server level monitoring/control agents to protocol proxies to backend metrics systems that need love.<p><i>Operations/devops</i> - If you have used chef/puppet or similar, get irritated about \"snowflakes\" (one off servers), and have a sometimes irrational desire to automate everything, you are someone we want to talk to. We are one of the companies where operations is the product, so work on the backend systems will often make its way in front of users.<p>[Whatever you do well] - If you have some combination of skills that you think we need, let us know why we should be thinking about them.<p>----------------------------------------------<p>Our tech \"stack\" is largely node.js/Ruby/Mongo/Redis (and now Erlang), we've experimented with various languages and other databases. We generally believe in using the right tool for a give job. If you want to tackle a particular problem with OCaml, for instance, you probably won't face much friction.<p>We have an office right next to the Caltrain in San Mateo (15 mi south of SF) and are willing to let people work remotely if they can do it well. We will also cover relocation for good people. Our priority is \"people who get things done, sometimes in anger\" and almost everything else is negotiable.<p>If you're interested, email hello@mongohq.com and ask us some questions (or tell us a story). If you want to talk to me directly, mrkurt@gmail.com. Candidates only, no recruiters or agencies please.","time":1364844623,"type":"comment"}
