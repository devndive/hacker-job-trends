{"by":"speleding","id":5479052,"parent":5472746,"text":"Amsterdam -- Full time -- Full stack developer, Rails/JS focus -- SuperSaaS.com<p>SuperSaaS develops the highly successful online scheduling website www.supersaas.(com|de|fr|it|jp|nl|\\w\\w).<p>Scheduling is a hard problem: To determine the space available for an appointment you need to take into account opening hours, existing appointments, holidays, availability of linked resources such as treatment rooms, and about ten other things. Now do that for every page view and API call and in such a way that it can scale to thousands of clients. And this needs to be presented in a way the user understands in 25 different languages (including right-to-left), multiple currencies, multiple time zones and needs to look good on a variety of devices.<p>As can be expected in a nascent billion dollar market there are many competitors, but unlike many other markets the usability and the quality of the algorithms make a big difference to business success. This means a great programmer can get the respect he deserves here: Above average salary, equity options, pick your own equipment, extremely flexible working hours. SuperSaaS is still tiny but has been consistently profitable since going live 5 years ago, while enjoying triple digit growth rates.<p>Interested?
