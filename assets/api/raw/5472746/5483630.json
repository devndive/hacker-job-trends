Our tools are heavily used by everyone from volunteers down to primary campaign staff (and often the candidates themselves).  We mostly focus on field organizing, fundraising, and online organizing, but if you've got a good idea about how to effect progressive change through technology, we have pretty solid market penetration for scaling it.<p>Our biggest apps are in .NET (one webforms/ADO, one MVC/EF, both up to date framework-wise), but we also work on Drupal sites, our iOS and Android apps, newer node.js services, and js clients that keep getting thicker, but in a good way.<p>More info at <a href=\"http://www.ngpvan.com/about/jobs/senior-developers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ngpvan.com/about/jobs/senior-developers</a> - I know this has a jobs@ngpvan.com email, but I swear real people including me read everything that comes in.","time":1364953124,"type":"comment"}
