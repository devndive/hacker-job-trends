We’re helping Stack Overflow, Reddit, and other sites that you’ve probably heard of serve billions of ads per month. At that scale, things get very interesting.<p>Adzerk engineers are responsible for working on all parts of the system. This includes the front-end web application, back-end services, and the ad delivery engines. Our platform is built using Node.js with Coffeescript, Mono, JQuery, MongoDB and Hadoop, with a whole lot of AWS and Chef. We’re currently serving over 10,000 req/sec (and growing fast), so you’ll get to work on some real scalability challenges.<p>Performance and scalability are our two primary concerns, and with the traffic and growth rates that we’re experiencing, lots of the lessons that you’ve learned start to break down. Because of that, it’s not as important what you know right now – what matters is how quickly you can learn and adapt.<p>- Your work will have an immediate and profound impact on our product and business.<p>- We ship code dozens of times a week, and you will write code and push to production on your first day.<p>- You will be responsible for making important decisions about what tools and libraries we use.<p>- You will have a direct role in building the team, helping us choose additional team members as we grow in size.<p>- We test and review our code. All changes come through pull requests.<p>- We prize open source contribution. You should have a GitHub account already.<p>- Everyone gets equity. We want a team of partners.<p>- Unlimited vacation. We work hard, but at a sustainable pace.<p>- Flexible work schedule, including working at home part-time if you want.<p>If you think you might be a great fit, drop us a line at jobs@adzerk.com.","time":1364826057,"type":"comment"}
