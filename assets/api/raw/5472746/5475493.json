Gyms do not work for 89% of Americans, but yet they are a $21B industry thanks to recurring fees. We are trying to change that by bringing the Gym to your home over live video and thus eliminating waste. If the country gets a little more fitter using our platform, thats all the more good.<p>We want you to come help us engineer this transition. We are doing what AirBnb, Uber and others did with excess capacity in their markets to fitness professional market.<p>Our customers love us. Every 2 out of 3 users who works out with one of our trainers comes back for more. We just recently launched Group workouts. We just graduated from Rock Health and have some great investors who get marketplaces like us. We make money when users pay to workout with a trainer. And our prices are a fraction of the gym costs thanks to efficiencies we provide.<p>We use our own platform to keep ourselves healthy. No one has yet got a six-pack but we could probably all run long distances comfortably. We are a small team, so your impact and influence on our culture will be huge. Almost all of us have worked at other companies before so while we dont have nerf guns, we still know how to have fun.<p>Our technical stack is Python/Django and MySQL. We also use Fabric, NGinx, Apache, Celery, Redis and RabbitMQ. We also use services like CircleCI, Optimizely, MixPanel, SegmentIO and Asana for getting things done.<p>Contact us at dev@wello.co.","time":1364846305,"type":"comment"}
