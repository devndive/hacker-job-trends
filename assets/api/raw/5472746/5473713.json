Our need is for an organized self-starter that is fairly technical to take over the onboarding and project-direction for new customers of our platform. You'll also be dealing with product development, learning how our infrastructure works and coming up with ideas to increase customer happiness. We always hire with upward mobility in mind; do a great job and we will make sure you benefit from it.<p>We're a small startup of 4 people, well-funded and growing rapidly located in downtown San Diego. Our software platform is in the ad-tech space, but we also deal with hardware, large scale data processing and crap-tons of other bleeding-edge tech. We have a flexible-time &#38; vacation policy with fantastic benefits (one hell of a cadillac health plan). Our two rules are: get shit done and be here for the morning meeting each day.<p>This is a job that rewards people that can improvise and have a relentless attitude towards quality. There is no frying pan in our business, only a fire - but we give you a hell of a flameproof suit and reward accordingly for your effort.","time":1364830801,"type":"comment"}
