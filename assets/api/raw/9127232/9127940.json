We have ~25 computers in house, some powering 2x2 and 3x3 video walls of up to 138 inches (with a PS3 hooked up too!). We need to set up several test environments as our software will run on both Windows and Linux. We&#x27;ll also need some mundane things like file shares as we want to give our current Windows Server 2012 the boot.<p>We haven&#x27;t made any of the big decisions yet as we&#x27;re waiting for someone with more experience to come and join the team. So that means we&#x27;ll be working together to figure out whether to use Chef, Vagrant, Docker, Salt, Puppet, or something else. We&#x27;re extremely open to new technologies and get to work with what are essentially giant toys.<p>We&#x27;ve done projects in the past for NASA, FIFA, US Army, nuclear power plants, electric companies, and departments of transportation. Our software has been installed in over 30 countries and now we&#x27;re looking to take the next step forward which we can&#x27;t do without a bit more organization &#x2F; streamlining. That&#x27;s where you come in.","time":1425230709,"type":"comment"}
