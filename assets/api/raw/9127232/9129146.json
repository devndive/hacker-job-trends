We&#x27;re growing rapidly and looking for software (node.js) engineers.<p>We&#x27;re focused on building a profitable long-term business with a product our customers love. We don’t compete with Google on start-up perks, but we can more than compete if you’re looking to sink you teeth in and make a difference:<p>* Impact: we’re expecting anyone that joins to come in and have a major impact. We’re small enough that every customer interaction, every marketing spend, every line of code has an over-sized impact.<p>* Equity: we don’t need hired-guns, we need team members. We want to share our long-term vision and success, and make sure you have equity in that journey.<p>* Autonomy: we don’t look for specific roles, we look for good fits. You’ll be able to contribute with your strengths and determine the projects you want to drive forward.<p>* Flexibility: supporting our chosen lifestyles is major part of our success equation. Join a remote team and create your own hours. Work how and where you want to.<p>* Culture: we work hard but also don’t take ourselves too seriously and make sure we have a great time along the way.","time":1425248329,"type":"comment"}
