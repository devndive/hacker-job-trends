In startup talk, you could say, &quot;we are a venture-backed company disrupting a multi-billion dollar industry.&quot; In real talk, we&#x27;re bringing modern, elegant software to a field that still relies on fax machines and manilla envelopes holding vital documents. We are bringing security, efficiency and joy to a paper-based office.<p>About you: You&#x27;ve got 2-5 years experience building web apps. You&#x27;re interested in owning a product, everything from calling clients to wireframes to writing code and analyzing metrics.<p>More about us: We&#x27;re growing fast (double-digit month-over-month).
