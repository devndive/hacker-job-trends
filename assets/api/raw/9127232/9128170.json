While remote is possible, we like people to be in pairs or more, whenever possible. It&#x27;s more fun, anyway.<p>We love these people:<p>1. Go developers; crypto experience a big plus<p>2. Those with platform-specific GUI experience: we&#x27;re currently working on an OSX app and will be expanding to Windows, iOS, and Android soon.<p>3. Very product-oriented engineers. This is the kind of person who&#x27;d enjoy wireframing or planning smart notifications just as much as doing either front or back end development (probably not both). Since we&#x27;re pretty small, this person would do a mix of things: user interface design (very usable, but to be polished by others), actual programming, making sure everything about the site is smooth to use.  I know in a lot of companies this is often a graphic designer or dedicated interface person, but from what I learned at our last project (OkCupid), I think product-sensitive developers can be the best at it.<p>We have yet to take any formal funding.<p>If you&#x27;re interested: chris@keybase.io","time":1425233532,"type":"comment"}
