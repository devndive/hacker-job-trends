REDI is a mature startup dedicated to taking an already successful trading platform to the next level. As a tech company that operates in the financial trading industry, we have a very different perspective and approach. Our next-generation platform is focused on building a community for the buy-side, sell-side, and technology providers, bridging the Wall Street and the FinTech startup spaces. We take a highly open and collaborative approach to building our technology (everything from C++, Java, .NET, Ruby, Angular, NodeJS, Chef, etc). We need individuals with a passion for technology, and an unparalleled drive to deliver world-class software across the desktop, web, and mobile contexts. Financial knowledge is not required, but a strong engineering mindset and razor-sharp problem solving skills are a must.<p>Roles (FULL-TIME, H1B, VISA supported) ::<p><pre><code>  - Software Engineers\n  \n  - DevOps Engineers\n\n  - Test Engineers\n\n  - Product Managers\n\n</code></pre>\nWe&#x27;d love to hear from you.
