Users pull out their phone and start from scratch with an empty search box. There is no context for the task at hand, and no history of the user&#x27;s preferences. It won&#x27;t be this way for long, your computer has an incredible volume of data about you stored in email and in calendar so a world where this rich context is put to use to make your life easier is inevitable. We are building rich user profiles and analyzing the tasks each user needs to accomplish in real time -- so that when a user pulls out their phone, they are proactively presented with personalized solutions.<p>This is a full time position with a competitive salary, benefits and equity in the company.<p>To apply, please send me an email at wferrell AT gmail.com","time":1425233971,"type":"comment"}
