We believe that what we&#x27;re working on is the biggest financial and social impact opportunity in the world today.<p>Enlitic uses recent advances in machine learning to make medical diagnostics faster, more accurate, and more accessible. Founded by Kaggle&#x27;s past president and chief scientist (that&#x27;s me!), its mission is to provide the tools that allow physicians to fully utilize the vast stores of medical data collected today, regardless of what form they are in - such as medical images, doctors&#x27; notes, and structured lab tests. To realize this vision, we are building on state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and partnering with top research hospitals and medical device manufacturers. We&#x27;ve raised $5m funding and have a small team of 10 applied machine learning experts.<p>No medical or life sciences background is necessary. We are looking for people that have an in depth understanding of linear algebra, convex optimization, algorithm design, and software engineering, to join us us data scientists and engineers. Python, C++, and CUDA experience is helpful - but the proven ability to learn quickly is more important. We&#x27;re also looking for MD&#x2F;PhDs with physics or comp sci backgrounds to help us brings the worlds of medicine and machine learning together.<p>Have a look at our team to see whether you think you might be a good fit <a href=\"http://www.enlitic.com/team.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enlitic.com&#x2F;team.html</a> . We&#x27;re interested in building a diverse team, so if you don&#x27;t fit the standard Bay Area &quot;ninja rock star programmer&quot; mold - great!<p>For more background on the company and technology, see my TED.com talk here <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/jeremy_howard_the_wonderful_and_terrifying_implications_of_computers_that_can_learn\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ted.com&#x2F;talks&#x2F;jeremy_howard_the_wonderful_and_ter...</a> .
