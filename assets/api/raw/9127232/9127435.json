We work at a scale where seemingly &quot;small&quot; improvements can have a big impact.<p>We do online display advertising, and run 50 to 100 million impressions each day.  Our total transaction volume is between 5 and 10 billion per day.<p>As you might have guessed, we&#x27;re not serving that volume through Rails itself.  Our Rails app is used to administer hundreds of advertising campaigns across hundreds of publisher sites.<p>This role is a great way to learn advertising tech as well as other tools.<p>In addition to the conventional Rails work, you&#x27;d get hands on experience with Redis, Hbase, PostgreSQL, and Scala.  Several on the team started in the Rails app and have moved into other areas of interest (low-latency RTB bidder written in C or sophisticated reporting and optimization).  Not really possible to get bored around here unless you&#x27;re a boring person.<p>Our team is sharp and works well together. We enjoy perks such as paid lunch, a 9&#x2F;80 schedule (to get every other Friday off) and unlimited vacation; the culture of our team recognizes and respects the importance of your non-work life. Also, Ventura county is a pretty nice place to live&#x2F;work. Unless you prefer to start with a HR-oriented chat, you can reach me (a lead engineer on the team) at david.larsen@connexity.com.","time":1425224847,"type":"comment"}
