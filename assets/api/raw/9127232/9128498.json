We&#x27;ve built a perfect platform to put the industry’s most powerful advertising technology in the hands of small entrepreneurs and people like you. Our goal is to provide independent sellers with more traffic and better conversion rates to power their online sales.<p>We are growing incredibly fast — our servers handle 2000 requests per second and manage more than 700 million user profiles (yes, that&#x27;s 20% of the Internet).<p>We are looking for experienced front-end developers and full-stack engineers. We use Angular&#x2F;JavaScript (with almost all ES6 features) on the front end, and Java&#x2F;Cassandra&#x2F;Redis&#x2F;Kafka&#x2F;Storm on the back end.<p>Feel free to ping me anytime at engineering@unite.io.","time":1425238154,"type":"comment"}
