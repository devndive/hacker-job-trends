We have trained machines to understand sports at a level of sophistication that exceeds that of most collegiate players.  Using this machine understanding, we deliver analytics software that is helping eight NBA teams win more games, is enabling national broadcasters to tell better stories, and will give every fan their own personal sportscast.<p>We are looking for both full stack engineers, and machine learning and computer vision engineers.  The responsibilities range from sophisticated GUI design that supports detailed but intuitive analytics, to front-end interfaces that will appear on national sports broadcasts, to scalable backend infrastructure that supports robust video streaming, to ML and CV engineering that enables the semantic layer that understands the game.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in joining us, our jobs email is is work@secondspectrum.com.
