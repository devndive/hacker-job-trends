In order to check-in, all the worker must do is to send this code as an SMS within this 30 second timeframe. Timesheets are generated automatically and are available instantaneously in the textin.io web dashboard.<p>Your job is to prospect, generate leads, engage potential customers, handle inbound leads and, most importantly, perform direct sales of:\n1) Textin platform subscription (monthly reoccurring payment)\n2) Clocker devices (one-time cost, shipped worldwide by DHL)<p>As sales, your commission will be the first 4 months of reoccurring payments from the deal you close sent to you monthly for 4 months after each payment from the client.<p>The end-price of a single Clocker device to the client is ~10$ (depending on amount). Shipping is included. We sell them at cost or loss.<p>The platform subscription starts at $5 per worker (discounts available). So netting a company that tracks 100 workers nets you $2000 during 4 month period (5<i>100</i>4=2000).<p>Our clients are in Construction, Cleaning, Delivery, Hospitality, Real estate, Telecommunications, Transportation, Travel &amp;Tourism.<p>The main pain-point Textin addresses is temporary or outsourced workers, as it requires no additional equipment or training. The worker must use their own phone, and simply text (send as SMS) a 6-digit number they see with their own eyes to a number. All the manager must do, on the other hand, is simply enter the worker&#x27;s phone number and name to Textin dashboard.<p>Apply at info@textin.io","time":1425304362,"type":"comment"}
