We&#x27;ve found our product market fit and are now focused on execution - we&#x27;ve been redesigning and rewriting a series of applications to be highly performant and concurrent since we&#x27;re seeing significant volume now and trying to get ourselves ready for the next step.<p>Our product is a way for website owners to ditch banner ads in favor of native ads that will allow them to design their sites the way they want without having to worry about monetization from the beginning. When they are ready they include a bit of JavaScript and we will dynamically resize&#x2F;crop ads and leverage their existing HTML to make sure the ads provide a less disruptive experience.<p>Feel free to email me at dgoldin@triplelift.com with any questions!","time":1425223581,"type":"comment"}
