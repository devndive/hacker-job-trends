Email is over 40 years old and doesn’t support many modern use-cases. Most messaging alternatives aren’t decentralized or federated. We think there’s an opportunity to create a modern, federated messaging platform with mutable, collaborative objects being at the heart of it (i.e. tasks, events, etc -- but the objects could be anything). What would happen if you took the best components of email (IMAP&#x2F;SMTP), chat (IRC&#x2F;XMPP) and collaboration (Wave)... and created a federated platform and new set of open protocols around it? That’s what we’re building. Spatch is backed by some of the top US and European venture capital investors. Spatch is an equal opportunity employer.<p>We&#x27;d love to get to know you fellow HN&#x27;ers.
