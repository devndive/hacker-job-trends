We are in San Francisco and also open to remote candidates. Email us at jobs@dominodatalab.com.<p>Our customer base is growing fast and we need engineers to sustain an aggressive roadmap for the product. This is an excellent opportunity to join a company that has traction but is still small.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone with serious tech chops; our product is not a simple CRUD app. We have a desktop client, an asynchronous web app, job distribution, a custom revisioned file store, cluster management, and a dash of virtualized containers; heavy security and reliability requirements. Our stack is Scala (and Play), with MongoDB and some Javascript on the front end. Ideally we&#x27;d like someone who&#x27;s comfortable with these technologies, but great engineers who can quickly learn new technologies are also fine with us.","time":1425232839,"type":"comment"}
