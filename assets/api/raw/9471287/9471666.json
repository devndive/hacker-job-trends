We connect amazing people with founders and hiring managers at top startups.<p>We don’t charge placement fees because we’re not recruiters. We’re building technology to reduce the noise of the job search and match. We started Underdog.io because we experienced the pains associated with (1) hiring while working at top startups in NYC and (2) looking for new opportunities.<p>Our platform is currently live in NYC, where we work with 110 awesome startups. We’ve had to turn away one of every two companies that have tried to join the network.<p>As we scale, we’ll focus on building tools for candidates to organize, search, and discover new job opportunities. In our view of the future, job candidates don’t receive unsolicited outreach from recruiters and companies don’t pay placement fees for the vast majority of their hires. Job search is organized and talented candidates have more high-quality options.<p>We’re built with Python&#x2F;Flask, Javascript&#x2F;Node.js, PostgreSQL, Elastic Search, S3.<p>If you want to learn more about our first four months, here’s a blog post: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@joshuagoldstein&#x2F;our-first-four-months-building-underdog-io-904dd9831644\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@joshuagoldstein&#x2F;our-first-four-months-bu...</a>.<p>Email chris@underdog.io to apply.<p>Sorry, we can&#x27;t sponsor visa candidates.<p>Keywords: NYC, Developer, Dev, Python, Flask, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Elastic Search, S3, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.underdog.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.underdog.io&#x2F;</a>","time":1430491475,"type":"comment"}
