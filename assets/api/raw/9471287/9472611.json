Our last game is mobile (iOS, Android, etc.) but our next one is PC and console (PS4&#x2F;Xbox One).<p>We&#x27;re looking for a generalist programmer role. Mostly gameplay, but there&#x27;s all kinds of systems, UI, and AI to put together, as is the nature of a small team. We develop in Unity and C# so ideally we want someone who&#x27;s comfortable with that, but anyone who is smart and willing to learn is great too.","time":1430497714,"type":"comment"}
