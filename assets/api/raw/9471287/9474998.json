Our revolutionary urban logistics and on-demand delivery platform connects customers with local couriers, who purchase and deliver goods from any restaurant or store in a city.  With the largest on-demand delivery fleet in the country, we currently operate in 22 cities across the country and continue to expand each month.  We are well-funded by Spark Capital, Founders Fund, and Matrix Partners (full list below), and our Series B was raised earlier this year.  We also just announced major partnerships with Starbucks and Chipotle.","time":1430520585,"type":"comment"}
