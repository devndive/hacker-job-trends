Home lending is a $10 trillion vertical that hasn’t kept pace with technology, so we’re bringing banks and their customers the consumer-grade tools they deserve.<p>At Blend, top engineers and designers from Palantir, Google, Stanford, and Caltech have joined forces with industry experts to disrupt the archaic systems in use today. We&#x27;re founded by former Palantir engineers and backed by Peter Thiel, Andreessen Horowitz, and other prominent investors.<p>We&#x27;re a team of 38 and growing quickly. We care about helping people be productive, set a high bar for success, and focus on building a product with far-reaching impact. Of course, we also like to balance intense sprints with ping pong and scotch. We love sharing meals, brewing our own coffee, and working in our light and airy industrial office — along with dogs, motorcycles, and our eclectic mid-Market neighbors.<p>For more information, visit <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blendlabs.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blendlabs.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a>\nFeel free to reach out with any questions - sarah@blendlabs.com","time":1430512233,"type":"comment"}
