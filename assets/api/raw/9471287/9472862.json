The company culture is fantastic. The people are great to work with. The Boston office feels like a startup because it&#x27;s relatively small (40 people), yet we&#x27;re well-funded and secure. Everywhere I go people tell me they love our product or know someone who loves it and talks about it.<p>In Site Engineering, we&#x27;re using jQuery, Bootstrap, underscore, Handlebars, Backbone, Stylus, Buster, Selenium, requirejs, and Highcharts on the front end, with new technologies introduced as needed. We&#x27;re only using node as part of the build system for now. The back end is tomcat with a lot of Spring and Hibernate in front of mysql. Some big data projects I&#x27;m aware of also use Python. Beyond that, check job listings to know what tools might be used.","time":1430499514,"type":"comment"}
