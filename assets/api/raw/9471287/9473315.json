Not Silicon Valley.  Not even really tech.  But cool :)<p>GDC (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gothamdreamcars.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gothamdreamcars.com</a>) is an ultra-exotic car rental company.  I started it about 11 years ago and have built it organically to a multi-city company renting out some of the coolest cars on earth.<p>A few years ago I dove headfirst into the tech side of things, taught myself to code, and built our entire tech stack myself - and it now runs the whole company.  But I&#x27;m focused on other things these days and don&#x27;t have the time to maintain &#x2F; continue to develop the site, so it&#x27;s time to bring someone on board to handle it.<p>It&#x27;s not the most world-changing stuff -- essentially a CRUD app with a consumer-facing front-end and admin-facing back-end for managing the fleet, booking reservations, doing light CRM, billing, logistics, etc.  But it&#x27;s incredibly satisfying to work on -- every feature directly helps the employees in the office work more efficiently, helps the cars get booked more often, and helps our customers stay happy.  It&#x27;s step-by-step replacing manual processes and has a huge impact on the company, employees and customers.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for some satisfying part-time, remote Rails&#x2F;Frontend work and are interested in directly improving an interesting business that deals with Ferraris and Lamborghinis, this might be ideal for you.  There&#x27;s zero overhead here -- if you have an idea for a feature, you can go ahead code it up and push it live that day.<p>You don&#x27;t have to be a senior Rails or JavaScript expert - you just have to be better than I am ;) (I&#x27;m a solid intermediate.)<p>There&#x27;s a long list of fun features on my to-do list, so the first few weeks&#x2F;months would be more involved as you bang out updates and get things caught up, then it would transition to maintenance, new features, new ideas, etc. over time.<p>A bit about our stack and some of the tasks at hand:<p>* Rails (currently on 3.2, moving to 4.x)<p>* MongoDB (but that&#x27;s gotta go, so we&#x27;re moving to Postgres)<p>* Stylus for CSS<p>* Haml &#x2F; Slim for HTML templates<p>* JavaScript (currently mess of jQuery - TBD which framework we&#x27;ll move to)<p>* Git-based workflow<p>If this sounds interesting&#x2F;fun, take a look at the site, shoot me an email (contact info in HN profile) and we&#x27;ll discuss.","time":1430503233,"type":"comment"}
