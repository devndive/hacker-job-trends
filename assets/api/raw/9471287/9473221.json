We&#x27;ve found our product market fit and are growing quickly. I joined 18 months ago when we were 13 people are now over 50 and just moved into a new office space. We&#x27;re currently focused on scaling our tech so there are lot of opportunities to do interesting and challenging work.<p>Our core product is a native advertising ad exchange that allows publishers (website owners) to ditch banner ads in favor of native ads that will allow them to design their sites the way they want without having to worry about monetization from the beginning. When they are ready they include a bit of JavaScript and we will dynamically resize&#x2F;crop ads and leverage their existing HTML and CSS to make sure the ads fit with the look they&#x27;re going for.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of interesting work we&#x27;re doing with computer vision, high performance networking, as well as quantitative engineering to help build out our bidders.<p>Feel free to email me at dgoldin@triplelift.com with any questions!","time":1430502588,"type":"comment"}
