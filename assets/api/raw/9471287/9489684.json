Point&#x27;s first product lets homeowners &quot;sell&quot; fractional equity in their home. There are no monthly repayments -- instead, homeowners get a tax-deferred lump sum now and the investor “exits” when the homeowner sells the property.<p>We’re using Rails and will build services in Go as we scale. The ideal candidate is comfortable with back-end design + implementation, has the potential to be dangerous on the front-end, can build micro-services, and is thoughtful about product and design.<p>Andreessen Horowitz led our initial 3M seed in January; Bloomberg, Greylock, Ribbit Capital, SV Angel and a few others also participated. We&#x27;re super-early -- five folks as of last week -- and looking to build an exceptional team that wants to change how folks think about homeownership.
