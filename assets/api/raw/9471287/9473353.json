Right now we&#x27;re a small team, but we have many spots on our technology team to fill. It&#x27;s so early that we don&#x27;t have a great job site yet. Here&#x27;s a little bit of info about us:<p>Our Chief Digital Strategist, Teddy Goff, is from Obama 2008 &amp; 2012. Our CTO, Stephanie Hannon, is from Google. I worked Obama 2012 and more recently came from Optimizely to HFA as the Director of Frontend Engineering and Optimization.<p>If you haven&#x27;t worked on a campaign before, it is quite a unique experience. If you&#x27;re interested, email your resume to kylerrush at gmail dot com and let me know what kind of role you&#x27;re looking for!","time":1430503496,"type":"comment"}
