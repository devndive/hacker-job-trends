Full time.<p>I have recently taken up a role to build a payment network from scratch, out of Bangalore, India.\nIt is funded by a big corporation, but will be arms-distance from their central business.\nIt is a large, complex and fascinating problem to crack. The potential to bring banking to 600 million un&#x2F;underbanked Indians is what excited me to work on this.\nIn the past I have built both fast-data and big-data companies and have a few patents in this space.\nWe are looking to hire a good core team of full time math, physics and CS majors, who will work of Bangalore, India.\nIf you are interested, please email me at google&#x27;s email service - takenottie. Thanks for reading.","time":1430537491,"type":"comment"}
