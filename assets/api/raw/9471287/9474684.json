We have numerous mobile and web projects underway.  We&#x27;re looking for mobile engineers, data engineers, infrastructure engineers, front-end engineers - you name it.  Please check the listings here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;reddit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;reddit</a><p>reddit is #9 on the web (if you count page views) with 7B last month.  Ellen Pao is our CEO and Alexis Ohanian is back as Chairman.  We&#x27;re a small, diverse, close-knit team (around 70 people), that values collaboration and creativity.  We have unlimited vacation days, provide free breakfast and lunch (there is such a thing), and pay for things like the gym and your mobile phone bill. We recently raised $50M from Sam Altman (YCombinator), Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Peter Thiel, Ron Conway, and Snoop Dogg.","time":1430516250,"type":"comment"}
