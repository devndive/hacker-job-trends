We&#x27;ve been around since 2005 as myYearbook, rebranding in 2012 as MeetMe. We&#x27;ve launched other apps such as Focal, Choosy, Charm, and Unsaid in the past, and are looking to continue adding more standalone apps in the future.<p>We use a wide variety of languages, generally using what makes sense. C, PHP, Python, JavaScript and Node.js, and native iOS and Android development are the most common. MeetMe is a fun place to work. We hold a yearly developer retreat, as well as regular company-wide hackathons. We have a book club, board game club, and we even have a game room. And our summer hours last all year round.<p>While we aren&#x27;t a new company in the time scale of the internet, we still know how to have fun. We just get the benefit of not having to kill ourselves working 12 hour days. =) This means you&#x27;ll enjoy actually going home on time! We have many openings, both technical and non-technical. Here is a list of positions we are currently looking for:<p>* Senior Android Developer<p>* Senior iOS Developer<p>* Senior Database Administrator (PostgreSQL DBA)<p>You can apply directly here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobvite.com&#x2F;m?3SzvEgwl\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobvite.com&#x2F;m?3SzvEgwl</a><p>Or you can contact me at jlotito@meetme.com.
