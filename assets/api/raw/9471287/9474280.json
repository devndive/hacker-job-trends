Backstop is a Chicago based company that makes web-based software applications for hedge funds and the people who invest in them.  Over the last few years, we have grown considerably, won several awards, and built a lot of great software.  Backstoppers take our customers and our service very seriously, but pride ourselves on not taking ourselves too seriously in the process.<p>We&#x27;re looking for excellent, experienced software developers. Our technology stacks are heavy on the server side, Java and Rails-oriented, but that doesn&#x27;t stop us from using the right language or tool to solve a particular problem. We love using Ruby to drive the browser and API tests of our Java applications, building Fitnesse suites to organize our Scala-based integration tests, scripting data loaders in Python, and even hacking at, and in, Perl5 when we&#x27;re feeling retro.","time":1430511904,"type":"comment"}
