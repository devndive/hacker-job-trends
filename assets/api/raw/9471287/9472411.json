EDA software requires cross-disciplinary skills and knowledge related to the semiconductor packaging technology and the complex CAD tools used during the design process. In addition, manufacturing systems require skills in high-reliability distributed systems that perform compute intensive tasks across large server clusters. As a software engineer, you will work with a team on developing and supporting EDA tools and distributed systems in a fast-paced environment. We need our engineers to have a passion for learning new technologies and the drive to tackle new problems as we transform the electronic interconnect industry.<p>Our technical stack consists of Python and C&#x2F;C++ for high performance portions. These systems run in distributed configurations, both local high reliability clusters and cloud resources. Deca Technologies offers software engineers  a chance to apply their skills to a new field and learn a vast new domain.<p>Contact: craig.bishop@decatechnologies.com","time":1430496508,"type":"comment"}
