But, it’s not for applications, it’s for people.<p>Instead of apps storing people’s data, people bring their own personal database for apps to use.  That&#x27;s this database.<p>Apps can read and write data to it, and multiple apps can be connected to it simultaneously.<p>The owner of the database can disconnect it at any time, without losing their data, and finally use one set of data everywhere.<p>It’s a paradigm shift.  Once you open this door, tons of neat things are possible.<p>If this sounds interesting to you, please contact me.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.servant.co\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.servant.co</a>\nausten   @   servant.co","time":1430526761,"type":"comment"}
