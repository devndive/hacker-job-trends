We&#x27;ve been growing our service at an exponential rate for the past year, and our customers love us! We have a number of open positions, and have hired a significant portion of our team via Hacker News.<p>Rinse is hiring a senior Software Engineer to develop our functionality across the stack. We have hybrid mobile apps for both Android and iOS for our customers AND our drivers. We also have sophisticated web-based tools for our customer service team, internal operations staff, and vendors. Laundry is a surprisingly-complex logistical process, and so our customer-facing software is just the tip of the iceberg. We&#x27;re solving problems like the Traveling Salesman and image classification, too. Our tech stack is approximately HTML5 &#x2F; Backbone.js &#x2F; Django &#x2F; Python &#x2F; Postgres &#x2F; Heroku &#x2F; AWS &#x2F; Ubuntu, but we&#x27;re a tiny tech team, so any newcomer will be able to shape architecture.<p>We&#x27;d also be interested in taking on a summer intern if the right student is still looking for an internship.<p>Interested?
