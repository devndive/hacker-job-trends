World-class companies (Apple, Mercedes, Nordstrom to mention a few) use Medallia to create awesome customer experiences. Our platform is already used by hundreds of thousands of people every day, but we need your help to handle the next 10X of growth.<p>Dividing our codebase into independent micro-services will make it easier for new engineers to get up to speed, enable much faster deployments of new code (by the engineers themselves) and make it easier and cheaper to scale with much better resiliency.<p>Despite the popularity of micro-service architectures, and plethora of available frameworks, there are still many unsolved problems (especially around RPC performance, storage and freely moving processes around) in operating at scale in production. We not only want to solve these for ourselves, but share our findings and tools with the wider community.<p>We are using a blend of the best tech out there: Docker for containerization; Aurora&#x2F;Mesos for data center &#x2F; server management; CEPH for fully redundant storage and putting it together in a way we haven&#x27;t seen anyone else do. We held a tech talk about it at a recent Docker Meetup:<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.meetup.com&#x2F;Docker-Palo-Alto&#x2F;events&#x2F;221410784&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.meetup.com&#x2F;Docker-Palo-Alto&#x2F;events&#x2F;221410784&#x2F;</a><p>Please send me a note at kristian@medallia.com if any of the above sounds interesting to you.<p>Kristian Eide,\nSoftware Architect","time":1430506536,"type":"comment"}
