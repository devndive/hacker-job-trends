This is a unique opportunity to contribute to the core architecture of one of the web’s most innovative and exciting services. You’ll get to work on challenging technical problems alongside a small but driven group of developers, and play a key role in shaping both the product and team culture.<p>IFTTT’s mission is to help people to create connections between the services and devices they use every day. We’ve built a system that enables users to set up simple “if this, then that”-style recipes, which allow activity from one web service to trigger activity in another. The current system supports over 150 unique services and runs hundreds of millions of recipe-handling tasks per day, and we plan to dramatically expand on our flexibility and scalability. Under the hood, this translates to building a platform that can talk to and move data between virtually any API you can think of, all in realtime and at massive scale.<p>We&#x27;re well funded, and we work hard to do right by our employees. New hires at IFTTT enjoy competitive salary and equity, full benefits, and a flexible vacation policy. Much more than that, we offer interesting, deep projects and an amazing team experience. We operate on the philosophy that the best job perk is fantastic teammates, and to this end we’ve assembled a staff of intensely curious, well-rounded, talented people who happen to be great engineers. We’re hoping you can be the next one.<p>Visit <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ifttt.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ifttt.com&#x2F;jobs</a> for more information.","time":1430509704,"type":"comment"}
