If you&#x27;re, like me, bored by all the media sharing rails&#x2F;django&#x2F;express webapps out there and want to solve complex problems, like horizontally scaling a highly available backend service, shoot me an email at santi at saucelabs. We&#x27;re looking for SENIOR engineers with experience and interest in distributed systems. DevOps is a smaller part of what we do, but experience is a plus.<p>About Sauce:\nSauce Labs is a SAAS+E2E series C startup in the bay area. We provide an automated testing cloud service so other companies don&#x27;t have to build their own Selenium or Appium grids. We pride ourselves about our values and transparency (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saucelabs.com&#x2F;our-values\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saucelabs.com&#x2F;our-values</a>). Oh, and a nice to have these days: we have a real business model!<p>About the Team:\nOur CORE team is currently 8 people and we plan to grow in a controlled fashion this year, hiring only excellent people who are excited about what we do. Most of the team is in SF, with some members in EU working on a re-location. We build a highly available service that runs thousands of customer Selenium tests in real time using VMs hosted in our own infrastructure. We own all our hardware and we collaborate tightly with our Ops team to manage it.<p>About our Stack:\nSauce Labs runs on a Python + Twisted stack and we&#x27;re currently discussing technology changes to take it to the next level (Go is a clear option). We use KVM, LXC and VMWare for virtualization, MySQL, Redis, Ansible and other fine tools.","time":1430615709,"type":"comment"}
