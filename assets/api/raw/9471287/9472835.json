We just raised $50 million from Kleiner Perkins, and we&#x27;re working on allocating our fleet of drivers more efficiently. A few months ago the routing algorithm was &quot;pick the closest available driver by distance&quot;, so there&#x27;s definitely a lot of room for improvement.<p>We did just start logging the positions of every driver at the time of every pickup, and making guesses about how long it&#x27;s going to take. Hoping you can help us make the most of this and our other data.<p>We have a ton of other interesting optimization problems - how&#x2F;when to get pickups from drivers to the warehouse, how to optimize the warehouse, how to route packages to people once they are in our possession, etc.<p>Our founders are Canadian and we can help with visas. Any workstation setup you want, really generous healthcare and dental programs.<p>Also hiring for mobile engineering positions &amp; a warehouse engineering lead.
