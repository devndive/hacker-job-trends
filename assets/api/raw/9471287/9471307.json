ShareLaTeX is an online LaTeX editor with over 400,000 registered users, and DataJoy is our new app for online data analysis with Python and R. We&#x27;re aiming to make these technologies more accessible and easy to use for academics doing data analysis, numerical modelling and statistical analysis.<p>You should be comfortable quickly learning new technologies and enthusiastic about improving the efficiency of scientists and their tools. Our current technology stack involves Node.js, MongoDB, Redis, Coffeescript, Angular.js, and Docker, so experience in these is useful but not required. We’d rather see that you have demonstrable interest in the problems we are solving, and that you’ve created some great stuff in the past. We would love someone with front-end experience and a good sense of usability design, but we won&#x27;t discount people with more of a backend focus.<p>Some reasons you&#x27;d enjoy working for us:<p>* Around 80% of our codebase is open-source and we’re big fans of free software.<p>* We’re agile (with a lower case a). We test everything (unit and acceptance), we have a CI build process, a full staging environment to play with, and we automate as much as possible.<p>* We don’t expect you to have to fill up a 9-5, 40 hour work week. A work&#x2F;life balance is important and we don’t think programming is an activity that can be neatly time boxed.<p>* You can work fully remotely (in fact, you probably will). All founders and employees work remotely at the moment.<p>* We’re a bootstrapped company with no outside investors.<p>Send us an email: team@sharelatex.com","time":1430489096,"type":"comment"}
