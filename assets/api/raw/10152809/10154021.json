It&#x27;s pretty great, one example: every week you earn ~10 hours off.<p>We&#x27;re hoping you like the idea of making a difference with us. No ping pong, no rock band, and you go home at 5.\nTake the generous time off. Have the resources to experiment and reach your potential.\nFor the tool-builders doing keyword searches: sure, there&#x27;s a good amount of django, flask, and (py-)objective-c.\nBut we&#x27;re also getting the job done with puppet, munki, and autopkg. If you (or anybody you know) might be interested,\nplease reach out: @sacrilicious on twitter, Allister Banks on linkedin, Allister on macadmins Slack, and abanks@montefiore.org<p>(No recruiters or folks looking for freelance-type contracts, please)","time":1441127617,"type":"comment"}
