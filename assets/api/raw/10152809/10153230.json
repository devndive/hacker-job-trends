You must already be able to work in the U.S.<p>=For Solar Skeptics=<p>In the last few years, the solar industry reached &quot;grid parity&quot;, which means that the unsubsidized installed cost is now cheaper than buying power from the grid. That&#x27;s why this industry is the fastest growing industry in the country. This isn&#x27;t some subsidy-dependent industry anymore. We work hard and we make real money (while conveniently also saving the planet).","time":1441122704,"type":"comment"}
