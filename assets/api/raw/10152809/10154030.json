Our revolutionary urban logistics and on-demand delivery platform connects customers with local couriers, who purchase and deliver goods from any restaurant or store in a city. With the largest on-demand delivery fleet in the country, we currently operate in 30 cities across the country and the number of deliveries we do each year has grown 10x every year.
