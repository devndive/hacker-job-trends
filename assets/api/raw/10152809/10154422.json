We&#x27;re bringing modern, elegant software to a field that still relies on fax machines and manilla envelopes. We are bringing security, efficiency and joy to a paper-based pillar of the US economy.<p>The type of problems we&#x27;re tackling involve workflow, product design, and data. Rapid feature iteration? Oh, yeah! We do SaaS for non-technical users. Everyday, our clients call and email to say that we&#x27;re making them happy, and that feels great. However, in this industry, most people are unaware of what modern software is capable of. That means we must do research, gather data and talk to customers to inform each of our choices.<p>Snapdocs&#x27;s culture is one that trusts its team members to make smart decisions. This means we value both independent work as well as seeking collaboration. We&#x27;re becoming ubiquitous in one segment of the market and we&#x27;re looking to hire another core engineer to help us expand further.<p>More details: pivotal, git, rails 3&amp;4, Postgres, slack, opsworks, AWS, jquery, balsamiq, coffee (as in... you know... code fuel)<p>Send an email to jobs@snapdocs.com telling us about yourself.
