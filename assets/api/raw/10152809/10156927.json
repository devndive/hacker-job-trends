It’s amazing that nobody else is solving this problem with technology, or at scale, but we are. It turns out there’s a huge need; major retailers like Home Depot, Staples, Radioshack, Bed Bath and Beyond, and many others are really excited about our solutions that combine technology, data science, and warehouse logistics into a seamless solution that solves their problems and makes them more money.<p>We’re looking for Senior Mobile Developers to help us build native apps for warehouse management as well as consumer experiences for our e-commerce websites. Both Android and iOS. Totally greenfield for the e-commerce apps, and mostly so for the warehouse tools.<p>Remote is cool after awhile but we’re focused on building a strong team here in DC first, so expect to be here for a bit to start at least (6-12 mos).<p>Lots of great benefits and an amazing mission!
