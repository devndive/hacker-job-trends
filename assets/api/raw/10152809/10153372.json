We understand consumer scale and data (Reddit co-founder &amp; engineers) and aspire to build products that customers love.  We&#x27;ve had success due to this, consistently getting 4-5 star reviews on app&#x2F;play stores and net promoter scores at or above the best in the tech industry.<p>We&#x27;re friends and work hard to enable folks to do their best work.  Processes are light and trust is high. At 35 engineers we&#x27;re not so big where you can&#x27;t know everyone well and have an impact, but not so small where it&#x27;s chaos and you don&#x27;t have anyone to learn from.  We value learning and growth (and not having bored people) and invest regular time in doing so.  For example, every other Friday is open time for you to do stuff that helps you be a better engineer.<p>We&#x27;re looking for folks that love all of the above and will help us keep our standards high.
