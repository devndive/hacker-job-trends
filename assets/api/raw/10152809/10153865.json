Our system follows fundamental statistical principles under strict computational constraints while rigorously evaluating and benchmarking itself on a large, diverse collection of real-world data sets and applications. Building this type of mainstream platform requires close coordination among several research and engineering disciplines, each with crucial responsibilities.<p>We are looking for frontend, systems engineers and scientists. Strong foundations in probability, linear algebra, and optimization are a requirement. Preference on MS or PhD in Computer Science or equivalent degrees. If you feel you have a strong background in the above areas and  have an BS still feel free to apply!<p>Open positions can be found here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scaledinference.com&#x2F;jobs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scaledinference.com&#x2F;jobs.html</a><p>You can also email me if you have any questions or just want to chat ken[at]scaledinference.com","time":1441126689,"type":"comment"}
