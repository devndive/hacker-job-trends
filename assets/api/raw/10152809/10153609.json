Maybe you&#x27;re just the person Neonto needs to finish version 1.0 of our next-generation app design tool and take it to the next level.<p>The product, Neonto Studio, is a visual Mac-based creative environment for building mobile apps and interfaces. We want to enable designers to move beyond static mockups and limited HTML prototypes, into real native apps. Neonto Studio generates clean and lightweight iOS and Android code that can be easily used in a larger project or deployed to app stores.<p>From a technical point of view, this is a large-scale content creation app written in Cocoa. Currently there are code generation backends for iOS, Android &amp; Apple Watch. Actually we&#x27;re looking to revamp the code generation part of the software, so your input could make a crucial difference...<p>That&#x27;s the great part of working on a product like this: your contribution makes a visible difference and enables creative people to do something they just couldn&#x27;t do before. This could be your chance to make a mark on UI design workflows and the lives of designers everywhere!<p>Contact: jobs at neonto dot com","time":1441124954,"type":"comment"}
