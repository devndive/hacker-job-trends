We also have openings for Ux Designer and Ux Strategist positions, along with Project Managers. I come from the engineering side, so I will describe that better:<p>Willowtree is a small but fast growing company that works with the world biggest brands to build them the best possible mobile experience. I&#x27;ve been here 3 years and came from a stereotypical large inflexible software shop in a big city. In contrast Willowtree is strange and unusual in the best possible way:<p>1) Organized into small, fast teams, with extremely disciplined software development process. This is the place develop and perfect your ideal work process.<p>2) Located outside overcrowded metro areas (my commute to work is 10min!)<p>3) Has a crazy amount of trust in each employee so you get to own and drive the product you are working on, even visit clients and tell them how your work can solve all their problems :-)<p>4) Large variety of projects and cutting edge technology to explore or research (I shipped 9+ major apps I&#x27;m very proud of in past 3 years or so).<p>5) Contagious enthusiasm. This is what you get where everyone is on top of their game and doing their best work. If there are problems, they get quickly identified and fixed without too much ceremony.<p>If this is the type of place you&#x27;d enjoy working at take a closer look at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;willowtreeapps.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;willowtreeapps.com</a>","time":1441127746,"type":"comment"}
