We created a bacteria that eats sugar and produces acetaminophen -- the active ingredient of Tylenol. ps: This is the only living cell on the planet that produces acetaminophen.<p>20n is YCombinator, DARPA, and Khosla Ventures backed, with existing Fortune 500 customers and incoming revenue. Our core technology is a data mining and machine learning platform for biological data. We routinely distribute using Spark, write approximation algorithms for NP-complete problems, and push the software predictions to robots that build the microbes. We are looking for algorithms experts who want to see their predictions create new life!<p>Full job descriptions:<p>* Data mining and NLP: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;20n.com&#x2F;jobs.html#team:input\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;20n.com&#x2F;jobs.html#team:input</a><p>* Machine learning: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;20n.com&#x2F;jobs.html#team:predict\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;20n.com&#x2F;jobs.html#team:predict</a><p>* Computational Biology: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;20n.com&#x2F;jobs.html#team:sequence\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;20n.com&#x2F;jobs.html#team:sequence</a>","time":1441130025,"type":"comment"}
