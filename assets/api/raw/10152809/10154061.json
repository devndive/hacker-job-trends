Tech includes Ruby (Rails), React, Node, and Postgres running on AWS.<p>My personal opinions on why I like working here:<p>- Rails at scale is a fun challenge (~1400 universities and&#x2F;or school districts and often over 200k concurrent users)<p>- Strong engineering culture. We were founded and are still run by technologists which has a positive impact (open source commitment, addressing tech debt, quarterly hackathons, general openness)<p>More info at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;1MImhw5\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;1MImhw5</a> or email me at mnomitch(at)instructure(dot)com if you have questions and want to chat.","time":1441127834,"type":"comment"}
