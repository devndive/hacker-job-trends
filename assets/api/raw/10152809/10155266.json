Check the full job listings here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;americanpublicmedia.applicantpro.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;americanpublicmedia.applicantpro.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a><p>Our digital products team is divided into two groups: Software Engineers and Web Development. Software Engineers work on the backend CMS products and bigger infrastructure things that the internal users work with, and solve some gnarlier performance problems that come from having thousands of connected users streaming audio. Work is undergoing updating our decade old CMS to several newer rails-based CMS systems that are loosely coupled, provide coherent REST APIs and are indexed with modern search tools.<p>Web developers work on consuming internal and External APIs and building web products, often having a lot of influence on the end product&#x27;s design. (Note: There is a UX position in the works, yet to be posted.) Future work for the Web Development team is going to focus on moving more of our stack from server-side to client side. We believe radio&#x27;s core competency is the companionship and presence it offers, and we want our web products to augment that, which means more logged in and customized experiences that client-side tools like angular&#x2F;ember&#x2F;react excel at.<p>I&#x27;m leaving the company at the end of this week, but if you have any questions before then, email me at jheideman@mpr.org. Otherwise, apply through the listings online.","time":1441137511,"type":"comment"}
