Bend has a ton of outdoor stuff, is still pretty small, but is growing.  Compared to many other nice places, Bend is still very affordable (houses cost about half what they do in Boulder), and &#x27;human sized&#x27; - I have never driven to work since I got here!<p>G5 has a good engineering culture, nice people, and a bias towards clearly delineating work time and family&#x2F;outdoors&#x2F;beer&#x2F;whatever time so that we get to enjoy the place we live in.<p>The mountain biking in Bend is <i>awesome</i>!<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;getg5.atsondemand.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;getg5.atsondemand.com&#x2F;</a> lists the current openings.  In particular, in my department, a software engineer, and a senior test engineer (someone who can write code to drive browser tests).
