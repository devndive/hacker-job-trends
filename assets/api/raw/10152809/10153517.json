It got many great replies (including a number talking about how people&#x27;s friends had typically had 2-3 jobs in the time they&#x27;d been with us), but this one stood out:<p>&quot;A combination of an informal environment, freedom, and high expectations - I wanted a place where I could be myself and grow doing&#x2F;learning things that I was passionate about, while having lots of smart people around me to collaborate with in doing so. I came from a huge, strictly regimented and siloed company, and was fed up with being told &quot;that&#x27;s a great idea, but it&#x27;s not your job&quot;, and Distilled seemed to be the polar opposite.&quot;","time":1441124423,"type":"comment"}
