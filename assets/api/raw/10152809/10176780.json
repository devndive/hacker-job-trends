Some general experience doing traditional &#x27;graphic design&#x27; is also useful for the occasional thing that needs to be put together (like a logo for an MVP).<p>We&#x27;re also on the lookout for an awesome Node dev – some of our products are (relatively) boring CRUD-type applications (MEAN stack mostly) but we have some more interesting bits and pieces too in the realtime space (think slack meets trello), analytics (how do you build small questionnaires to produce meaningful ongoing measurement of employee satisfaction?) and trying to fix one of the web&#x27;s biggest problems: PDF forms.<p>We&#x27;re a little team and there are still a lot of things we need to work on internally, like formalising the ways that we work and roadmap products (an ongoing struggle), and I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts on your approach.<p>I&#x27;m (CEO&#x2F;MD) based out of Melbourne but our team is global (India, Philippines, Dominican Republic, Australia). A bit of overlap with our timezone (+10 GMT) is necessary, but you don&#x27;t have to work 9-5 local – that&#x27;s crazy.<p>Get in touch through email, addresses below. Individuals please, I prefer to work with people directly, not businesses&#x2F;recruiters etc.<p>hugh + design @ dialoguegroup dot com dot au – design position<p>hugh + node @ dialoguegroup dot com dot au – Node position","time":1441511614,"type":"comment"}
