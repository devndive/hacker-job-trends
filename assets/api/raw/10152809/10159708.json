We build and launch small remote-sensing &quot;cubesats&quot; to capture valuable data from the earth which we then offer to companies (AIS tracking and Maritime domain awareness, weather&#x2F;climate, etc.).<p>On June 30th we announced our $40M series B led by Promus Ventures with participation from Bessemer Venture Partners (Skybox). This additional capital will help fuel our growth as we expand and advance the capabilities of our technology, and work to launch our first constellation of 20 cubesats by late 2015.<p>We are a fast moving, energetic start-up applying agile development principles to a traditionally sluggish and overly-burdened industry (and having fun doing it).\nYou will never be bored at Spire!<p>Please email Darin@spire.com if you are interested in learning more.
