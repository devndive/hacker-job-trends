Our mission is to build an automated system that disrupts the $170bn US freight industry by connecting large international business directly with long-haul truck drivers on their smartphone. 10 years from now, we will be the leading global logistics company. What started with smartphones and intelligent algorithms will eventually lead to an automated fleet of self-driving trucks.<p>Initially started by two Stanford alums in 2014, Dispatcher has since grown to 7 employees. We are located in the heart of SOMA in San Francisco. We went through Stanford&#x27;s StartX accelerator and subsequently raised $1.6 million from two leading seed funds in Silicon Valley as well as Stanford University.<p>The Stack<p><pre><code>  Backend: Microservices oriented architecture built on nodejs, rabbitmq, mongo, Firebase and R Stats\n  Web-Frontend: AngularJs, Pusher\n  Mobile App: Cordova based HybridMobileApp\n  Deployment: AWS, CircleCI, Saltstack\n  What gives you peace at night: Splunk, Sentry, PagerDuty\n\n</code></pre>\nFor internationals:<p><pre><code>  We are very open to working together with talented engineers who don&#x27;t reside in the US yet.
