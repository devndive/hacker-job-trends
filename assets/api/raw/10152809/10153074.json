Every one&#x27;s revolutioneyesing educaton but while some student&#x27;s cant even right the write words.<p>Then there was NoRedInk.<p>NoRedInk helps students quickly improve their grammar and writing skills. We&#x27;ve got a small, technically excellent engineering team. We extensively use React.js and Flux in production, as well as the compile-to-JS language Elm.<p>I work here because I get to learn about my practice (as well as my failing grammar skills) every day. I work here because I care about education. I work here because existing online tools for teaching grammar and writing are pathetic. Join us as engineer #9, and improve how grammar is taught.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;jobs</a><p>p.s.
