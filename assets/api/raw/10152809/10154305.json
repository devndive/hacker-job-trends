We run crowd-funding campaigns, develop open-source software, and train journalists to use digital security tools.<p>Our flagship product is SecureDrop, a secure platform for journalists, activists, or anyone interested in communicating with anonymous sources. SecureDrop is currently in use at approximately twenty news organizations worldwide, including The New Yorker, Washington Post, The Guardian, The Intercept, and ProPublica.<p>SecureDrop is a project that tackles unusually hard (but interesting!) security and usability problems. We&#x27;re looking for an engineer to help us improve the usability of SecureDrop for journalists, particularly the airgapped workflow for processing submissions. If you&#x27;re the kind of person who believes usability is essential for security, and think this sounds like an interesting problem, please get in touch!<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freedom.press&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;software-engineer-securedrop\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freedom.press&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;software-engineer-securedrop</a>","time":1441129528,"type":"comment"}
