By combining these tools, we’re replacing cumbersome and expensive business processes that are currently handled by a hodge-podge of spreadsheets, aging competitors, and repetitive human tasks.<p>Our large Rails and JS codebase is pleasant and habitable due to our focus on well-tested code and continuous refactoring and improvements. Every Mavenlink engineer majors in code and minors in product; we all love working through data designs as well as complex user interactions. Whether its through pair-programming, flexible roles, or our obsession for quality, well-tested code, our engineers (from grasshopper to black belt) are always learning.<p>Did we mention that Mavenlink is an awesome place to work? You’ll have the opportunity to work in a fast-paced, energetic environment with a smart team that loves what they do. A fully stocked kitchen, ping pong table, and hackathons are just a few of the perks.","time":1441143926,"type":"comment"}
