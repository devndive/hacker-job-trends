Here are some things I&#x27;ve done since then:\n- Learned a ton about how payment processing works under the hood\n- Used Twilio to add functionality to our phone system so our CS friends have a lower call volume\n- Gotten coffee&#x2F;lunch with pretty much everyone on the team (we&#x27;re still small)\n- Increased gif &#x2F; screencap usage in PRs &amp; code reviews\n- Automated transaction auditing, saving lots of person-hours &amp;&amp; increased test coverage\n- Helped translate fast-speaking Spanish on a few CS calls\n- Observed how a nimble startup implements Grown-Up-Business-Level security\n- Finally actually learned what ruby&#x27;s #inject method is all about\n- Had a real reason to consult POODR\nWe&#x27;re looking for nice people who have worked on hairy, wacky production full-stack code before - someone who can make things better without being rude, judgemental or arrogant about it. We&#x27;d prefer session musicians over rockstars.\nEmail jobs@truelinkfinancial.com and we&#x27;ll get back to you within 2 business days, pinky swear!\nkeywords for you CMD+F types (not requirements) - rails, RoR, ruby, fintech, full-stack, chinchillas","time":1441143605,"type":"comment"}
