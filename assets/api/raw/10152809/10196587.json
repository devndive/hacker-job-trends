We are well-funded and have traction in our country. Most of the brick and mortar businesses are integrated with us, and have large banks as partners.<p>Technology-wise we use simple and straight-forward frameworks and tools as dropwizard, hibernate, postgresql for internal and external APIs. JRuby and Rails for web portals and internal tools. We consume and provide a lot of APIs that come in all forms and shapes from soap, rest, files sent over FTP, etc.<p>You have strong skills in Java 7 or 8, write solid, robust and well-tested code. You are not afraid to jump into legacy code and refactor it if necessary. You prefer boring technology over the shiny new, and your implementation typically simplest way that works. At the current stage of the company you need to be self-motivated and find the work by yourself. Ideally you are also comfortable with Ruby.<p>We give you great flexibility when, how much and where you work. Timezones however should be European or Asian, at least in the beginning. You should commit to at least 3 days per week. Unfortunately we cannot afford silicon valley rates.<p>Contact: seb@cloudxls.com (my personal email)","time":1441870390,"type":"comment"}
