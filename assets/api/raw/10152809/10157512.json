Since then, we’ve been striving to enhance the security, and reduce the cost and pain points of money transfer. Our first solution allows users to complete a transfer in three easy steps and pay with any US debit card, with a nationwide cash solution coming soon. Receivers in Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala, El Salvador and Dominican Republic can collect the transfers in cash or receive the money directly into a bank account. Through every product iteration, we’ll continue to offer more convenience and meaningfully improve the user experience. Pangea is currently accepting transfers from limited states (AL, ID, IL, GA, MS, MT, NM, OR and SC) in the US.<p>Positions available<p>- Backend Engineer (NET&#x2F;C#)<p>- Android Engineer (Java)<p>- iOS Engineer (Objective-C&#x2F;Swift)<p>- QA Analyst<p>Full jobs list located at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gopangea.com&#x2F;jobs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gopangea.com&#x2F;jobs.html</a>","time":1441169896,"type":"comment"}
