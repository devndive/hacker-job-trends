We have billions of entities, hundreds of billions of facts, an amazing presentation layer, and a growing distribution network of top tier publishers. Everyone needs knowledge (we have close to 200M citations a month), and we’re here to satisfy that need.<p>What’s next: we’ve built an amazing product architecture that leverages our expansive knowledge graph. The next step is to become a dominant force in the growing knowledge industry. I&#x27;d love to talk to anyone working or interested in this exciting space. Unsolicited outreach is strongly encouraged! (ivan -at- graphiq.com)<p>About the team: The challenge of scaling human organizations is not unlike the task of scaling a technology stack. Just as large monolithic software applications tend to become ineffective and fail, a highly scalable engineering organization can&#x27;t be dependent on hierarchy. Developers, designers, and data analysts can form small, cross-functional, mission-oriented teams that are able to operate decoupled of one another (Bezo&#x27;s 2PT). Besides yielding more effective results, this distributed systems approach to human organizations promotes a happier, more harmonious engineering culture.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphiq.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;explore-opportunities\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphiq.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;explore-opportunities</a>","time":1441125092,"type":"comment"}
