Founded by two Thiel Fellows, REX just closed its seed round. Competitive salary offering and equity will be offered as we are now hiring our first ~5 engineers, with three positions listed below. We&#x27;re looking for people who are excited about the possibilities of new semiconductor startups, processor architectures and making the worlds best chip, and the positions below are not all encompassing... if you are interested in revolutionizing the semiconductor space, and excited about making a completely new processor from the ground up (with the full resources to go and do so), please send an email to thomas [at] rexcomputing.com !<p>Feel free to ask any other questions here! Our website is relatively vague, but I&#x27;m happy to answer most questions here, and a lot more over coffee or a phone call! Also note that the titles are not final, and as we are building a team from scratch, our early engineers will be forming the company around them.<p>Some articles on REX: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;539416&#x2F;startup-attempts-to-reinvent-the-cpu-to-make-computers-less-power-hungry&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;539416&#x2F;startup-attempts...</a><p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fortune.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;07&#x2F;21&#x2F;rex-computing&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fortune.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;07&#x2F;21&#x2F;rex-computing&#x2F;</a><p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theplatform.net&#x2F;2015&#x2F;07&#x2F;22&#x2F;supercomputer-chip-startup-scores-funding-darpa-contract&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theplatform.net&#x2F;2015&#x2F;07&#x2F;22&#x2F;supercomputer-chip-sta...</a><p>REX Computing | Compiler Developer | San Francisco Bay Area | On site ; Remote] | Full Time | Citizen | LLVM ; Compilers ; Backend<p>REX Computing | RTL&#x2F;Verilog Engineer | San Francisco Bay Area | On site ; Remote] | Full Time | RTL ; Verilog ; VHDL ; Chisel ; ASIC ; FPGA<p>REX Computing | VLSI&#x2F;Digital Chip Design Engineer | San Francisco Bay Area | On site ; Remote] | Full Time | FPGA ; ASIC ; Synopsys ; Cadence<p>metafriendly","time":1441121820,"type":"comment"}
