Basically, we work with the massive amount of location-based data sources out there to help businesses find the best place to open a new location.<p>We&#x27;re a young startup (less than a year old), but now that we have seed funding, we&#x27;re looking to scale up our business. Weâ€™re building out a large mapping tool to help our customers visualize and interact with our data, and we need a hotshot front-end dev to help.  Since we&#x27;re so early in our development, there&#x27;s a lot of room to help us work out the architecture, and make a big impact in how our business works.<p>We would love to find a developer who has at least some experience with UI and UX design. We find that understanding the user experience and flow is very helpful to being able to code the interaction in a way that makes sense to the user.  Pixel-level design skills are also very helpful.  That said, we expect you to be able to do the following:<p>* Code in Javascript on one of the popular frameworks (AngularJS, ReactJS, Vue.js)<p>* Build interactive UIs utilizing real-time data from internal and external REST APIs<p>* Interact with the Google Maps API<p>* Build responsive templates in HTML5 and CSS3 (knowledge of Sass is a big plus)<p>* Work with a team within a shared Git repo - i.e., you should know how to merge your code and not screw everything up<p>Send us an email at work@idealspot.com if you&#x27;re interested. Feel free to include any past work you can show us, such as a GitHub profile.","time":1441142065,"type":"comment"}
