We can lower both the first and second derivative of the rising health care cost curve, nationwide. There&#x27;s some compelling evidence we can do so, if you&#x27;d like to chat.<p>The company just under a year and half old but growing very rapidly. We punch well above our weight-class with experienced founders, ~100 team members (~ one quarter is engineering), and paying customers.<p>We&#x27;ve got a ton of interesting problems to solve around distributed systems, data analytics and predictions, complex data modeling, ultra high-availability, security, privacy and more. We&#x27;re currently looking for experienced SW engineers up and down the stack, back end, infrastructure, data, dev ops, test, generalist, etc.<p>Our tech stack is a mix of Go and Java components with Angular on the front end. We use a custom service bus to tie our SOA together, microservices style. We love Docker, CoreOS, postgres, riak, automated testing, and continuos integration.<p>As a company, we&#x27;re strong believers in transparency, trust and balance. As an engineering team, we believe good code is easy to read and should have a short &quot;time to understanding&quot;. We expect all of our engineers to continually teach as well as learn. We also believe that everyone should write good code, yet balance that against the need to ship.<p>All open jobs: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;8f7q15\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;8f7q15</a><p>If you are non-technical, but are interested in experiencing a hyper-growth startup, we also are hiring for operations, business development and other roles as well.<p>We&#x27;re super proud of the company mission, engineering culture and tech stack we&#x27;ve put together and would love a chance to explain it all in detail!","time":1441123813,"type":"comment"}
