Our goal is to automate every part of the legal profession that doesn&#x27;t require human legal judgment.<p>Our team already includes some of the best and brightest out there, including the youngest-ever Harvard Law graduate, a YC alum, and the former CIO of Sonic Foundry.<p>Shoot us an email if you are looking for important societal problems and great challenges, including using machine learning to categorize legal evidence (starting in the coming months). Eventually we want to be the Google of private data.<p>Our engineering stack is .NET&#x2F;RavenDB&#x2F;Lucene, with a heavy javascript front end. If you are are great at whatever you work with, we want to talk to you, but we especially need those with experience in our stack (or front-end), or with file-type processing (extracting images and text of the files) or pdf.js. We are also looking for QA engineers - but again, if you are exceptional at whatever you do, we want to at least have a conversation!<p>We just raised $10M from Bessemer (and were profitable before we took funding), so we are around for the long haul.<p>Email me directly at gabe@csdisco.com with a short note about why you would be a good fit for Disco!<p>More on Disco and our team here: <a href=\"http://csdisco.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;csdisco.com</a><p>Thanks for reading!","time":1417450537,"type":"comment"}
