We have an existing product that brings in revenue and still has some legs, but our main focus is on a new platform that exists as a virtual appliance (Linux VM) and is composed of (mostly) Erlang and JavaScript... with some Java and Python thrown in there. We sell to the Enterprise (banks, hosting providers, anybody with lots of VMs) and have strong leadership with experience from security, Intelligence orgs, HP, and others; but we still feel like a small company and are a good place for anyone looking to do difficult work on big problems in an environment where results are the only thing that matters.<p>Funded, profitable, and moving quickly; this is the best job I&#x27;ve ever had, and we have a very exciting roadmap ahead of us. If you like independence, Linux, Virtualization, and working with smart people, let us know.<p>All the usuals, casual dress, beer Fridays, flexible hours, etc... we&#x27;re not a &quot;cushy&quot; startup with ping-pong tables and company outings and all that. Ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that... we&#x27;re hustling way too hard, but as we grow I&#x27;m sure all that will change. Come here if you want to work really hard to get a product into the market, because there&#x27;s lots of really hard work to be done around these parts.","time":1417459067,"type":"comment"}
