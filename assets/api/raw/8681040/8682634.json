We value automated testing, readable&#x2F;maintainable code, documentation, and code reviews. We run in 2 week sprints and dedicate about 20% of total capacity to things the dev team thinks are important (technical debt, refactors, exploring a new technology, etc), while the rest goes to feature development and addressing bugs.\nWe are well capitalized with investments from Bessemer Venture Partners [0] and private investors.<p>== Current positions ==<p>- Full stack NodeJS&#x2F;Javascript developer.
