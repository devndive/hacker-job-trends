Tasks will include improving existing components and creating new systems for scaling, automating and monitoring of processes. Knowledge of Perl &amp; Bash is expected, however if you’re more comfortable with another dynamic language like Python or Ruby and have a good grasp of low level Linux, we should still talk. Familiarity with C would also be an advantage.<p>If you&#x27;re at all interested in this area and Helsinki as a place to live and work, drop a one line email with a link to your LinkedIn or GitHub profile to careers-hl@omniata.com","time":1417530973,"type":"comment"}
