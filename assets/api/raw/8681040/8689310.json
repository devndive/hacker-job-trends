You’ll be responsible for building our mobile app from scratch, working closely with me on the design and with our web engineer on the backend. Prior experience building an iOS app is required.<p>* Full-stack Web Engineer. You’ll be taking over the core engineering of the site from me, scaling it as we grow and implementing major new features. You need to be comfortable with Python, HTML and CSS. Bonus points if you have an interest in design.<p>StoryWorth makes it easy for people to privately record their family stories. Each week, we email our customers a question about their life, for example “What do you remember about your grandmother?” or “Tell me about the day you got engaged”. All they have to do is reply with a story, either by email or by phone. We save their stories and share them privately with their family.<p>We have a launched product with paying customers across the country who love our service. You&#x27;re a good fit for these roles if you crave a ton of responsibility on a small team. If you&#x27;re the kind of person who learns by doing, you&#x27;ll be learning faster than ever before. Both roles require 3-5 years of experience.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, I&#x27;d be happy to tell you more. Email your resume&#x2F;linkedin&#x2F;github profile to nick@storyworth.com, I can&#x27;t wait to hear from you!","time":1417549058,"type":"comment"}
