Software Engineers, particularly anyone interested in building (i) entirely new, large-scale distributed data services for scientific computing (we use Clojure); and (ii) web applications (Clojure, Rails, Python, Javascript, and iOS) used by farmers to manage weather risk.<p>2. Quantitative researchers in statistics&#x2F;ML, stochastic optimization, remote sensing, atmospheric physics, and agronomics. Our goal is to forecast statistical distributions of crop yield for any piece of arable land, synthesizing satellite images, digital elevation models, weather data, agricultural statistics, and geological surveys into multiscale models that underly our data services.<p>3. Experienced technical team leads, operations engineers, product managers, and designers to pull all this together into a compelling product. The scale and interdisciplinary nature of the work drive a lot of cross-collaboration within the company, supported by a pressing need to build durable solutions to some very hard and important problems.<p><pre><code>   ===========================    \n   ====== Why I love it ======    \n   ===========================\n\n – I think Climate is poised to make a huge impact on farming. \n – I am surrounded by a group of super smart people that care about the work we are doing.\n – I get to tackle challenging problems everyday.\n</code></pre>\nI am on the satellite imagery team and I am really excited about the work we&#x27;ve been doing, I am happy to talk in length about it over email at skhalsa@climate.com.<p><pre><code>   ===========================    \n   ====== Other details ======    \n   ===========================\n</code></pre>\n– Competitive salary \n– Excellent benefits \n– Stocks \n– Other crazy perks (massages!)<p>We also have something called sprintbatticals where anyone can work on an independent project for some time (we are in the midst of redesigning this)<p>If you apply through this link then I&#x27;m told you will be put in a smaller queue that should be looked at more quickly: <a href=\"https://hire.jobvite.com/j?bj=oVwpZfwz&amp;s=Hackernews_Satshabad_Khalsa\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hire.jobvite.com&#x2F;j?bj=oVwpZfwz&amp;s=Hackernews_Satshaba...</a><p>If you have any questions email at skhalsa@climate.com.
