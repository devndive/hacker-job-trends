But we&#x27;re also still pretty small on the engineering team, and everyone gets their hands dirty and makes a real impact.<p>Some info on tech:\nWe write mostly Java. Hadoop, Cassandra, Mongo, and Kafka are big parts of our stack, and we&#x27;re always looking for new tech that helps us work at scale. Experience with these is a big plus, but if you&#x27;ve never used them before that&#x27;s fine too, if you&#x27;re eager to learn.<p>Some info on culture:\nWe play Ultimate or Soccer on Fridays, we have a company band, we work sane hours, we don&#x27;t track vacation (and not in the &#x27;so nobody ever takes any&#x27; sense), and we Get Stuff Done. You&#x27;ll learn a lot from working here, regardless of your current level of experience. You&#x27;ll work directly with a world-class data science team (winners of multiple KDD Best Paper and other awards) that keeps us on the cutting edge of learning at scale, allowing us to build customer-specific models from billions of events per day.<p>If you write clean, working code, think through problems, and deliver on time, we want to talk to you.
