Change the world. Have fun. Do something important.<p>Smarterer gives people unprecedented understanding of what they know and what their teams and organizations know.<p>We are looking for creative web programmers, developers and hackers to join our product team. Ideally you are a versatile technologist who loves to build web products, especially (but not exclusively) if you have Python experience. Our stack is primarily Python, SqlAlchemy, Backbone and CoffeeScript.<p>Smarterer is doing something unique and important. We&#x27;re approaching a point where traditional university credentialing isn&#x27;t enough. Skills are changing too quickly and what makes someone effective in a role or job is evolving. New roles appear daily that no (or few) traditional universities have courses for. People are acquiring more and more skills through non-traditional means. Companies are finding it increasingly difficult to close the &quot;skills gap&quot;.<p>How do you show what you know?<p>Smarterer has created an innovative, machine learning, crowd-sourced testing system that will disrupt how people think about skills. Donâ€™t let our name fool you, while our system is fun, our unique, patent-pending, technology is also deeply rooted in scientific modern testing theory.<p>Smarterer is enabling a revolution: in how the enterprise manages their teams and talent, in the changing job marketplace, and in the way people measure their own skills and share that knowledge.<p>We were recently acquired by Pluralsight (<a href=\"http://pluralsight.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pluralsight.com</a>)! <a href=\"http://blog.smarterer.com/pluralsight-acquisition/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.smarterer.com&#x2F;pluralsight-acquisition&#x2F;</a> Still driving to the same vision but now with a partner that really gets it!<p>Interested?
