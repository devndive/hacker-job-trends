Through every product iteration, we’ll continue to offer more convenience and meaningfully improve the user experience. Pangea is currently in beta accepting transfers from limited states (AL, ID, IL, GA, MS, MT, NM and SC) in the US to anywhere in Mexico.<p>Our Stack: AWS, MySQL, AngularJS, .NET&#x2F;C#, RabbitMQ, Redis.
