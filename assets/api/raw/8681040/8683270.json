Our property owners don&#x27;t have to worry about responding to guest inquiries, key exchanges, cleaning, sheets&#x2F;towels&#x2F;laundry, or adjusting their nightly prices. We are an all-in-one solution for owners with second homes or vacation properties. In turn, our guests get a predictable hotel-like experience and a reliable concierge while they stay in the properties we manage.<p>There are plenty of challenges we work on every day. Our business depends on an on-the-ground workforce so we spend a lot of time building reliable applications for our vendors (cleaners, laundry partners, neighborhood managers). Because we answer all the inquiries for our owners, it is important we know a lot about the properties we represent. We try to get as much information about a property as possible and make getting that information seamless. Our owners are very patient with us now, but we need to build smarter systems to gather this data.<p>jobs@airenvy.com","time":1417463408,"type":"comment"}
