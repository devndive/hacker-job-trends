As we transition to a brand new dev team we&#x27;ll be doing a bunch of work in support of the collegeabacus.org app, basically building the entire dev ops stack, as well as other feature building. (We are building a big admin tool in angular.)<p>As an innovation office we will also be developing various alpha products and refining the current UX for ECMC&#x27;s users.<p>The work should offer a nice combination of challenges- some greenfield projects, (hopefully in node.js, or whatever we decide is most suitable) and some fun stuff to do in terms of startup dev (scaling) but none of the problems (user aquisition, runway).<p>We&#x27;re looking for web dev generalists who have experience with more backend and dev ops type skills or angular and CSS type skills. Smart people without relevant experience will also be considered. No visas, unfortunately.<p>We run a small lean dev team (not &gt; than 7 anytime soon) that will employ modern, sane dev practices: continuous integration, BDD, pairing. Diversity of background and experience is encouraged- I myself am a non-CS programmer. Work week will be a consistent 40 hours.<p>Drop me a message to my profile email if interested!","time":1417444858,"type":"comment"}
