Thumbtack&#x27;s audacious dream is to do what eBay and Amazon did for the consumer retail economy, but for the consumer services economy -- an estimated $800B domestic market.<p>We value code with integrity, an earnest engagement with scaling the product challenges we face, and a commitment to humility in the face of an ever-changing market landscape. We code in Go, Python, and PHP. We&#x27;re backed by great investors from Google Capital and Sequoia.<p>Our office is in SoMa, SF: beautiful hardwood floors, natural light, roof deck, and an easy commute from almost anywhere. Our chefs Aubrey and Ben source food from around the Bay Area and cook fresh lunches and dinners daily. We like board games and beer brewing, and sometimes we build robots on the weekends.<p>We&#x27;re hiring for data scientist, software software engineer, site reliability engineer, iOS engineer, and summer interns.<p>H1-B visa and interns welcome.<p>Let me know if you&#x27;d like to learn more.<p>chris @ thumbtack.com<p><a href=\"http://www.thumbtack.com/engineering\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thumbtack.com&#x2F;engineering</a><p><a href=\"http://www.thumbtack.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thumbtack.com&#x2F;jobs</a>","time":1417496007,"type":"comment"}
