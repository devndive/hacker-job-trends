We&#x27;re looking to hire senior software developers and software designers at our office in Grand Rapids.<p>A little bit about us:<p><pre><code>  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US.\n\n  - We aren&#x27;t limited to any really specific set of technologies, which is a great\n    opportunity to learn. In the past year, I&#x27;ve worked with Python, Objective-C\n    (and Swift), Backbone.js (inside PhoneGap), Angular.js, QT, Node.js, and\n    of course Ruby.\n\n  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,\n    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and &gt; 40 hour weeks are\n    rare by design.\n\n  - We&#x27;re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.\n\n  - We offer competitive salaries, health&#x2F;vision&#x2F;dental insurance, quarterly profit\n    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office\n    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.\n\n  - We run a makerspace in our building (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grmakers.com), which gives us\n    access to lots of cool stuff like a laser cutter and 3D printers.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about Grand Rapids:<p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.\n\n  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in\n    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a “World Class” bar on BA.\n    Just look here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;beeradvocate.com&#x2F;beerfly&#x2F;city&#x2F;43\n\n  - Low cost of living. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment\n    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.\n\n  - A growing technology and startup community.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love making software, and you have a couple of years of experience doing it.\n\n  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not\n    afraid to use more. You have some experience with web or mobile technologies.\n\n  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.\n\n  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m a software developer on this awesome team.
