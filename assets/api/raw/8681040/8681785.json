This platform enables engineers to perform detailed, fully-3D analysis of large-scale complex systems in seconds, which eliminates a major pain point across a wide range of engineering disciplines.<p>We currently have major engineering firms from the mining and power systems industries as customers.<p>We have offices in Boston, Lausanne and Ho Chi Minh City. Working remotely is a possibility.<p>-------------------------<p>Send job inquiries to: jobs@akselos.com (or contact me directly at david.knezevic@akselos.com)<p>We&#x27;re primarily looking for a Python developer to assist with our GUI development. The GUI is written in Python (Qt bindings) and allows users to create 3D models, send simulation requests to our cloud-based back-end and then render the results locally.
