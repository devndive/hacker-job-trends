Our current engineering team is small which means everyone has a very strong influence on the product and everyone makes a difference.  On the cultural side, we have a very open and collaborative environment.  Weekly grocery deliveries to our full kitchen and free lunch every two weeks.<p>We use Java, Tomcat, Maven, Spring, Hibernate, PostgreSQL, and have too many Linux servers to count.  If big data and web applications are your thing, we're the place with almost 100TB of data and taking in over 100GB per day.<p>Any questions or resumes, send to gflynn &#60;at&#62; crimsonhexagon.com \nAnd we do read these, I was hired through the \"Who's Hiring\" thread from May.<p>Thanks!","time":1346517323,"type":"comment"}
