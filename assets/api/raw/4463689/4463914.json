We have a solid system and a rapidly growing base of customers who love our product.<p>We have a fun team, great benefits, and an enjoyable workplace. Our approach is analytics-driven and we're working towards Continuous Integration.<p>I do primarily JavaScript, so I can mention a couple of the recent changes: we now use a node.js powered build system for our JS files, pre-compiled handlebars templates for client-side rendering, and we use feature detection to only load on browsers with localStorage and CORS support. (This works out to IE 8 and newer on the MS side.)<p>See more info at <a href=\"http://www.sociablelabs.com/careers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sociablelabs.com/careers/</a> or email nathan @ [company site] if you're curious about anything.<p>Sociable Labs also hosts the Tipp JS meetup, so if you're in the Dayton OH area, please stop by even if you're not interested in working with us! <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/tipp-js\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.meetup.com/tipp-js</a>","time":1346512465,"type":"comment"}
