Utilities achieve these energy savings by outsourcing these programs to consulting companies armed with Excel spreadsheets and filing cabinets, meaning that the programs don't always work as effectively as they could, and making it difficult to measure a program's effectiveness in a timely manner.<p>EnergySavvy is the data collection and analysis platform for these energy efficiency programs. Through great software and user experiences, we make programs run better, collect clean and consistent data and let our customers optimize their programs in real-time.<p>We're hiring backend Python devs, front-end devs, PMs, etc. Here's our jobs page:<p><a href=\"http://www.energysavvy.com/jobs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.energysavvy.com/jobs/</a><p>We're also currently offering a $13,000 referral bonus to anyone who refers a dev/PM that we hire!
