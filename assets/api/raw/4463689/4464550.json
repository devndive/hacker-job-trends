I have a position open that I think would be a great fit for a reader of Hacker News.  It is for a coder with business sense who will be in charge of nearly all technical aspects of running one of the largest websites in the DC area.<p>This position would be great experience for a person interested in someday launching their own online business.  You would work on nearly all technical aspects of running a large website, and work with me in launching new features.  While we need to work closely together, you can work from home much of the time. (I highly prefer somebody who lives in the Washington, DC area.)  Weâ€™ve been around 12 years so we aren't exactly a startup anymore. While there are no stock options, one advantage is that we have sane working hours.<p>Requirements:\n - Ability to code and an interest in creating and running excellent websites.\n - Not religiously opposed to working mostly with C#, JavaScript and MySQL.\n - An interest in or knowledge of foreign languages is a plus.\n - Serious web development experience is a plus.<p>If this sounds like something that you would be interested in, write me through jobs@[our domain name] and I (the founder) will be in touch.","time":1346523102,"type":"comment"}
