{"by":"chriszf","id":4467589,"parent":4463689,"text":"San Francisco: Fulltime<p>Do you like talking about code as much as you like writing code? Hackbright Academy is looking for instructors for our ten week code school. We teach a blend of practical engineering skills and computer science theory to a small group of aspiring engineers. More information on what we do can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.hackbrightacademy.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.hackbrightacademy.com</a>.<p>We're looking for engineers who really know their stuff and are looking for something different. Generalists or specialists of any discipline are welcome; we value communication more than any other specific skill. We write and teach in python and javascript, but that shouldn't matter to you.<p>Alongside teaching, your responsibilities will include designing curriculum and writing internal tools. We're offering a developer's salary, equity, and an absurd amount of vacation time.<p>We're not building earth-shattering software here, but we're empowering a new generation of engineers to do so. If that interests you, email me at c@hackbrightacademy.com.","time":1346607771,"type":"comment"}
