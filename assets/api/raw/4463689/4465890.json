Full Time (H1B okay) - Ness Computing <a href=\"http://likeness.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://likeness.com</a><p>We are machine learning specialists who work together on real-world challenges. Everyone on our team takes ownership of problem-solving, from ideas all the way through implementation. Our favorite types of problems are the ones that others consider impossible.<p>Everything the ML team builds is product-driven to solve a specific customer pain. While we are looking for people who are experts in a specific area, we believe that the best solutions come from collaboration. We expect people to apply their expertise to domains they have not previously worked in.<p>We use principled machine learning approaches, and encode product-level intuition and needs, but are comfortable with using heuristics to get the last mile.<p>You should be familiar with recent ML literature.<p>Bonus points if you have a deep background in one of the following:\n+  information retrieval / search ranking, natural language processing\n+  collaborative filtering, ontology management / data normalization\n+  data mining packages such as Weka, SAS, EViews, Matlab and R\n+  \"big-data\" frameworks such as Hadoop, HBase, or Cassandra<p>If what we are doing sounds interesting to you, please drop me a line.","time":1346551572,"type":"comment"}
