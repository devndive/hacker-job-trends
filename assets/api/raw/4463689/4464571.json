For those of us on the UI team it's been an extra challenge -- there are lots of people out there who have experience with toolkits like jQuery, Ext, Sencha Touch, and a whole bunch of other ones, some of which we've never heard of. But we're not simply using frameworks, we're pushing them well beyond what they were intended to do. So if you've got relevant framework experience, that's great. But we really need engineers that are good at the basics: JavaScript, DOM, HTML, and CSS. You'll also need to be decent at UI design and user experience. If you're not just good but great at either of these things (or both!), that's awesome, but we also need you to be able to write code. This isn't just a run of the mill web dev job. This is actual, hard core software engineering, it just happens that the stuff we're (the UI team) doing is all running in the browser.<p>Tidemark is building a hosted business analytics system, which is way more interesting than it might sound. The company is well-funded and we have people with decades of experience in the field.<p>We've got a bunch of other openings as well (see <a href=\"http://tidemark.net/company/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://tidemark.net/company/careers</a>)<p><pre><code>    * Technical Support Engineer\n    * Director of People Operations\n    * Operations Engineer\n    * Graphic Designer - Web Developer Emphasis\n    * Sr. Technical Writer\n    * Enterprise Account Executive\n    * Application Tier Developer\n    * Computation Engine Developer\n</code></pre>\nIf any of these positions sound interesting, my email is on my profile page.","time":1346523462,"type":"comment"}
