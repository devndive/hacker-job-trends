We started a year ago in YC and have brought basic programming literacy to people who didn't know the difference between JS and Java.  We have a lot more to teach and we're looking for designers and developers to help us get there.<p>The boring stuff: we're a small team (12 full timers) with opportunities for people to have an outsized impact.  We have the privilege of working with great investors (YC, Union Square Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, etc.) but, most importantly, of working with great peers (check them out here: codecademy.com/about).  People on our team are Rhodes Scholars, published poets, instigators of international movements, and more.<p>Join us and help the world learn to code.  codecademy.com/jobs or email us at jobs@codecademy.com.","time":1346533172,"type":"comment"}
