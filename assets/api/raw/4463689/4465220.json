In addition, some idea as to how vmware/xen/hyperv environments work, as well as things like exchange/SQL Server/etc. - that is what customers have to back up.<p>This individual should be a \"lifer\".  If you're pursuing an exciting and lucrative career in the field of Information Technology, don't contact us.  If you're not running your own mail server, jailbreaking your own devices, running your own servers and appliances (FreeNAS, OpenWRT, etc.) at home, you're not going to fit here.<p>OTOH, if you're a \"fixer\" who can \"just make things work\" and can juggle a collection of high priority clients, please contact us:  info@rsync.net","time":1346535243,"type":"comment"}
