We're making real games for a large audience. Not ultra casual, not niche-y.<p>Our first title is a cooperative multiplayer 3D action-RPG. Think Diablo on Facebook. But free-to-play, and no big download. No obscure plugins, either -- we use Flash, but you wouldn't believe it. Adobe says they've never seen anything higher quality in Flash.<p>Seriously, check out our trailer: <a href=\"https://www.rumblegames.com/kingsroad\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.rumblegames.com/kingsroad</a> (and that was 6 months ago)<p>We're in closed beta. Let me know if you want to give it a test drive.<p>Rumble is backed by Google Ventures and Khosla Ventures ($15mm series A). We have one of the strongest founding teams the gaming industry has ever seen. (No, really: <a href=\"https://www.rumblegames.com/about/our-team\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.rumblegames.com/about/our-team</a>)<p>We're both a developer and publisher of games, and we need help on both sides.
