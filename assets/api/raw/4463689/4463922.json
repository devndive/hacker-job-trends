That is why we are building tools to allow p2p marketplaces build more trust in their communities, as we see trust or the lack thereof as a major roadblock.<p>We are a very young, but driven startup that is starting at Startupbootcamp Berlin this week. One of the founders grew up in Berlin, a great city to have a perfect work-life balance, but we also have been involved in the Boston scene and believe we can bring the best of both worlds together.<p>We are an all-technical team with allround-capabilities, working on a Rails/Neo4j Stack and looking for people that could help us on the development side, but really, we want to talk to any of you who believe in our mission that a world where people can trust each other is a better world and a world worth building. And on the way, have loads of fun with us.<p>Please contact me at nam@webcred.co with anything, I would be happy to talk to you.","time":1346512623,"type":"comment"}
