Ideally, you don't rely completely on mockup tools like Dreamweaver and can code the CSS by hand. You should have strong opinions about the correct way to architect the design aspect of a webapp. Have you migrated stylesheets to SASS or LESS, integrated JavaScript unit testing into a continuous build process or other cool stuff that a bunch of backend developers have never done? Talk to us.<p>Programming abilities are strongly desired, but not strictly required. You would necessarily need to do some JavaScript and jQuery as needed for the UI development, but good programming fundamentals and the ability to pick up (or already know) things like Java and SQL would be a huge plus.\nIf you think you might be a fit, contact information is in my profile. Portfolios or github profiles are encouraged. Resumes are also welcome.<p>Perks include market salary, health/dental/vision/life, unlimited paid vacation plan, 401K.<p><a href=\"http://www.mobicorp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mobicorp.com/</a>","time":1346510743,"type":"comment"}
