We believe existing\nmechanisms for programming distributed systems are difficult and error-prone.  To solve this, we invented a development\nplatform to construct high-performance large-scale applications, and we are building applications using this\nframework to validate our beliefs.<p>We already have customers using our software in production environments.<p>We're looking for engineers with C++ development experience that have an interest in distributed systems and/or compilers.<p>If you're interested, please email me - nflath@optumsoft.com","time":1343870330,"type":"comment"}
