We are looking for people who have done work in search (Lucene etc) and also in recommendation systems. Any one who has done a bunch of stuff in Machine Learning, Scala and worked with lots of data (Any members of the Hadoop family) is welcome to join us trying to make better recommendations. We have been around for a while but are in the midst of doing significant changes to our system which personally to me has been an incredible learning opportunity. Please feel free to contact me  ( eshvk@stumbleupon.com) if you have any questions and I will get you talking to a recruiter ASAP.<p>Perks:<p>Gym reimbursement, commute reimbursement, Uber Credits (yay!), free dental, vision and health insurance, 401K match, and the usual toys like get a macbook pro, play ping pong and wii. The best part of it is that we are in SoMa!","time":1343843447,"type":"comment"}
