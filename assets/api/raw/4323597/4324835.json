The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.<p>It's widely held that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. We believe that faster sharing of research will lead to an acceleration in research innovation: faster innovation in medicine, biology, engineering, economics, and other fields. Faster sharing in biology and medicine, for example, could lead to cancer being solved 12 months before it otherwise would have been, which would lead to millions of lives being saved.<p>Academia.edu has over 1.5 million registered users, and over 3.5 million monthly unique visitors. Both of these metrics tripled in 2011. Over 4,500 papers are added to the platform each day, and over 3,500 academics join each day.<p>We need talented engineers to help us accelerate the world's research. We believe that science is currently dysfunctional, and that there is a chance to make a big impact.<p>We just raised $4.5 million from Spark Capital and True Ventures <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3297812\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3297812</a>.
