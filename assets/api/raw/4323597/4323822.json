You'd be working with me on client work (being the CTO and dev team for startups), internal projects, open-source projects, and even your own side projects. If you want to check out some of our existing open-source projects, see <a href=\"http://os.alfajango.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://os.alfajango.com</a>.<p>I have a pretty good network of developers, and so I usually just work with people I know, but I like the HN crew, so I figured I'd put this out there.<p>Requirements:<p>An unbridled, unfettered, bursting passion for learning, building, startups, and open-source. This doesn't necessarily mean you already have your own open-source projects or side projects or whatever, though it helps.<p>We use mainly ruby and javascript (front-end and back-end) and git, but we also like experimenting and welcome new experiences.<p>Application Process:<p>Ha, no. Just shoot me an email (in my profile) and we'll talk.","time":1343838217,"type":"comment"}
