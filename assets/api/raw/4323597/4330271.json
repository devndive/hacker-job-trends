Freedom Freight is here to change that by deploying the world's first mobile platform for on-demand freight shipping. Over $30 billion dollars a month is spent trucking freight around the US, without it, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In a such a massive market, it's hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines, but until now, it has. This means millions of hours are wasted and thousands of drivers are sitting idle or driving empty. We are changing that.<p>We're looking to bring Rails and iOS developers on the team. We're a small, flat company and this is a fantastic opportunity to join a great team trying to conquer one of the largest markets in the US.<p>If you think Freedom Freight would be the perfect fit, send an email with your info to sean@freedomfreightusa.com","time":1343932977,"type":"comment"}
