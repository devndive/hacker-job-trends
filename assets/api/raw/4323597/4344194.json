We just received funding from prestigious VCs (unannounced).<p>You say Content Management sucks? That’s exactly what we think, and we see a huge opportunity to do something completely different that plays well with HTML5/JS and native mobile apps.\nThe initial version of our platform is already used by hundreds of customers, from major global media companies to small development agencies.<p>It’s now time to throw away the prototype of our API and to build a high-performance solution, from scratch. We already have a team for the backend and are now looking for an iOS developer who will create an iOS SDK and example applications.<p>We’re looking for someone who already has a solid experience in writing and testing iOS applications and that has a good knowledge of the iOS ecosystem and its frameworks (CoreData etc.). You should have a good Computer Science foundation and an authentic interest in working with Objective-C and Cocoa. One of the main jobs besides developing will be to involve the iOS community with talks at conferences and interesting prototypes.<p>Interested? Please send your GitHub account and any other interesting links about you to sascha@thriventures.com.<p>P.S.: The only language in the company is English and living in Berlin without any knowledge of German isn't a problem at all.","time":1344236226,"type":"comment"}
