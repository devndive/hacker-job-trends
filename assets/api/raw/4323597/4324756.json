Current market solutions are\nbroken and tedious and we're building a way for people to be healthy\nand achieve their goals without preventing people from living their\nnormal day-to-day lives.<p>We are an engineering driven company who are very product driven and\nlove building things that solve peoples' problems. Our stack is Python\n(Flask) and MongoDB on the backend and we use a modern combination of\nHTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend. People who have portfolios,\ninteresting projects, or funny little hacks will be noticed the most.<p>Our core algorithm that drives the product's value proposition is\nPython + NumPy, we're looking for people that have experience building\nsystems involving things like constraint solving and searching static\nsets in NumPy. If you like the idea of working on big data and\nalgorithmic problems, get ahold of me!<p>Contact me at the email address in my profile...please include any\nmaterial about yourself you like, resume/cv, portfolio, github, past\nprojects, OSS contributions, anything. CODE SPEAKS THE LOUDEST!<p>Cheers all!","time":1343845970,"type":"comment"}
