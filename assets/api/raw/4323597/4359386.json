{"by":"Ronnie76er","id":4359386,"parent":4323597,"text":"Newtown Square, PA (Philadelphia suburbs)<p>konciergeMD (<a href=\"http://konciergemd.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://konciergemd.com/</a>) is an early stage startup in the Philly suburbs. We're building a product that changes how caregivers and providers collaborate to deliver healthcare. We're a small, polyglot team with diverse backgrounds. Our stack is Java/Scala on the back end and HTML5/CSS3/Javascript on the front end. We care deeply about aesthetics. We care deeply about coffee. We are seeking developers who are equally comfortable with front and back end development and who understand web-scale, high-availability, high-traffic application architectures.<p>We're looking to bring on a top-notch software engineer, a pragmatist focused on shipping. We are open to contract or full-time work candidates. You will play a role in shaping this product -- this is core to our culture, so bring your opinions. We're generalists, but the path we're blazing will heavily rely on Javascript, jQuery, Backbone.js, HTML5, CSS3, Java, Scala, Play Framework, and Amazon Web Services. We're web first but mobile is quickly approaching on the horizon. Bonus points if you have experience working with medical informatics. Gold stars if you have experience working with big data, machine learning, or semantic web.<p>If you're interested, ping ron@konciergemd.com.","time":1344482899,"type":"comment"}
