To do it, in the past year, we've filled up Riak clusters with raw HTTP requests, built a large-scale source code cross referencer for 30 languages, wrote and rewrote a debugger core in Ruby, wrote another in Go, built software fuzzer farms with Redis, tested 3 different proprietary trading protocols, broke sandboxing schemes, built tools to attack chipsets, broke numerous cryptosystems, and gave several talks at Black Hat.<p>Our customers are excellent; they include Github, 37signals, and numerous YC companies.<p>Our team is even better. What are we looking for? Here's my first interview question: \"what is your research project going to be for us?\" Does this stuff interest you? We should talk. WE LOVE TALKING TO DEVELOPERS. You don't have to be a \"rock star ninja shaolin grandmaster security pro\", wear the right jeans, or listen to Animal Collective (please don't listen to Animal Collective). We just want you to be able to learn fast and not get scared when you're faced with wacky systems in languages you've never used and there's a clock ticking.<p>Downsides: Not building things people want. In fact, building things people fear and loathe. Also, not being able to wear silver, eat garlic, or enter houses without express invitation.<p>Perks: Infinite free tech books, medical, dental, vision, 401k.<p><i>If I were looking for a day job, I wouldn't be looking for a day job any more: they're friendly, happy people who get social license to join the Dark Side, do smart stuff all \nday, and then go home while it is still light out.</i> - HN:patio11<p>More than you ever wanted to know about our recruiting process:<p><a href=\"http://www.matasano.com/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.matasano.com/careers</a>","time":1343839209,"type":"comment"}
