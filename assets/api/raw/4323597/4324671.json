We collect GPS data from black boxes installed in cars, and from smartphone apps, and we analyse it to work out how well you are driving, so insurers can provide a fair price for insurance. This means that good drivers can get cheaper car insurance. We work with RoSPA in the UK for driver behavioural research into what constitutes good driving. We have customers and commercial pilots across Europe and South Africa with a range of global insurance companies, brokers and aggregators.<p>Our processing engine is predominantly Ruby 1.9, with a Rails (3.2, rspec, cucumber etc) API frontend backed by Postgres. Redis and Resque power the processing queue, and we occasionally drop down to C++ for some number crunching (normally libs wrapped up in FFI Ruby bindings). We've got Cassandra for large scale querying and storage, and we manage all of this on AWS using Chef. We use Github, Campfire, Hubot, and Janky for code, collaboration and CI.<p><i>Who are we looking for?</i><p>We've potentially got a few vacancies over the next few months as more customers launch, but right now we're looking for a systems lead who can help keep our infrastructure running 24/7 as we grow, and also help our customers integrate with us. Ideally someone with experience of running large web services on AWS using Chef.<p>If you'd like to know more, email me: gavin dot heavyside at mydrivesolutions dot com","time":1343845176,"type":"comment"}
