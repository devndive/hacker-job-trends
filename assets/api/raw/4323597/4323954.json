We have two offices.<p>Cinemagram (<a href=\"http://cinemagr.am\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cinemagr.am</a>) is an application for creating awesome hybrids between photos and videos. We are growing fast and are looking for talented individuals to help us bring this new medium to the masses.<p>Like everyone else we are looking for talented people, more precisely people that are better than us :) We have many needs and I'm not keen on requiring specific skills, as long as you are bright I want to talk to you. Cinemagram heavily uses openGL, does a lot of video processing and computer vision. The challenges are great. We want to use the phone to its limit and the application in its current state is only the beginning.<p>Note that we also need help with the back-end. If you have experience scaling a massive site or an app, I want to talk to you too :) We need help on the Android front as well.<p>We haven't made any technical hires yet. It's a great time to join us. You'll have tremendous impact on the product. The pay will be super competitive along with a generous options package.<p>Feel free to contact me directly : marc@cinemagr.am, looking forward to talking with you!<p>Marc, co-founder","time":1343839121,"type":"comment"}
