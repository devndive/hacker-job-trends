We're a Southern Vermont-based consultancy which was founded in 2000. We started writing production apps in Rails in '05 and have grown to a team of nine developers, two project managers, and a UX designer. We focus in the areas of Education, Health and the Environment. We have many great projects such as a scoring system Starbucks uses to facilitate the inspection of 90% of the farms they buy coffee from[1], an archive of all the LEED certified buildings in the world[2], and storytelling software for people with memory loss[3].<p>If these types of projects sound interesting, we'd love to hear from you. You'd have the option of either working out of our beautiful Vermont office overlooking the Connecticut River, joining our new Cambridge-based team, working remotely, or some combination thereof.  Significant experience with Ruby &#38; specifically Rails a huge plus, but if you have experience with other web technologies, still get in touch.<p>Email us: jobs@greenriver.com<p>-Ben<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://www.starbucks.com/responsibility/sourcing/coffee\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.starbucks.com/responsibility/sourcing/coffee</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"http://gbig.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://gbig.org/</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"http://www.timeslips.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.timeslips.org/</a>","time":1343838142,"type":"comment"}
