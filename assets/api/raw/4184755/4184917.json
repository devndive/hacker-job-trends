We're trying to open source as much as we can (e.g., <a href=\"https://github.com/rglabs/teleport\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/rglabs/teleport</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/gip/resque-telework\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/gip/resque-telework</a>).<p>#5 - If the notion of \"spray and pray\" recruiting makes you a little nauseous and you want to do something about it, you should contact us. :)<p>#6 - We work out of a beautiful and well-lit loft in the Mission, close to Coffee Bar, Blowfish, Atlas and a host of other cool coffee shops and restaurants.<p>#7 - We're going big on this one.<p>I'm the founder and you can email me directly at jon at entelo dot com or call me at 310-351-7275.","time":1341154906,"type":"comment"}
