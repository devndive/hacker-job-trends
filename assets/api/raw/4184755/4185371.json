One of our favourite things to do is delete code. We're weird like that.<p>We move fast. Any developer can commit and have their code in production in under 20 minutes, including the test suite running. No bureaucracy, no branch-merging with code reviews, no scheduled downtime. Build a feature and get it into thousands of people's hands in under an hour.<p>We have a fun, creative, open culture that encourages free expression and diversity. You won't find brogrammers here, just great people doing their best work.<p>We're well-funded (Andreessen-Horowitz, Sean Parker, Chris Hughes and others) and we're looking to change the world.<p>Just a year after beta, we're already shaking up politics, the non-profit/advocacy sector, and enabling filmmakers and musicians to liberate themselves from old models of marketing and distribution.<p>This journey is just beginning, and an exciting road lies ahead. If you're interested in joining us, we'd love to talk to you.<p><a href=\"http://nationbuilder.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://nationbuilder.com/jobs</a><p><a href=\"http://dev.nationbuilder.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dev.nationbuilder.com/jobs</a><p>Cheers,<p>Dan Walmsley\nVP of Engineering, NationBuilder","time":1341162691,"type":"comment"}
