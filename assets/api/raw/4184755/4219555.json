Outside of launching the sites mentioned above, our team members were there for the launches of TV.com, Zazzle, and Bloglines. We run a fairly flat organization within the team and try to ship on schedule.<p>Send us some code\nAlong with your sites please send us some code or small project you're proud of to danny.chi@cbsinteractive.com","time":1341857929,"type":"comment"}
