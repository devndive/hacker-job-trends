Looking for Software Developers across the stack.\n<a href=\"http://www.refresh.io/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.refresh.io/jobs</a>\njobs@refresh.io\nYou're a crack-shot software engineer. Not necessarily because of where you went to school, but because simply put - you love this stuff. You know at least one mobile/web-related computer language cold. Whether it's Objective-C, Ruby, Java Javascript, or others - we're not too concerned about which one because no matter which one (or ones) we end up using, you'll not only be able to pick it up fast, you'll be excited about doing so.\nYou understand the latest technology. From NoSQL to Backbone to Node. You aren't technically religious and gain as much satisfaction in picking the right tool for the job as you do implementing it.\nYou've built stuff. Web sites. Mobile apps. Whatever. You can show us. You can't wait to show us. You're not only excited of what users can do with it, you're proud about how it's implemented and to a technical audience, and you can't wait to talk about it.\nAs part of the first engineering team, you're excited by the prospect of working with smart people. Because you're smart and you know it - and you know that working with other smart people simply makes you better (all the while making them better too). As a bonus, being part of this initial team gives you the opportunity to strongly affect future engineering hires - insuring the caliber of the team.\nYou live within commuting distance to Palo Alto, CA or are willing to relocate (paid).","time":1341160283,"type":"comment"}
