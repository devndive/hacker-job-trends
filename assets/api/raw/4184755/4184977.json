We do a huge variety of things and we like to run our teams with a startup results-driven feel.<p>We are primary consumers of billions of incoming pieces of data daily and redistribute it to over 180 countries on one of the largest private networks in the world, producing software which provides discovery, analytics, visualization and much more.<p>Contact me if you want to discuss at andrew@ishiboo.com.<p>If you want to chat in person, we are a sustaining sponsor of NYTM and are at all the meetups. I'll be at GothamJS and dotJS later this year. Also, Matt Turck @ Bloomberg Ventures runs the NY Data Business Meetup at our offices every month and I'm almost always there.","time":1341155835,"type":"comment"}
