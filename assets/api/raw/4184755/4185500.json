Our clients include many of the world's largest companies--and the White House bunker.  More and more often I can drive down the road, point to a sign or a truck and say 'hey, they use Stormpulse!'.  It's fun.<p>We are designers.  We are independent.  Our mapping and weather data systems have been written from scratch.  We have a vision to take our product far beyond what anyone else has ever seen or imagined in the weather space, which effects every person on the planet.<p>Our platform is written in Python, JavaScript (jQuery, backbone, bootstrap), nginx, Postgres, PostGIS, Flash, haXe, MySQL on Amazon EC2 + S3.<p>We are Matt, Brad, Josh, and Bryan.
