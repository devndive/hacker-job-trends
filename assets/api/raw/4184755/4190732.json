The team is comprised of Harvard students, YC founders, iRobot alumni, etc. We're currently located in Las Vegas as part of Tony Hsieh's investment fund, but spend a great deal of our time in Palo Alto / SF.<p>We're looking for funny and brilliant people who design and build awesome hardware and software.
