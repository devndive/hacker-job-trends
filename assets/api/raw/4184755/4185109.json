{"by":"sashthebash","id":4185109,"parent":4184755,"text":"Berlin, Germany (\"H1B\") - StorageRoom - JavaScript<p>We’re building a cloud-based Content Management platform that’s targeted at developers. We just received funding from prestigious VCs (unannounced).<p>You say Content Management sucks? That’s exactly what we think, and we see a huge opportunity to do something completely different that plays well with HTML5/JS and native mobile apps.<p>The initial version of our platform is already used by hundreds of customers, from major global media companies to small development agencies.<p>It’s now time to throw away the prototype of our API and to build a high-performance solution, from scratch. We want to bring aboard a person who will develop the new JavaScript frontend, public JS SDK and JavaScript server component with us (yes, we’re developers too!).<p>We’re looking for someone who already has a solid experience in writing and testing JavaScript applications and that has a good knowledge of the JavaScript ecosystem (CoffeeScript, Node, Rhino, ClojureScript) and its frameworks (Backbone, Spine etc). You should have a good Computer Science foundation and an authentic interest in working with JavaScript. Experience in functional programming languages will be considered a plus. One of the main jobs besides developing will be to involve the JS community with talks at conferences and interesting prototypes.<p>Interested? Please send your GitHub account and any other interesting links about you to sascha@thriventures.com.<p>P.S.: The only language in the company is English and living in Berlin without any knowledge of German isn't a problem at all.","time":1341158205,"type":"comment"}
