If you are a super smart generalist who can work on the servers one day and optimize complex algorithms the next, we want to hear from you. You will be our first non-founder web engineer and will work directly with the founders.<p>Ability to work from our Backbone.js front-end to our Ruby on Rails back-end is a must. Experience with server management and databases is a plus. Some days you will help keep the servers up and others you will be adjusting algorithms and designs that affect 100s of thousands of people.<p>We're currently a tiny team of 5, and have an open and friendly culture, where ideas are encouraged to be shared by everyone. Did I mention that we have a ping-pong table?<p>We're building something incredibly meaningful. Everyme is bringing together families, couples and best friends who otherwise wouldn't communicate. This isn't just another social network, but a significant mission to change how people share. Candidates will hopefully understand and have a passion for privacy, not to mention have an appetite for going up against Goliath.<p>We are well funded by top-tier VCs and angels, including Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock, CrunchFund, SV Angel and more. Come and join our small team of 5, which includes ex-Facebookers, ex-MySpacers, and successful iPhone and Android app developers. We offer market salary, generous equity and awesome perks!<p>To apply, please get in touch with me or email jobs@everyme.com!
