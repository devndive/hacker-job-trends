Remote within Illinois\nLead Software Engineer - Ounce of Prevention Fund (Non Profit)<p>We're looking for a lead software developer to lead up development of our Head Start/Early Head Start web app - the trick is we have an ancient platform that we're looking to replatform, so our \"next generation\" platform has some flexibility around the actual technology but we're moving to a modern framework.<p>We're looking for someone that can help us create the new version - we're ripping out the guts of our old web app, replacing most of it with an off the shelf early childhood education app, and building new, user friendly goodness around it based on the needs of our org.\nWe want to work with cool, high performing people, that give a damn about society.<p>1. Work location can be somewhat flexible (potentially remote most of the time) - but it's easiest for use if they're based in Illinois somewhere.\n2. We have a 37.5 hour work week (and typically stick pretty close to that)\n3. Pay is competitive (non profit doesn't mean we work for free)\n4.
