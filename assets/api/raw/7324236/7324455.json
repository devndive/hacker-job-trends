There are 10 engineers in the office and we&#x27;re looking to grow to 40 by year&#x27;s end.<p>We need one iOS developer and lots of full-stack web developers for a variety of projects.<p>I&#x27;ve been at Fitbit since November (previously Google) and Fitbit is an awesome place to work. The company culture is fantastic. The people are great to work with. The Boston office feels like a startup because it&#x27;s so small and new, yet we&#x27;re well-funded and secure. Everywhere I go people tell me they love our product or know someone who loves it and talks about it.<p>Send resumes and&#x2F;or questions to blewis@ the obvious domain, or post questions here, or look for me near the Fitbit booth at the Boston Web Innovators Group on Monday night.","time":1393687020,"type":"comment"}
