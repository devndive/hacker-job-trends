All of our work is done on a project-to-project basis, primarily in the form of consulting for clients.<p>Looking mostly for those with a bit of PHP and&#x2F;or Rails experience, and some HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS knowledge. But internships are built for learning, so if you&#x27;re shaky on these, that&#x27;s okay! We love teaching and mentoring.<p>Internships at Whiteboard are always paid. We look for people who fit both culture and business needs, and who are highly motivated and teachable.<p>Email me directly (email is in my bio) if you&#x27;re interested!","time":1393732325,"type":"comment"}
