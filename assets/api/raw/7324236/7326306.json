We hire several interns every summer and year-round.<p>That said, we care way more about your personality and general hacking skills then what languages you&#x27;ve used so far, so if you haven&#x27;t used these but want to break into mobile or web development, this could be a good opportunity for you. We&#x27;ve hired people from these threads with everywhere from 0 to 10 years of experience.<p>We&#x27;re profitable, very well funded and have a really fun office environment (go-karts + a rock climbing wall!). Scribd alumni have gone on to found 4 other YCombinator companies, more than from any other startup. We think this says something about the kind of people that we like to hire, and we love hiring people with entrepreneur and startup ambitions. We are also always looking for international people interested in moving to the US and can help you secure a visa.<p>We recently launched a service that&#x27;s being called the &quot;Netflix for books&quot; and are really excited about it.
