A non-trivial percentage of Americans take 5 or more prescription medications a day and they are being poorly served by the usual pharmacy experience: it&#x27;s poorly designed, hugely inconvenient and doesn&#x27;t actually focus on customer wellness.<p>We launched about a month ago and both customer feedback and press coverage has been quite positive. Our customer base is growing faster than expected and we&#x27;ve got ample investment to fuel growth for a couple of years.<p>We&#x27;re a small team, so we&#x27;re looking for coworkers who enjoy a great deal of autonomy and are as good at figuring out what to build as they are at building it. Our stack is currently Rails + Mongo + Foundation but prior experience isn&#x27;t a necessity.<p>Formal postings are on our careers page (<a href=\"https://pillpack.com/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pillpack.com&#x2F;careers</a>) but feel free to email me directly at jordan@pillpack.com if you&#x27;d prefer.","time":1393705510,"type":"comment"}
