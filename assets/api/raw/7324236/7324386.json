It is designed to be more memory safe (far and away the #1 cause of browser engine security bugs!) through use of the new Rust programming language, and also to take advantage of modern hardware by implementing the Web Platform with support for parallelism and concurrency.<p>We’re looking for some very senior people to join us and provide technical leadership and mentoring for major areas of this project. In particular, if you have a deep background in either the implementation of layout of the Web, the implementation of the DOM and its integration with JavaScript engines, or with systems programming (particularly in the spaces of graphics, networking, and mobile), we’d love to talk with you.<p>Apply online at:<p><a href=\"https://careers.mozilla.org/en-US/position/ovGrYfwk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;position&#x2F;ovGrYfwk</a><p>This is Mozilla, so our development and roadmap is completely open.
