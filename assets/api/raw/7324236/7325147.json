We’re Red Hot Labs from San Francisco and we&#x27;re looking for a FULL-TIME DEV and a FULL-TIME ADMIN&#x2F;GENERALIST.<p>We&#x27;re on a mission to revolutionize how mobile developers harness their data.  Our product, still in beta, functions as the central hub for all the services mobile developers already use.  By weaving together the data from these disparate services, we gain a comprehensive view of the app and are uniquely positioned to deliver insights and value back to the developer.<p>This isn&#x27;t our first trip around the block.  Our previous startup was acquired by Zynga and our core technology turned into FarmVille and the rest of Zynga’s most successful games.  It was a wild ride and now we’re full steam ahead on a new adventure. We&#x27;re well backed by folks such as A16Z, Greylock, SVAngel, DCVC, and more.<p>We&#x27;re looking for passionate, energetic, highly talented engineers to join our team.  By becoming a foundational member of our team you will help shape the direction of our product, company and culture.  We’re believe in constantly challenging ourselves to learn new things and would love to teach you what we know and learn from you as well.<p>We want all engineering members of the team to be full-stack engineers and well-rounded individuals.  But, we&#x27;re especially excited about the following engineering profiles:<p>==================================<p><pre><code>  - Senior Product Engineer: You&#x27;ve built products from  concept all the way to \n  maturity.  You&#x27;re as opinionated and influential about product as you are about coding.  \n  You&#x27;re a master at JS&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;HTML and customer facing technologies. \n  Bonus points if you’re on-top of your front-end frameworks like Angular \n  (which we use!), Ember, or Meteor.\n\n  - Senior Systems Engineer: You&#x27;ve architected and scaled backend systems to \n  millions of users.  You&#x27;ve put out every kind of fire and learned a lot in the \n  process. You understand the tradeoffs of different data stores, server \n  architectures, and low-level services. \n\n  - Senior Data Engineer: You&#x27;ve built models which extract insights or \n  predictions from large, living datasets.  You can engage with a dataset in an \n  unfamiliar domain, grasp the dynamics of the system and impress subject area \n  experts with your result.  \n\n  - Stupendous Junior Engineer: You don&#x27;t have years of working experience, but \n  you have handful of mind-blowing personal or school projects.  You were among \n  the best students at a top tier engineering university. Your TA&#x27;s and \n  classmates gush about your code.\n\n</code></pre>\nOUR STACK:<p><pre><code>  - Redis, MySQL, Rails for our backend API.\n  - Mostly AWS with a little bit of Heroku for our hosting.\n  - AngularJS, jQuery, Underscore, Node.JS with D3 for our dashboard and web apps.\n  - 3rd party services: Facebook, Mixpanel, Stripe, Mailgun\n</code></pre>\n==================================<p>In addition, we&#x27;re hiring for an admin&#x2F;generalist position. We&#x27;re looking for someone that doesn&#x27;t necessarily know how to code (if you&#x27;re interested in learning we can definitely help you there!), but is passionate about startups and is competent and considerate in any task thrown their way. This role would be to support the rest of the team to help with marketing, sales, general office admin stuff, scheduling interviews, QA, and so on. Basically, all of the &quot;other stuff&quot; in a startup.<p>Do any of the above profiles sound like you?
