The product is near complete, but also has an awesome roadmap of upcoming features. Beta-tester feedback has been outstanding. For more info, please check out the soon-to-be-released home page can be found here:<p><a href=\"http://jtlist.co/1fE7MWB\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jtlist.co&#x2F;1fE7MWB</a><p>You&#x27;ll be joining on as number two at the company. You should love learning, solving hard problems, and be interested in culture building. You should believe that unicorns are made, not born :) You should also be familiar with most of the technologies in our stack: Node&#x2F;Express, Javascript&#x2F;Coffeescript, MongoDB, Redis and Backbone.<p>I&#x27;m hiring a variety of roles which may include summer interns, developers, a CTO, and a community manager. We&#x27;ll be working on a pretty full combination of improving&#x2F;writing new algorithms, performing data analysis, automating front-end testing (backend testing is largely completed), and building intuitive and beautiful user experiences.<p>I&#x27;ve open-sourced the underlying task queue at <a href=\"https://github.com/brandoncarl/taskco\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brandoncarl&#x2F;taskco</a>. I&#x27;d like to open-source a few of the other technologies as the team grows.<p>Please contact me at brandon.carl@justthelist.com for more details.","time":1393716904,"type":"comment"}
