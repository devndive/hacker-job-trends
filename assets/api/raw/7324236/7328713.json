Please see the job description here: <a href=\"http://www.treasuredata.com/en/careers/careers-posting-005.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.treasuredata.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;careers&#x2F;careers-posting-005.p...</a><p>We are a Mountain View based startup making it super easy for people to get value for their ever-growing datasets.<p>Aside: Last summer, I posted a similar job post here for summer internship, thinking not much about it. A couple of days later, we got an email from a college student in Puerto Rico who meekly asked us to take a look at his GitHub.<p>He had some stuff there that looked cool, and more than anything, we needed to hire a frontend engineer. So, we gave him a 24-hour coding quiz, he passed it, we gave him a round of phone interviews, and he passed that too.<p>Two weeks later, he was in our office writing Rails and JavaScript as our first summer intern.<p>The best part? He is still with us. He decided to take a leave from college and instead make our frontend slicker that we could ever imagined.","time":1393759322,"type":"comment"}
