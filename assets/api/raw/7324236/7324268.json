But above all, our technology lets you manipulate data in a way that is extremely intuitive and a joy to use compared to today’s data frameworks: you get native data structures that you can just iterate on, standard access methods, and all the good stuff you’d expect to be able to do in the 21st century. Thanks to this, developers are able to develop apps much faster, but also deliver on use-cases that are impossible to conceive today.<p>We are now looking for a native iOS developer with at least 2 years full-time experience who can help us refine the product, make our native interface even more delightful, and build next-generation apps using it.<p>We offer competitive salary, stock options, catered lunches and all the usuals bells &amp; whistles.
