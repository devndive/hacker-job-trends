Or perhaps working on state of the art computer vision algorithms to figure out how to extract highly precise body dimensions from a mobile phone photograph? Or how about making our award-winning iOS app even more awesome? (we were Apple&#x27;s Valentine&#x27;s Day featured app). We&#x27;re well-funded, and have a small friendly team of smart people (Google alums, former YC founders, etc). Right now, we&#x27;re especially interested in hiring a lead iOS engineer and some really bright computer vision engineers. If that sounds like something you&#x27;re interested in, shoot me a note at eugene@thirdlove.com. I&#x27;ll respond to each and every single e-mail. Send me sample projects you&#x27;ve worked on and I&#x27;ll respond to you before anyone else :)<p>Perks:\n- a beautiful office space right next to South Park, SOMA (short walk from BART and Caltrain)\n- commuter benefits\n- catered lunches\n- monthly in-office massages\n- competitive salary&#x2F;equity\n- 401k\n- the look on peoples&#x27; faces when you tell them you work for a bra tech start-up","time":1393719961,"type":"comment"}
