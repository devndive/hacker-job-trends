We need full-time people, as well as part-time freelancers who want to build their own projects while working with us.<p>Why we&#x27;re different:<p>- We focus on entrepreneurs and products, and are picky about our clients. Our goal is to learn from everyone we work with.<p>- We reject that idea that a shop needs to be a mill. We work 35hrs&#x2F;week. A common refrain is &quot;why are you still here? go home!&quot;<p>- We&#x27;re developers ourselves. We founded this thing because we love building.<p>- We believe that we win when our employees win, and codify that in great pay and serious profit sharing. When someone tries to steal you away to work on their new idea, I want you to smile and say &quot;I can&#x27;t, my gig&#x27;s too sweet&quot;<p>email us at contact AT tanookilabs.com if you&#x27;d like to chat!","time":1393698259,"type":"comment"}
