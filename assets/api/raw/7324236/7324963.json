We also build machines, write lightweight mobile apps, and create interfaces to machines that weren&#x27;t built with one in mind.<p>Relaxed atmosphere, frequent new projects, ever expanding business. Everyone says disruptive, but the monitoring package we build with allows us provide services at about a fourth of what the traditional options cost (and usually the same factor of development time).<p>We use Python and SQL (Server, but increasingly postgres) every day, but I&#x27;ve dipped into Java, Objective C, and a smidgeon of VBA on the job.<p>For developers, the languages you know are not as important as your ability to solve new problems, learn and grow.<p>We are also looking for PLC programmers and&#x2F;or Controls Engineers.<p>If interested, see my profile for contact info.","time":1393692839,"type":"comment"}
