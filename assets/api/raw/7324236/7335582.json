We’re building mobile tools to help people communicate and collaborate at work, whether they’re knowledge workers or line workers. Mobile phones can mean more than photo-sharing or checkins. They can mean better day-to-day work and more opportunities for people who were left out in the past.<p>What we are looking for: We’re looking for someone to help us build an amazing web experience, both for mobile and desktop. Our product is aimed primarily at mobile users, so it’s very important that our pages are responsive on smaller screens, touch-friendly, and lightweight, while also looking great on traditional desktop displays. We have a ridiculously talented set of engineers and we’re looking for a front-end developer to join us. You’ll have a ton of technical autonomy: should we use Ember, Backbone, something else, or nothing? You lead those decisions.<p>Why us:\nWe’re funded, which means we can pay competitive salaries and offer benefits. We’re also small, which means we don’t waste time on things like tracking vacation and sick days. Our passion is building great products and our goal is to bring them to a wider audience than the web ever let us reach. If that sounds like you, come join us.<p>Look forward to hearing from you! <a href=\"http://boards.greenhouse.io/cotap/jobs/563#%2EUxOxXEJdV1s\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;cotap&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;563#%2EUxOxXEJdV1s</a>","time":1393872803,"type":"comment"}
