Every business has reoccurring processes that are in the heads of the employees and not formalized or tracked.<p>When a business process is only in the head of a couple of employees things get forgotten, important data gets lost, critical steps are missed, and performance analytics are lost.<p>Taskflow.io formalizes business processes online into a clean and easy interface to run a business&#x27;s operations. Taskflow.io collects data on each step a business process, so nothing falls between the cracks and process performance can be easily tracked.<p>JOB DESCRIPTION\nYou will be responsible for two things generating clients and keeping them happy. That&#x27;s it. How you reach your goals is up to you.<p>There are no scripts, there are no mandatory daily requirements. If you are independent and diligent in generating clients and keeping them happy, you will have no problem in this position. If you enjoy sitting on your butt twiddling your thumbs pretending to accomplish things, this job is not for you.<p>QUALIFICATIONS\nGenuine curiosity. Independence. Business to business sales experience. Track record of success.","time":1393701973,"type":"comment"}
