Our main project right now is building an experimental tool to help people live more aligned with the things that matter most to them. If this sounds interesting to you, I&#x27;d love to talk.<p>Right now we&#x27;re looking for either a full stack or front end engineer. Ideally you&#x27;ll have a strong background in one or more areas -- Ruby&#x2F;Rails, JS&#x2F;Coffeescript&#x2F;Angular.js, natural language processing, and data analytics.<p>We&#x27;re a small but ambitious team of folks and everyone wears many hats. This is an ideal position for an engineer looking to play a significant role in the success of our company and direction of our products.<p>Shoot me an email at tyler@freestoneinternational.com","time":1393687089,"type":"comment"}
