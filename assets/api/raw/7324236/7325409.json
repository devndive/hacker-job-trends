We don&#x27;t have a designer, so having an eye towards good UX&#x2F;UI is a plus.<p>We&#x27;re also looking for someone at the CTO level.<p>DaisyBill is located at 34 W 15th Street in Manhattan. We&#x27;re a SaaS vendor serving the workers&#x27; compensation e-billing market.<p>Workers&#x27; comp is a vastly underserved part of the medical e-billing trade which has been a struggle for all parties involved: the injured worker, the practice that treats the injured worker, and the insurance companies that handle the claims&#x2F;bills. Electronic billing aims to make the situation better.<p>DaisyBill manages the entire billing process, both generating and sending the bill electronically and managing the responses about the status of the bill, including when it was paid and how much. As a result of using DaisyBill, practices are paid more quickly and accurately than when they submit bills via paper&#x2F;snail mail. We&#x27;re talking 15 days instead of 60, 90, or more, if at all.  This makes practices more likely to take on injured workers as patients, an obvious benefit for all parties.<p>You can read more about our service offering at www.daisybill.com.<p>The stack we currently run is Rails 3 on Heroku.<p>We use Git for source control and use Macs for development. We develop in an agile manner in the style of ThoughtWorks and Pivotal Labs, using Pivotal Tracker. We like our code to have tests, and as such we have an extensive suite covering the Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript code on the site.<p>Please send all inquiries to jobs@daisybill.com.","time":1393698194,"type":"comment"}
