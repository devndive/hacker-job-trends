If you need people to refrain from flipping through the document, you typically use a heavyweight screen-sharing program like WebEx.<p>Instead of all this, we&#x27;re building a live presentation tool that allows people to collaborate on presentations in keystroke-by-keystroke real-time, both from within PowerPoint itself and on the desktop and mobile Web.<p>It&#x27;s hard to explain fully and our website (<a href=\"http://getliveloop.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;getliveloop.com</a>) doesn&#x27;t have anything about the interesting new things we haven&#x27;t shipped yet. So get in touch at amal@getliveloop.com .<p>Competitive salary and above-competitive equity.","time":1393753366,"type":"comment"}
