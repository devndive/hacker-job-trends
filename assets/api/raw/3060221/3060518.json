Full time and internships.<p>QLabs<p>We're a new type of in-house incubator: we prototype startups by building and launching an MVP every 6-8 weeks.\nThis is like startup boot-camp. Come hack with us on amazing projects, learn everything there is to know about building and launching products and starting companies, all without the painful early-startup salary.<p>We take an aggressive approach to learning and inspiration. Two weeks ago, our team spent an entire day visiting MIT's Media Lab, where we learned about biomechatronics, fluid interfaces, and more. Even though our primary tool is Rails, half of us just learned nodejs for a two-week 'sprint project'.<p>The lab started in February of this year, and now has five awesome developers (hailing from Columbia, ITP, NYC Resistor, and more). We're looking to fill position #6.<p>Show us your projects: we love to see an entrepreneurial streak and a diversity of experience.<p>Email me at rw@rwinslow.com if this appeals to you!","time":1317489996,"type":"comment"}
