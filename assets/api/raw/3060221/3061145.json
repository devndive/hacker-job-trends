INTERN, H1B welcome.<p>If you run an e-commerce website, you probably use google analytics, mixpanel or similar to track your customers and do some funnel analysis, A/B testing etc to optimize your site.<p>If you run a physical retail store though, you're out of luck. How many people walk into my store and leave frustrated, without buying anything? Why isn't my hot new item selling - is no one seeing it, or are they seeing it but not buying because the price is too high? There's no easy way to find answers to these today.<p>Not having cookies or IPs makes tracking in the real-world a real challenge! We primarily acquire data through machine vision algorithms that run against video cameras in the stores and identify and track people, but we also use data from a host of other technologies (RFID, WiFi, Zigbee, etc) to get the full picture.<p>We just closed our series B, and are scaling very fast. We use C/C++, Java, Python and Flex. Our product runs on Linux. We like super-smart generalist hackers who like working on a variety of things - UI development, machine vision algorithms, AI, data mining/analytics on big data (last month we tracked nearly 2M people worldwide!).
