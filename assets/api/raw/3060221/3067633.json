Fundamentally we are trying to massively speed up the rate at which research whizzes around the world. For people who have just published a paper, we want that paper instantly to get into the hands of people who are interested in it. It often takes 12-24 months for a paper to get through the journal publication cycle, and to get distributed to the relevant research community. We believe that this is a large inefficiency in the research process, and we believe that there is an opportunity to make a huge impact here. We want to bring the time it takes for a paper to be distributed around a given research community down from 12-24 months down to a matter of hours.<p>Right now we have over 600,000 academics signed up, with about 2,000 joining each day. Our monthly uniques are over 2 million. We have about 700,000 papers, with about 80,000 new papers being added per month.<p>Amongst other technologies, we work with Rails, Redis, MongoDB, Beanstalkd, Varnish, Solr, PostgreSQL, Node.js and Memcached.<p>We're a small team of 7 people in San Francisco, backed by venture capital (Spark Ventures) and angel investors (Mark Shuttleworth, founder of Ubuntu, and Rupert Pennant-Rea, Chairman of the Economist, amongst others). We have a very engineering-focused culture. You can read more about our culture here <a href=\"http://academia.edu/hiring/culture\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://academia.edu/hiring/culture</a> and here <a href=\"http://academia.edu/hiring\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://academia.edu/hiring</a>.<p>We have a very collaborative culture, where everyone discusses everything going on with the company: engineering, product, revenue, user growth, recruiting. We think that building a successful startup is hard enough that we need to leverage everyone's brain power.<p>We're very happy to handle the H1B application process for foreign applicants. Interns are also welcome to apply; we have an intern program detailed at <a href=\"http://academia.edu/hiring\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://academia.edu/hiring</a>.
