Permanent, full-time, on-site.<p>At YouView we are automating the testing of our product (a set-top box) using stb-tester[1], a tool that we developed and open-sourced which captures video from the set-top box and analyses it in real time.<p>These are early days for the project, so you can have a large impact on its direction and success. One week you might be writing a python module to control a network-controllable power supply; another week it might be a script to generate comprehensive test coverage of a menu tree. There will be tedious work too, but we want the kind of person who hates tedious work so much that they automate it away.<p>Unix shell scripting and administration experience is highly desirable. The test scripts themselves are written in python.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://stb-tester.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://stb-tester.com</a>","time":1351952586,"type":"comment"}
