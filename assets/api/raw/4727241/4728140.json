Last year, Nest established the first corner stone of this vision by releasing its first learning Thermostats; recently, Nest delivered again by introducing the second version of the Thermostat, which was lauded by the New York Times as “gorgeous, elegant, and very, very smart.” [1]<p>Video of our Thermostat: <a href=\"http://goo.gl/nrM2l\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://goo.gl/nrM2l</a><p>To deliver on the vision of bringing Apple-like discipline to home automation, we are currently looking for motivated individuals with any of the following skill sets:<p>-Mobile Developer: iOS or Android<p>-Frontend developers: our frontend stack is in Django, and we’re also using Amber.js, Backbone.js, and more.<p>-Backend Developers: our stack is in Scala, and we’re more than happy to teach you horizontal/vertical scaling.<p>-Algorithm &#38; Machine Learning Experts: the thermostats provide tons of data we use to help people save energy.<p>-EE people in Networking, System Integration, Firmware...etc<p>We’re still a pretty small team but we’ve got big ambitions and are already having a tangible impact (wait ‘til you see our energy saving numbers).
