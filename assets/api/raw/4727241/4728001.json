This firm is not your typical finance outfit, and will actually not look at candidates coming from finance.  They want people coming from low latency, high through-put environments who understand the network stack from top to bottom.  This is a very flat organization, loaded with very passionate developers.  They are also relatively small, about 200 people globally, and they wont be growing much beyond that number.<p>Contact trent.krupp@constitutionllp.com if interested.","time":1351783722,"type":"comment"}
