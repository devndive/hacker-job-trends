H1B[1]<p>Booking.com is always on the lookout for good developers, team leads,\nDBA's and sysadmins on-site in the center of Amsterdam. I'm a\ndeveloper there working on infrastructure tasks and relocated there\njust over two years ago and have been very happy with it.<p>We're currently looking to fill 25 developer positions (which matches\nour growth curve), and are also looking for senior team leads.<p>We have people from all over the world relocating to work with us and\nare very well set up to handle relocation and visa issues, most of the\npeople working in IT are expats so we've got a lot of experience with\nbringing people in. All our internal communication is done in English\nso there's no need to learn Dutch.<p>We use Perl for almost everything with a MySQL backend and Git for\ndevelopment. We get our changes out really fast, it's rare for your\ncode not to be on our live systems within hours of you pushing\nit. We're also very open to open sourcing code that doesn't contain\nany business logic, I've personally been involved in open sourcing a\nfew of our internal tools, including <a href=\"https://github.com/git-deploy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/git-deploy</a> and\na few CPAN modules.<p>I'd be happy to answer any questions at avarab@gmail.com and/or\nforward your resume, You can also apply directly at\n<a href=\"http://booking.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://booking.com/jobs</a> if you'd prefer.<p>1. Well, not H1B, but we'll take care of the Dutch equivalent. If you\n   are not from the EU we will apply for a work &#38; residence permit for\n   you and your family if needed.","time":1351776541,"type":"comment"}
