We work with major national advertisers, and with 140 banks and three of the top six card issuers. TechCrunch called us the anti-Groupon - we take the hassle out of deals. See how it works at <a href=\"http://www.edointeractive.com/video\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.edointeractive.com/video</a> .<p>From an engineering perspective, we value well-designed, test-driven, service-oriented code. We're looking for people who can act decisively on the challenges they're tackling. Our process is small-a agile; we value both usability and technical design, and technical itches do get scratched here. If you have problem solving skills and an interest in working with rich data, we'd love to hear from you.<p>We use Java, Grails, and JavaScript; Postgres and Hadoop; DevOps and automated testing.<p>Apply at the website above or email michael.doran at edointeractive.com - say you came from HN. Happy to answer questions at jennifer.berk at edointeractive.com (I sit next to the CTO).","time":1351788193,"type":"comment"}
