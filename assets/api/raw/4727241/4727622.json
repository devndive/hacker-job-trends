We’re looking for generalist engineers to join our mobile team.<p>We work primarily in iOS and Android and we use a variety of custom video components. We really like full stack engineers and encourage people to learn new skill sets – our best engineers are comfortable with modifying code on our Wowza, FMS, Ruby on Rails, and Java servers. You can try our website at www.spreecast.com to see the experience we are bringing to mobile apps.<p>We’re most interested in excellent engineers, regardless of which current language/toolset you’re currently using. We believe that excellent engineers can quickly accomplish great things in a language that they don’t already know. So if you’re a longtime C++ engineer that wants to get involved with mobile development, be sure to contact us. Engineers with experience in Android and iOS should definitely apply.<p>Fun Stuff<p>Choose your own engineering setup. For instance I’m writing this on a Retina Macbook Pro with two external monitors and 16GB (!?!) of RAM.<p>We’re expanding our office in NYC to include a full time studio for celebrities to use to create Spreecasts.<p>Our headquarters are in San Francisco so you’ll get to take trips to the Bay Area.<p>About Us<p>We are well funded, have been in beta for 9 months, and have offices in NYC and San Francisco. One of our cofounders, Jeff Fluhr, previously started StubHub and sold it to eBay.<p>Please contact robert@spreecast.com","time":1351779501,"type":"comment"}
