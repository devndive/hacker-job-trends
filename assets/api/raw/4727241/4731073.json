We want to do it with Data and Design in a space that has traditionally lacked in both but is now heating up.<p>Most local businesses resort to unsustainable daily deals or boring Email Marketing to acquire and retain customers. We reject that status quo and our hundreds of (paying) customers agree. We’ve also developed a new search/crawl/tech-centric way of acquiring our own customers and disagree with the obsolete feet-on-street Sales model. The company is very small but generating material and predictable revenue; net revenue growth has exploded in the last quarter.<p>We also just launched with a $5.1M Series A in the press w/ TechCrunch, AllThingsD, GigaOm and VentureBeat (press links below).<p>Talk to us?
