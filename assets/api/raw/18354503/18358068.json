We&#x27;re developing a platform for urban infrastructure planning that combines elements of BIM and GIS, with a focus on agile, real-time collaboration.<p>Weâ€™re looking for a full-stack software engineer to join our growing team. You&#x27;ll be able to make a big impact, joining a small but very enthusiastic team. For this role, you&#x27;ll primarily focus on mathematical problems: computational geometry, parametric constraint solvers, network routing optimisation, etc -- problems that come up in the course of modeling both physical transport infrastructure and transport network simulation and analysis. However you should be enough of a generalist to be unafraid to dive into other areas of the application where needed.<p>Technology-wise, Podaris is built on Javascript&#x2F;ES6, Meteor.js, OpenStreetMap, and OpenLayers. Your expertise with Javascript is more important to us than your experience with the particular libraries that we use. Experience with building large single-page apps is particularly helpful. Experience with Java-based OSM routers (and other associated or similar tooling) is also a strong plus.<p>We&#x27;re based in London, UK, but are open to remote workers from anywhere in the world, provided we can establish a collaborative rapport. Currently we can only offer a six-month contract, but will aim to convert that into a salaried role pending additional funding. Equity is also available for extraordinarily talented individuals.<p>Email jobs@podaris.com, or apply via <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;l&#x2F;2dmXs2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;l&#x2F;2dmXs2</a>","time":1541103938,"type":"comment"}
