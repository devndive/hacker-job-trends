Think pharmaceutical manufacturers, wind farms, and energy companies with tons of equipment and sensors. Our software engineers tackle hard problems in streaming calculation, storage and distributed computing, and we create elegant HTML5 data visualizations with smooth interactivity.<p>Our company is 100% remote and proud of it. You can work anywhere in the US or Europe (we require an overlap of 8am-noon Pacific). We use a variety of collaboration tools, like Zoom and Slack, which makes us feel like we’re in the same building together. We have a stacked team of kind-hearted, talented engineers that love to collaborate, teach each other new tricks, and build products that far exceed our customers’ expectations.<p>Our technology stack is largely Java &#x2F; JVM languages on the backend and TypeScript &#x2F; Angular on the frontend. The core of our product is a full-featured calculation engine that can perform complex math and execute machine learning algorithms on streaming time series data.<p>To apply, go to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seeq.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seeq.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;careers</a><p>I&#x27;m not the hiring manager, but happy to answer any questions.
