Members order over the weekend for pre-scheduled delivery the following Wednesday, Thursday, or Saturday with a 90-minute delivery window.<p>Membership starts at $79&#x2F;year and members generally save ~40% on any purchase. Taxes on cannabis are as high as 38% in certain areas, so by lowering product prices, consumers save a lot of money on taxes too. Our mission is to beat black market prices while offering all the benefits of the regulated market, i.e. pesticide-free tested products, top-notch customer service, and a menu that is always fresh and exciting.<p>We&#x27;re only 6 months old but we are scaling fast. We have 20 billboards up in SF this month and will be expanding across the state within the next 6-12 months.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, please email scarlet@flowercompany.com with your resume.<p>Thank you.","time":1541098100,"type":"comment"}
