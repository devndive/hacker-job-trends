Instead of getting an email about something that has changed in your ATS&#x2F;Jira&#x2F;CRM and then having to click through to take action, we put everything directly in your Gmail inbox and let you take action on it right there. People love us (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;streak-crm-for-gmail&#x2F;pnnfemgpilpdaojpnkjdgfgbnnjojfik?hl=en-US\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;streak-crm-for-gma...</a>), we&#x27;re profitable, and growing.<p>== Engineers (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.streak.com&#x2F;teams&#x2F;engineering\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.streak.com&#x2F;teams&#x2F;engineering</a>) ==<p>We have a very small team but take on large challenges. On the backend we are running the largest Cloud Spanner instance in the world (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;products&#x2F;databases&#x2F;how-streak-built-a-graph-database-on-cloud-spanner-to-wrangle-billions-of-emails\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;products&#x2F;databases&#x2F;how-streak-...</a>). On the front end we built the InboxSDK (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inboxsdk.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inboxsdk.com&#x2F;</a>) to power our Gmail integration and powers other extensions that are used by millions of people everyday. No matter what you&#x27;re interested in you will be challenged, learn, ship and make an impact.<p>== Sales (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.streak.com&#x2F;teams&#x2F;sales\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.streak.com&#x2F;teams&#x2F;sales</a>) ==<p>One of Streak&#x27;s primary use cases is a CRM. As a sales person you have intimate understanding of our customer&#x27;s needs because they&#x27;re your own needs as well. We&#x27;re also in the middle of building an incredible sales engine but it&#x27;s still early and now is the best time to join.<p>== Operations (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.streak.com&#x2F;teams&#x2F;operations\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.streak.com&#x2F;teams&#x2F;operations</a>) ==<p>Join our small team to help grow the company and ensure everybody here is happy. We have a lot of work to do and you&#x27;ll be working directly with a founder (me) and get a fantastic opportunity to grow and accelerate your career. We don&#x27;t like picking just 5 key values because we think we can be great in many dimensions. It&#x27;s hard for sure, but that&#x27;s what makes it fun :)<p>If you have questions, comments, concerns or just want to riff you can reach out to me directly - omar@streak.com","time":1541101276,"type":"comment"}
