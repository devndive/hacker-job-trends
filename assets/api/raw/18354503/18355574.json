We streamline the booking process for buyers and musicians (including their managers and agents) by providing them a single destination to connect, contract, and book live shows. Our premium artist marketplace spans all genres and levels of the music industry, from independent bands and DJs to major headlining artists represented by the biggest talent agencies in the world. We started our marketplace with college buyers (fraternities and sororities) and quickly grew to over 100 colleges around the country. We are now eager to expand into new markets (bars, clubs, and festivals). Mission statement aside, we are a tight-knit team that launched in 2016 and recently raised seed stage capital from angel investors. We are now hiring for two roles to grow our distributed engineering team from 1 (myself, CTO) to 3 engineers.<p>Front end: JS&#x2F;React&#x2F;ReactNative: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;beatgig&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;450621-front-end-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;beatgig&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;450621-front-end-engineer</a>\nBack end: PHP&#x2F;Laravel: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;beatgig&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;450623-back-end-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;beatgig&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;450623-back-end-engineer</a><p>For interested parties: contact myself, cofounder and CTO, andrew [at] beatgig [dot] com","time":1541089430,"type":"comment"}
