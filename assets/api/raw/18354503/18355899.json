We may take into consideration remote working, even though we haven&#x27;t done it yet, but (personally) I like the idea. We are a startup based in north Italy that develops a DB&#x2F;BAAS for storing health data in compliance with EU regulations. We are small but growing, we have received an investment. We work with python and we are going to move quickly to docker &amp; containers (K8s). We do also use Postgres, elastic, Redis, encryption and many more stuff. \nSalary depending on the experience possibility to have shares.<p>More info here <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chino.io&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chino.io&#x2F;careers</a> or carrers@chino.io","time":1541090939,"type":"comment"}
