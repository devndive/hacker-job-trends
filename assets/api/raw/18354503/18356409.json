We’re on a mission to scale our platform while simultaneously improving performance, reliability, and resiliency. To do this, we need the help of dedicated, methodical, and versatile developers!<p>The Service Communication team at Shopify is responsible for defining, coordinating and monitoring all service-to-service network communication at Shopify. As part of the larger Service Patterns group, we work with all Shopifolk to create and maintain a high-reliability network of services that make up the distributed application.<p>Only a few short years ago we had 20 services running all of Shopify and now we have well over 600. We expect that number to increase over the next few years as we add new features and scale our current service to more customers. Creating a resilient platform for service-to-service communication will give us the ability to move fast and <i>not</i> break things.<p>If you&#x27;re into infrastructure &amp; operations (call it Production Engineer, DevOps, whatever) this can be an awesome role.\nWe&#x27;re currently on Kubernetes with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and are exploring Istio as our service mesh (with Envoy Proxy as our sidecar). We&#x27;re also building out client libraries in Ruby, Go and Python.<p>Apply here:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shopify.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;production-engineer-scalability-reliability-rpc-team-0632b4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shopify.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;production-engineer-scalabil...</a><p>- Michael Kipper","time":1541093846,"type":"comment"}
