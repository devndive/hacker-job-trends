Both co-founders are engineers who worked at First Round Capital, Eventbrite, and Digg. We worked together at a top VC firm for 3 years and have a healthy mix of engineering skills + business sense. We’re looking for a unique engineer who is persistent, exploratory, multi-disciplinary, and demonstrates leadership.<p>Command E helps provides effortless, lightning-fast navigation of your chaotic workspace. Command E lets you instantly search your cloud data (i.e. Google Drive, Salesforce, Trello&#x2F;Asana, Dropbox&#x2F;Box, wikis, and more). We’re bringing the “fuzzy finder” file-switching experience of vi&#x2F;Emacs&#x2F;IDEs to business people. Our unique technology searches across many cloud providers and displays results as you type, in less than 10ms.<p>Our stack is Electron&#x2F;React&#x2F;Redux&#x2F;SQLite. We’re using ES6, async&#x2F;await, Promises, and all the cool new JavaScript stuff, but the search index is backed by rock-solid native SQLite&#x2F;C++. From a technical perspective there&#x27;s tons of fun space to explore—high-performance full-text search indexing, fast async UIs, modern dev frameworks, encryption, or deploying cross-platform desktop apps.<p>We&#x27;re at 3rd &amp; Market in San Francisco and have legendary VC&#x2F;angel investors. We met each other 4 years ago through a &quot;Who&#x27;s Hiring?” thread, so we&#x27;re excited to see who responds to this one!<p>There isn&#x27;t much publicly available about us yet, but email benstandefer at gmail dot com and I&#x27;ll share all the details.","time":1541096709,"type":"comment"}
