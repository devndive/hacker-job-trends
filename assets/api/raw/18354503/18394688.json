In Rwanda, 9.5 million people or 81% of the population cannot access mains electricity, which has a negative impact on quality of life and limits people&#x27;s chances of achieving economic prosperity.<p>BBOXX is helping to address this issue by providing off-grid communities in developing countries with affordable solar energy solutions. BBOXX customers typically use a Pay-As-You-Go payment method, which enables very low income customers access to electricity at home that they would otherwise not be able to afford. To date BBOXX has installed more than 150,000 solar systems and provided around 750,000 people with access to energy.<p>Check out our impact here <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bboxx.co.uk&#x2F;customers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bboxx.co.uk&#x2F;customers&#x2F;</a>","time":1541536506,"type":"comment"}
