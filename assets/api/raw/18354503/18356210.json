The job listing is for the international team based out of SF. Right now there is great adoption in China and we are trying to make this amazing technology available to the rest of the world [1].<p>Our tech stack is Go, Rust, Kubernetes, and TiDB.\nYou can work on making an amazing cloud product or do low-level database hacking, depending on your skill set.<p>I like working on TiDB because I get to be a part of a big change going on in databases and work with a highly-skilled results oriented team that works well together. I am continually learning new things, but I get to both make an impact by applying my existing experience.<p>See the jobs page for compensation.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;11&#x2F;tidb-developer-pingcap-wants-to-expand-in-north-america-after-raising-50m-series-c&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;11&#x2F;tidb-developer-pingcap-wan...</a>","time":1541092705,"type":"comment"}
