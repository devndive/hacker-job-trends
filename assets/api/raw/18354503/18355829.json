We are a home for freelancers&#x2F;contractors and we have several openings.<p>Facet Development is a freelancer network made up exclusively of ex-FAANG engineers. Facet does the work of finding freelancing jobs&#x2F;projects and then we send them out to the devs in the network. We also provide project management and billing&#x2F;collections, help with taxes, etc, so freelancers get to spend a lot more of their time doing the enjoyable parts of freelancing and not trying to run a small business.<p>We target FAANG companies and companies that wish they could hire FAANG devs when finding work for our freelancer network. When I was a dev lead at Microsoft, bringing on vendors or outsourcing was a terrible experience, because they always seemed to be below our hiring bar. So I started Facet to solve the problem I had when I was an engineering manager at a FAANG company.<p>If you are a FAANG or ex-FAANG dev that wants to switch to freelancing or already is, you should join: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facetdev.com&#x2F;developer-network\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facetdev.com&#x2F;developer-network</a><p>You can read more about the Facet Developer Network here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facetdev.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-facet-developer-network-th..\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facetdev.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-facet-developer-network-th...</a>.","time":1541090641,"type":"comment"}
