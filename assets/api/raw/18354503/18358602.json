Synthesis could eventually enable access to code for non-programmers. For now, goal is simple: My customers give me source code for their contract (= Ethereum apps, which are self-contained). I use synthesis to generate another contract&#x2F;app that demonstrates any problematic interaction.<p>Backed by Y Combinator, Khosla Ventures and Pantera Capital. We have paying customers, with a backlog waiting to be on-boarded, and are profitable.<p>Ideal candidate will have a MS or PhD in program synthesis, formal methods or related fields.
