Box is heavily invested in creating frameworks and infrastructure for automated testing, and becoming an industry leader in software quality and best practices. So far, this responsibility has been directly on the product development engineers. We are now hiring a strong technical leader to define and hands-on spearhead the construction of what automated testing is going to mean for us.<p>Box has an incredible culture that empowers, allows space for creativity and encourages taking initiative and ownership.<p>The person we will hire needs to be a strong software engineer with passion for testing and automation. If you think that test frameworks development is second-class coding, I recommend you take a look at the design of libraries like go-vcr. Pure genius.<p>Email me directly at eddie@box.com with your resume and let&#x27;s talk!<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;boxinc&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;1347214\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;boxinc&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;1347214</a>","time":1541087153,"type":"comment"}
