It&#x27;s orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the &quot;Usain Bolt of cyberÂ­security&quot; [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].<p>The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is &quot;game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes.&quot; [3]<p>Tanium has a strong engineering culture and takes really good care of it&#x27;s employees. E.g. team gatherings (3~4&#x2F;year) leave Monday and Friday open for travel rather than taking half your weekend.<p>Fortune featured us as one of the Best Small and Medium Workplaces [4], partially based on the Great Place to Work survey, which gave us top marks for challenges, atmosphere, rewards, pride, and communication [5].<p>Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed&#x2F;unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.<p>Compensation is near FAANG levels with base, bonus, and RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.<p>We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.<p>Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].<p>--<p>Senior Software Engineer - The core is mostly C++, and then JavaScript for the modules and admin interface (AngularJS&#x2F;Node.js, with work in progress to switch to React). There&#x27;s also growing amounts of Python, particularly for endpoint scripting, and a tiny bit of Rust.<p>On site or US Remote (pick the closest one) - SF: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;ixfioowp1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;ixfioowp1</a> | RTP: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;bxio4pg51\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;bxio4pg51</a><p>--<p>Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn&#x27;t have any real parallels that I&#x27;m aware of. As a TAM, you&#x27;d be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you&#x27;d be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.<p>(Note: &quot;Director&quot; is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)<p>Remote or on site in Canada, France, UK, or USA.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tanium.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;?p=department&amp;t=Technical%20Account%20Management&amp;gh_src=r64ytqkl1#jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tanium.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;?p=department&amp;t=Technical%20A...</a><p>--<p>Systems Engineer (SF) - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;c3cf52141\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;c3cf52141</a><p>Security Engineer (US Remote): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;oghwvo2u1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;oghwvo2u1</a><p>Lots more: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tanium.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;?gh_src=qprker8f1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tanium.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;?gh_src=qprker8f1</a><p>--<p>[1]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fortune.com&#x2F;most-important-private-companies&#x2F;tanium-24&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fortune.com&#x2F;most-important-private-companies&#x2F;tanium-2...</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;companies&#x2F;tanium&#x2F;#3bbe09173eea\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;companies&#x2F;tanium&#x2F;#3bbe09173eea</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fedscoop.com&#x2F;air-force-cio-says-role-become-much-prominent-prepares-retire&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fedscoop.com&#x2F;air-force-cio-says-role-become-much...</a><p>[4]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fortune.com&#x2F;best-medium-workplaces&#x2F;tanium-55&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fortune.com&#x2F;best-medium-workplaces&#x2F;tanium-55&#x2F;</a><p>[5]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;reviews.greatplacetowork.com&#x2F;tanium\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;reviews.greatplacetowork.com&#x2F;tanium</a>","time":1541107634,"type":"comment"}
