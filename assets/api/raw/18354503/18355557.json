The mechanism that supports this is counterintuitive but once grasped will genuinely change the way you think about blockchain. We are proud to be supported by the smartest people in Asia:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@SaitoOfficial&#x2F;saito-raises-2-million-usd..\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@SaitoOfficial&#x2F;saito-raises-2-million-usd...</a>.<p>We are currently looking to hire a network engineer who can assist with network rollout and scaling, as well as an application developer (NodeJS, HTML+CSS) to help polish data-intensive distributed applications (think email, reddit, facebook, etc. on a blockchain). Things you should know about us are that we are a smaller team based in Asia (currently Beijing, eyeing Singapore) and will need anyone who joins us to spend a non-trivial amount of time with us physically this coming year, although some time elsewhere is also fine.<p>Saito is an adventure worth taking. If you are interested please send us an email at dsvid@saito.tech or message me directly here on Hacker News.","time":1541089325,"type":"comment"}
