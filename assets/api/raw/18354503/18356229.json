Caper differentiates from technologies like Amazon Go by creating a plug-and-play solution that does not require store renovation, operational overhaul, heavy compute and endless image labeling &amp; training; retailers can just buy the carts, and the entire store is upgraded with cashier-less capabilities. Caper costs less than 1% of Amazon Go&#x27;s infrastructure, and it is already actively being used in the market.<p>Caper is currently backed by First Round Capital, Y Combinator, and top executives from Instacart, Plated, Albertsons and Walmart.<p>We’re a team of incredibly motivated individuals looking to put a dent in the retail industry. We are looking for a founding employee who will add to our talented technical team. You’ll be directly working under the CTO and the opportunity offers plenty of room for rapid internal growth.<p>View <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.caper.ai&#x2F;backend-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.caper.ai&#x2F;backend-engineer</a> for more details, or message us at jobs@caper.ai if you have any questions or just want grab a coffee!","time":1541092797,"type":"comment"}
