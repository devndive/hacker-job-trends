We do this today by building and operating the top marketplace connecting customers who need help lifting, loading, and transporting big and bulky items with local pickup truck owners who can help them. We put the customer in control of their experience – when and how a pick up&#x2F;delivery happens, how much help they need, total visibility into what is actually going on in real-time – all wrapped in an incredible customer experience.<p>You’ll be working on things ranging from the backend for our apps to our platform and tooling. Projects may include: building endpoints for the apps, working on proprietary algorithms for things like fulfillment and pricing, and helping to build out tools for our Operations Team to succeed. We work focused on deadline driven results within an agile methodology.<p>Stack:<p>- Node.js<p>- React web<p>- Mongo<p>Send me a note with [HN] in the subject line to chad@dolly.com","time":1541096447,"type":"comment"}
