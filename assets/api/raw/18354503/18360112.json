We program surveys insanely fast for private equity and management consulting clients. I (the founder) am looking for someone to help support the crazy growth and do some of the &quot;things that don&#x27;t scale.&quot; (Mostly helping clients with their surveys and dealing with partners)<p>Ideal background is a mix of business knowledge and programming experience, though the role is flexible if you&#x27;re more of one or the other. This is a great opportunity to learn more about PE and consulting if you&#x27;re coming from a tech background or learn more about tech if you&#x27;re coming from a business background.<p>hn@inc-query.com","time":1541123756,"type":"comment"}
