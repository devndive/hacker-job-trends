(INTERN POSITIONS OPEN, and H1B available)<p><a href=\"http://www.nutonian.com/company/careers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nutonian.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a><p>Thats the list of currently available positions, but in particular, we really, REALLY need another Front End Dev. Being that I am the only one, I need someone to work with me! You would have a ton of input in terms of the look and feel of the application, and how we architect it.<p>Currently, we are using Backbone, Pure CSS, Handlebars, Grunt, and Casper and Phantom for CI.<p>A little background on the company: Nutonian is changing the way people interact with their data to understand the hidden mathematical relationships there. Backed by Atlas Ventures we are very well funded (Series A was announced last Wed, a $4m deal) and in a unique position to capitalize on the convergence of trends in big data and machine learning.<p>Our core technology, built upon years of academic research at Cornell University, automatically finds all the interesting relationships in data sets. Our current products have been used by over 30,000 people, a testament to its power and commercial reach. Our team is still small - everyone has a large impact, knows the CEO personally, and will create and own the core technology components that make up our company&#x27;s product. Like other high performance teams, while we work hard, we also play hard with regular company meals, dinners, and social outings.<p>Contact me if you want to know more about the positions, nick@nutonian.com<p>Thanks!","time":1383316631,"type":"comment"}
