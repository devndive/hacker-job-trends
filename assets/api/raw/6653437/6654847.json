Currently looking for a Python developer, Video Streaming Engineer, iOS developer and UI&#x2F;UX designer, all full-time in London. We&#x27;re based at Google Campus.<p>I&#x27;m including the links with the usual job description blurb below, just wanted to say that we&#x27;re a well funded one year old company, with product prototype ready, now approaching first public release. It&#x27;s seven of us, with three people located in London. These will be our first hires, so your influence on the end product is only limited by your own capacity. For the same reason we&#x27;re super serious about picking the right people and should we find them, ready to treat them <i>very</i> well with interesting engineering tasks and cookies. It&#x27;s great to work here, really.<p>===<p>Video Streaming Engineer: <a href=\"http://workinstartups.com/job-board/job/7965/video-streaming-engineer-at-fountain-digital-labs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;workinstartups.com&#x2F;job-board&#x2F;job&#x2F;7965&#x2F;video-streaming...</a><p>Python Developer: <a href=\"http://workinstartups.com/job-board/job/7961/senior-python-developer-for-video-delivery-platform-at-fountain-digital-labs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;workinstartups.com&#x2F;job-board&#x2F;job&#x2F;7961&#x2F;senior-python-d...</a><p>iOS Developer: <a href=\"http://workinstartups.com/job-board/job/7962/senior-ios-developer-for-interactive-video-app-at-fountain-digital-labs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;workinstartups.com&#x2F;job-board&#x2F;job&#x2F;7962&#x2F;senior-ios-deve...</a>","time":1383325039,"type":"comment"}
