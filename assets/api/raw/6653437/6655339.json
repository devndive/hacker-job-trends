Our team is a bunch of geeks who love building the most awesomest domain management service on Earth.<p>So let&#x27;s have fun() and play with all the nice stuff you always wanted to play with. We&#x27;ve built a stack here at iwantmyname that is both flexible and fun, and we&#x27;re in need of another hacker to help us turn it into a beauty.<p>We&#x27;re currently using modern Perl, Erlang, Coffee Script, Lua, CouchDB, RabbitMQ, Redis, Kyoto Tycoon, Puppet, Vagrant and are looking at a whole lot of new toys to build the best possible experience for our customers.<p>So if you&#x27;ve run up against company policies around $favorite_toy in production, join us and see it scale or die in flames. If you introduce technology that is not up to scratch yet, put some time aside to contribute back to that project to get it where we need it.<p>We love open source, we contribute a lot and we want you to be actively contributing to projects or talking at conferences to share your knowledge with the community.<p>If this sounds like you, fire up a console window and get in touch by doing the following dig lookup:<p>dig TXT jobs.iwantmyname.com","time":1383329498,"type":"comment"}
