But many more millions still walk into a tax store. You will be joining the small team of successful startup people that are disrupting the multi-billion dollar tax industry with their first product, TurboTax CPA Select. The service provides high quality tax help at a fraction of the price of a tax store by allowing consumers to connect with quality tax professionals online. The unique team is heavily financed by Intuit---makers of TurboTax, Quickbooks, and Mint---while still living and breathing “lean startup” to ultimately build a service anyone can use.<p>Email: cpaselect-CPSL0193@applications.recruiterbox.com<p>If you want to reach me directly, feel free to contact me from my HN profile","time":1383312209,"type":"comment"}
