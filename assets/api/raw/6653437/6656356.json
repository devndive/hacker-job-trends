We are looking for four software engineers for various positions in the company: one in QA, one in financial engineering, and two for application work. None of these positions require you to manage other people. All of them are up at <a href=\"http://www.smartleaf.com/about/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smartleaf.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;careers</a> for your perusal.<p>You should be clever, competent, and kind.<p>Experience requirements: fluency in two or more languages (the application is in C++ (back end) and Ruby on Rails (front end)). You don&#x27;t need to know C++ or Ruby, but you&#x27;ll need to learn them. Some people use R for the sorts of thing one uses R for; lots of our internal tools are written in Perl. You must have the ability and desire to track down complex problems and solve them, learning as you go. Strong written and verbal communications skills are essential.<p>Nice-to-haves include experience with databases (Oracle or PostgreSQL, especially) or data feed engineering or being particularly good at math.<p>Full-time, on-site positions with occasional telecommuting. Compensation includes salary, equity, 3-4 weeks of vacation, NYSE holidays, all insurance premiums, food, excellent coffee, and a collegial working environment.<p>An ex-employee described us as the most interesting group of people he had found outside of MIT. It probably helps if you&#x27;re an SF fan. As this is HN, I shall shamelessly namedrop: our CTO is Mark Nitzberg, who was at ViaWeb with PG.<p>Cover letters and resumes to jobs@smartleaf.com; we prefer plain text or PDF. In your cover letter, please describe an interesting problem you have solved.","time":1383339355,"type":"comment"}
