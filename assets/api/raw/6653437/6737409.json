We created RedLaser, 360 Panorama, and the the Structure Sensor, the latter raising over $1.2 million on Kickstarter earlier this year. We run on coffee, think in pixels, and fight for milliseconds (and millimeters). We have really good benefits including health, dental and an HSA. We provide equity to all employees. Also, money.<p>You:<p>You are a person. You are meticulous and forward-thinking. You&#x27;re up on The New. You are opinionated but your ego is in check. You use Python every day, or almost every day. You know various sorts of databases, of which Postgres is one. You take your tools seriously and want to work on a small team building some crazy exciting tech. You do things the right way becuase it&#x27;s the right way, not because someone is looking over your shoulder. You take complicated things and make them simple, and elegant.<p>We don&#x27;t want a ninja, or a rockstar, we want someone who cares about the work. If this is you, then let&#x27;s talk.
