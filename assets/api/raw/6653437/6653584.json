We are currently using GWT (Java) and MySQL with some scripting in Python and deploy to a Linux (CentOS) environment. We will need you to rapidly be productive with these tools if you are not familiar with them already. Additionally, you&#x27;ll help us grow our team over the next few months as we continue to add engineers.<p>A willingness to learn is more important to us than a Biology background, but the position will require you to become familiar with the Biology that underlies what we do.<p>About the company\nWe write software to help clinicians interpret exome sequence data from their patients. To do this, we aggregate large amounts of additional data on individual genes and variants, and apply a series of proprietary algorithms. Weâ€™re a young company (founded in March 2013) that is profitable with our existing customers and continuing to grow.","time":1383313059,"type":"comment"}
