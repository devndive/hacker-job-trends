The company was founded in 2009 and   initially focused on content from Asia, but has recently expanded into providing Spanish language programming as well.  Partners include Hulu.<p>DramaFever&#x27;s engineering team is currently seeking Full Stack and Back-end Developers (Python, Go, Django, Redis, AWS), Linux sysadmins, Devops pros, and Android developers.<p>Technology decisions are made for the right reasons at DramaFever, recognizing that sometimes right includes &quot;what would be most interesting&quot; -- our image processors and some analytics pieces are now Go.  We&#x27;ve got a mandate to be &quot;available everywhere&quot;, which means we&#x27;re on or soon to be on every major mobile OS and every home theater platform.<p>The backend stack is ever evolving with new services and tools being added all the time.  We use a 3rd party service when it&#x27;s cost efficient and sufficiently flexible and build stand-alone in house services when that makes the most sense.  Our level of automation is quite high with chef+vagrant and per-dev micro-instances for development, Jenkins built docker containers for deployments, and autoscaling in place for all production services.<p>Our development practices are always being refined -- last week we eliminated timesheets. We spec in google docs, keep code and issues in Github, and review (all) code in pull requests.  IRC is for engineering battlestations or deciding from where we&#x27;ll order lunch.  Pick your own editor, OS, browser, and tooling so long as you know how to configure its whitespace settings.","time":1383318271,"type":"comment"}
