We are currently on the hunt for Python developers of all levels, especially those with a more creative side.  We don&#x27;t put our developers in a box, but expect them to be involved from strategy to delivery, working collaboratively with the entire team to find unique solutions to some amazing briefs.  To help facilitate this we have our own bar in the office (with no locks on the fridge!) and the cupboards are always stocked with snacks and treats.<p>A small sample of the technologies, languages and frameworks we use include AngularJS, Three.js, Django, Python and Google App Engine.<p>Some recent projects we&#x27;ve worked on include a Google Cardboard VR Experience for Mont Blanc (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phantom.land&#x2F;work&#x2F;mont-blanc&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phantom.land&#x2F;work&#x2F;mont-blanc&#x2F;</a>) and an interactive piece for the TATE Modern featuring music by Sigur RÃ³s (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phantom.land&#x2F;work&#x2F;states-of-matter&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phantom.land&#x2F;work&#x2F;states-of-matter&#x2F;</a>).<p>Please check out our site (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phantom.land\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phantom.land</a>) for more info.
