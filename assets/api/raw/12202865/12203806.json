Our mission is to help bring the 4 billion people online who are without internet. And to pull it off we have to reinvent 30 GHz radios in space using SDRs.<p>Work with incredibly smart people who have flown things in space before. Well-funded, but still a very small team that moves fast. No prior space experience needed, you just need to enjoy getting your hands dirty with real hardware and be ok with struggling to do things that seem impossibly hard.<p>Roles we’re hiring for include:<p>* Electrical -- PCB design, layout, bringup, test. Bonus: experience with fault-tolerant electronics, power systems, or high speed digital design<p>* Mechanical -- design, build, and test deployables and mechanisms. Should be experienced in stress and thermal analysis<p>* Aerospace&#x2F;controls -- implement solutions to 6 DOF, non-linear control problems. Experience with spacecraft controls is a plus but not required.<p>* RF&#x2F;Microwave -- work across a broad range including microwave system-level design, RF PCB design, and antenna design, simulation, and characterization.<p>* DSP&#x2F;FPGA -- program FPGA hardware, develop custom DSP IP cores and integrate off-the-shelf IP cores<p>Please email john@astranis.com if you’re interested in learning more.","time":1470069600,"type":"comment"}
