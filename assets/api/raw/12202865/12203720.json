{"by":"jtwarren","id":12203720,"parent":12202865,"text":"Wellframe | Healthcare | Boston, Ma | Onsite&#x2F;Fulltime<p>At Wellframe, we are building an intelligent care-management platform that allows health plans and care-delivery organizations to better manage large populations of complex patients. Because the most clinically complicated cases in a patient population tend to drive a majority of the costs, even seemingly small improvements in these patientsâ€™ well-being have dramatic benefits for the care provider. Wellframe focuses on improving patient health by providing personalized and adaptive care programs for people trying to recover from or manage serious health problems. We use the health data we collect in order to intelligently allot care resources to the specific needs of patients, paying special attention to the most-critical patients. Through clinical studies and working with large healthcare payers, we have seen that our platform improves patient outcomes, increases the capacity of care management teams and reduces costs of the care provider.<p>We have a relatively small engineering team at about 10 engineers. What makes us unique is that we have a full time clinical team (mostly MDs) that work with us to break down clinical science so that we can build it back up into personalized and adaptive care programs. We&#x27;re currently looking for several senior engineering positions (android, frontend, infra) across our engineering team. More descriptions can be found on our jobs page (below). If you&#x27;re in the area I&#x27;d love to just grab coffee regardless of whether or not you&#x27;re actively looking to move -- I love talking to other passionate, driven people about what they do.<p>For those interested in some specifics: We have Android, iOS, and web (backbone, react) products. We&#x27;re currently running most of our API on Rails but heavily migrating toward Scala for most of our backend&#x2F;data services. Other keywords in case someone is searching: Spark, Spark Streaming, Akka, Python, Mesos.<p>Jobs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wellframe.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wellframe.com&#x2F;jobs</a>\nAlso feel free to reach out to me at jeff@wellframe.com!","time":1470068968,"type":"comment"}
