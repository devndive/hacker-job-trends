We&#x27;re looking for help with our Angular 2&#x2F;Typescript web interfaces.  One interface is on the instrument itself (it has a touchscreen that runs full-screen chrome), and the other is a web page that customers use to run analyses on the data that comes off of the instrument.  Both are single-page apps that talk to our backends over JSON APIs.<p>We launched a new instrument late last year, and we&#x27;re growing.  Many of our users are labs that do biological research, but there are also some human clinical use cases that our technology is a good fit for.  So we&#x27;re working with a partner to get the instrument ready for clinical use as well.<p>We&#x27;re a very interdisciplinary company; there&#x27;s serious physics, chemistry, biology, and computer science going on.  There are so many different kinds of nerd jokes, I can&#x27;t even tell you.<p>The interview process is a phone screen, a coding challenge, and an on-site interview.
