Lots of companies I&#x27;ve contacted that do remote hiring seem to hire from within a certain radius of timezones.<p>If anyone needs a backend engineer, I have just above a year of experience working at a prominent startup. The startup mostly has computer vision people with no engineering experience so I practically built their analytics platform, the backend for their dashboard and processing pipeline, and some VR&#x2F;AR applications in Unity. Most of the above, I learned myself and got productive very quickly. \narsalanahmad [dot] ars [at] gmail","time":1470114229,"type":"comment"}
