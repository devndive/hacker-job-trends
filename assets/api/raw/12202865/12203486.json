Then we&#x27;re building financial apps on top, because finance is the industry that can benefit from this technology the most. Many startups in this space are building on top of the Nakamoto blockchain algorithm, but we don&#x27;t actually use a Bitcoin-style blockchain at all: that&#x27;s why we simply call what we&#x27;re building the <i>distributed ledger</i> instead.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a mix of sharp computer science generalists and people with experience in finance and banking. We are pushing the boundaries in VM and compiler technology, cryptography, systems programming, networking and fintech. Most of our software is written in Kotlin on the JVM (sort of a simplified Scala), but you don&#x27;t need to know Kotlin: you can learn on the job.<p>Although the job ad says ONSITE, we are open to remote working if you&#x27;re the right candidate.<p>Email me: mike@r3cev.com","time":1470067543,"type":"comment"}
