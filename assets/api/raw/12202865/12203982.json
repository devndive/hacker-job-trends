We take great pride in our design and development, only working on projects we build from the ground up handling design, brand, and development.<p>We are looking for another backend developer who is flexible and willing to work with an small existing team in a fully remote capacity. The key trait we are looking for is independence and self-motivation to tackle problems and hit deadlines. Experience with frontend development and a eye for implementing designs as per mockups&#x2F;etc is a huge plus but not mandatory.<p>We currently work with MeteorJS as our primary framework and while experience with this is a big benefit, it&#x27;s easy to pickup so if you don&#x27;t have much experience, still feel free to reach out! Generally looking for experience with NodeJS, MongoDB, Angular&#x2F;React&#x2F;Vue, etc.<p>The goal is to find someone who can jump in as part-time and work on ramping their hours up from there. We are looking for someone available immediately. If interested definitely reach out with availability (hours per week), hourly rate, and past experience!<p>Contact: austin [at] wonderkiln.com<p>Looking forward to hearing from some of you!","time":1470070678,"type":"comment"}
