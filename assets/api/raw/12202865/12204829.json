For example, we have used these techniques to map contamination, in real-time, in 3-D in Fukushima, Japan. We integrate LiDAR and visual sensors with gamma-ray detectors on handheld and aerial platforms (UAVs).<p>We are looking for an engineer who is interested in working with computer vision sensors. This can include: building multi-sensor packages with small computers, designing and implementing algorithms and analyzing data. We use ROS, Linux and scientific Python. Some interest&#x2F;background in physics could be helpful.\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lbl.taleo.net&#x2F;careersection&#x2F;2&#x2F;jobdetail.ftl?lang=en&amp;job=82750\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lbl.taleo.net&#x2F;careersection&#x2F;2&#x2F;jobdetail.ftl?lang=en&amp;...</a>","time":1470076932,"type":"comment"}
