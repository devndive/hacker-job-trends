Since then, we&#x27;ve been working with the government to improve the services HealthCare.gov provides. Our revamped Healthcare.gov application is used by millions, converts 35% better, and halves the completion time.<p>It turns out there’s a lot more to build, and it’s surprising how much can be done by a small group of empathetic people with a Silicon Valley mindset, deep technical experience, working closely with dedicated civil servants in government.<p>We’ve started Nava as a public benefit corporation to radically improve how our government serves its people, and we believe that the services our government provides should be clear and reliable.
