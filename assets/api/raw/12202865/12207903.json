As an early team member, you’ll have significant input and influence on projects like a shared component library for UI development; tooling to make it easy for engineers to spin up and build new client­-side applications; common systems for measuring and monitoring application performance; and more. You’ll evangelize front­-end best practices to teams around the world, help them incorporate those practices into their development workflow, and take your learnings back to the front­-end systems team to develop new tools. You’ll also help identify and mentor individual developers throughout the organization who will be the ultimate source of the front­-end systems team’s success. Your work will increase the velocity of every developer who touches client­-side code; it will impact hundreds of millions of job seekers around the world; it will — quite literally — change the face of Indeed.<p>---<p>The interview process will include a screening exercise and, for successful candidates, a day of on-site interviews. The process will focus specifically on identifying candidates with the required technical and communication skills necessary for the role; expect to talk about vanilla JS, maintainable CSS, client-side performance, testing client-side applications, designing and developing front-end systems to be used across projects, and communicating effectively with technical and non-technical audiences.<p>---<p>More information: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indeed.jobs&#x2F;career&#x2F;JobDetail&#x2F;Front-End-Engineer-Systems&#x2F;920\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indeed.jobs&#x2F;career&#x2F;JobDetail&#x2F;Front-End-Engineer-S...</a>","time":1470113671,"type":"comment"}
