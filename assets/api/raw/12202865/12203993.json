The main focus is on UI&#x2F;UX Designer but with a talent for illustration to aid in crafting assets and moving the experience forward.<p>Similar to the dev opportunity above, the main focus is on independence and hitting deadlines while having almost complete free-reign! The projects will vary quite a bit so looking for someone flexible to jump between projects but who is also quite capable with regards to Web and App design w&#x2F; illustration.<p>Design-wise we have a small group already but are looking to expand it with someone very focused and dedicated time-wise. Happy to share our existing designs&#x2F;buildouts upon request!<p>Like the dev opportunity above, we are looking for someone to jump in as part-time and work on ramping their hours up from there. We are looking for someone available immediately. If interested definitely reach out with availability (hours per week), hourly rate, and design examples!<p>Contact: austin [at] wonderkiln.com<p>Looking forward to hearing from some of you!","time":1470070741,"type":"comment"}
