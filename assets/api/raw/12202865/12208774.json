Our basic business model is to take a 10% commission from jobs that occur over out platform, undercutting the 40% (or more) that agencies charge. We&#x27;ve already got transactions happening, and have received overwhelmingly positive response from the industry.<p>We&#x27;re looking to hire engineer #3 to help us continue to build our platform. Right now we&#x27;re particularly interested in finding someone who has front-end web development experience, but you would also be working on every aspect of our product. Our company has tremendous potential to serve the $50B+ global fashion market, and we&#x27;re looking for someone very motivated to create an awesome product and to impact the company&#x27;s success. Compensation is, of course, very competitive.<p>If interested, contact me at kevin at swipecast dot com.","time":1470131055,"type":"comment"}
