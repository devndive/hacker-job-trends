We&#x27;re a small team (11 engineers) at a profitable, non-VC-funded company. There&#x27;s little bureaucracy, engineers get to take ownership for all aspects of their projects, and there&#x27;s room for good ideas to come from anywhere.<p>We&#x27;re currently working on some very fun technical projects to build a new platform for our site. There are a lot of interesting problems: splitting a problematic current codebase into small Ruby services, writing JavaScript domain models with Flow type-checking, and traditional web UI product work.<p>Best of all, it&#x27;s a low-stress, blame-free team, with just three standups a week in synchronous meetings. Other than that, I get to set my own hours, walk my kids to school, take a long lunch break with my wife, and do good work from anywhere.<p>Questions?
