You probably know us for many reasons ;-), but some of the best ones include our awesome mobile apps (Fantasy Sports, Finance, Sports, Video Guide, Weather, et al).<p>In our New York office, we&#x27;ve got a crack team of mobile designers and developers, and we&#x27;re looking to grow even more. We work mostly on the Finance app&#x2F;site and Video platforms and apps (Yahoo Video Guide, check it out!). I personally manage the mobile video engineers, who have built the Video SDK (video player in all Yahoo apps), Yahoo Video Guide, some secret Android TV &amp; tvOS stuff, Yahoo Screen iOS&#x2F;Android, and more.<p>Perks: free food, hackdays, team outings, working with some of the smartest folks in the industry.<p>If you&#x27;re an Android, iOS, or Backend developer (or any combination thereof), get in touch with me at nano@yahoo-inc.com.","time":1470065188,"type":"comment"}
