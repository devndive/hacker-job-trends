We’re the leading mobile Bitcoin wallet, and need a few more hands to help us achieve our vision: to be the onramp to Bitcoin.<p>Our team is a group of Bitcoin enthusiasts. We’re geographically distributed across the US and Canada, with a central office in San Francisco, CA. You’ll be working directly with me, @ssutch, to build out features that allow our users to purchase and sell bitcoin directly within the app. We believe this is the next most important step for breadwallet to truly achieve our vision of being the onramp for bitcoin.<p>The most important skillset for this job is React&#x2F;Redux. Candidates must have a firm understanding of how React&#x2F;Redux apps are built and must have worked on them in the past. We have a lightweight HTML5 runtime that is hosted inside our native wallet software. This provides an environment for us to develop quickly, while sandboxing the development from the underlying sensitive financial software.<p>Our HTML5 team is young, and so far it’s just been me with occasional help from some contractors. You’ll get the opportunity to shape how our HTML5 team evolves into the future.<p>Experience with iOS&#x2F;Swift and Android&#x2F;Java is definitely a bonus, but myself and our Android developer will assist there whenever necessary. Everyone at breadwallet is a polyglot and you are definitely encouraged to try, and learn, new things!<p>Here are some bullet points:<p>* Full benefits package\n* Work remotely\n* New hardware when you need it\n* Travel to SF once a year for our team on-site\n* Unlimited vacation<p>You can email your resume to me sam@breadwallet.com","time":1470069409,"type":"comment"}
