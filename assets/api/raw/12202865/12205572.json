Our mission is to make all the worldâ€™s art accessible to anyone with an Internet connection.<p>I&#x27;m engineering lead for our auction products. I manage three talented full-stack engineers and I&#x27;m looking to hire an experienced engineer [1] to augment our team.<p>We&#x27;re a small team within the broader Artsy engineering team, but we manage a lot of software, including dedicated auction infrastructure and parts of larger projects devoted to auctions. On our team, engineers spearhead the delivery of functionality, bringing in other engineers and stakeholders as necessary. So there&#x27;s a lot of opportunity to make a big individual impact within a very collaborative environment.<p>We&#x27;re polyglot, and our tech stack includes Javascript (React, Redux, Express), Scala (Akka, Slick), Ruby (Rails, Grape), and Swift. Previous experience is nice, but a demonstrated willingness and ability to learn new tech is even better, since engineering is a moving target!<p>Application: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.artsy.net&#x2F;article&#x2F;artsy-jobs-full-stack-software-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.artsy.net&#x2F;article&#x2F;artsy-jobs-full-stack-software...</a><p>Contact: alan@artsy.net<p>[1] Past experience consistent with 3 or higher on our compensation framework (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;artsy.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;03&#x2F;artsy-engineering-compensation-framework&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;artsy.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;03&#x2F;artsy-engineering-com...</a>)","time":1470082786,"type":"comment"}
