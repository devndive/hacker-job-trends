You&#x27;ll have opportunities to travel there and probably take part in at least one work retreat somewhere in France.<p>WE&#x27;RE LOOKING FOR a recent graduate, motivated student or self-taught developer who is anxious to improve the experience of our users, has an interest in interface design and UX, and will help us make our website and apps a delight to use.

A satisfactory internship might lead to a permanent position.<p>We&#x27;re open to part-time remote work once you&#x27;re established in the team.
