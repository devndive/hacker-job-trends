If everyone on a mission to do good had the power to do even more. That’s why we come to work every day—to equip and connect the world’s philanthropic community so that good can take over.<p>We do that by building the most innovative software and services to help our customers raise more money, spend less, and do more good. And while we each have different roles to play in helping customers succeed, we all have at least one thing in common: We care about cause as much as we care about code. Won’t you join us?<p>We&#x27;re looking for a front-end engineer to help build a web portal that allows donors to make grants to non-profits. Looking for someone that knows Angular well and can help grow the skills of other team members. We use Slack throughout the day, VSTS for work items and builds, Azure and AWS for deployment, Github for code repos.<p>Email me if you&#x27;re interested: dustin.speer@blackbaud.com.<p>Official job application: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blackbaud.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;ExternalCareers&#x2F;job&#x2F;Charleston-Fairchild---South-Carolina---USA&#x2F;Front-End-Engineer_R0000316-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blackbaud.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;ExternalCareer...</a>","time":1470066616,"type":"comment"}
