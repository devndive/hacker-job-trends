Most of all we look for those interested in learning.<p>Please send us:<p><pre><code>  * cover letter — tell us why you’re interested,\n  * resume&#x2F;linkedin profile,\n  * link to github projects or other work samples.\n</code></pre>\nEmail your resume to kirasystems@applications.recruiterbox.com with &quot;Web Developer&quot; in the subject line or apply online at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kirasystems.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kirasystems.com&#x2F;careers</a>.","time":1470069245,"type":"comment"}
