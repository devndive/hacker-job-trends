We&#x27;re a startup â€” we have 12 people and have been working on this for a little over a year.<p>We&#x27;ve built an iOS app that gathers data on how people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.<p>We&#x27;re well funded, and we&#x27;re looking to bring on a couple more talented engineers. Tech stack involves Rails, iOS&#x2F;Swift, and JS&#x2F;React. Email me at dan@joinroot.com","time":1470065993,"type":"comment"}
