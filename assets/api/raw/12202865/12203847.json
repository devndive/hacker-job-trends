We&#x27;re responsible for the user interface of the GetThere online booking system, which is used by millions of business travelers in over 90 countries. Our team consists of about 10 people, which includes developers, automation engineers, UX designers, and a product owner. We work closely together in short sprints and collaborate with our other teams to deliver our product.<p>The user interface is a server-side application, so we split our coding time on both front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and back-end (Java). Java experience isn&#x27;t strictly necessary if you&#x27;ve worked with a comparable technology and are motivated to learn. We also handle accessibility, web security, internationalization, unit tests, and web automation tests. The system has been around for a while, and we&#x27;re continuously refining and improving it.<p>Let me know if you have any questions, or apply here:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sabre.taleo.net&#x2F;careersection&#x2F;2&#x2F;jobdetail.ftl?job=011HL\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sabre.taleo.net&#x2F;careersection&#x2F;2&#x2F;jobdetail.ftl?job=01...</a>","time":1470069881,"type":"comment"}
