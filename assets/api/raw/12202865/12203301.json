There is no waterfall because there aren&#x27;t really handoffs.<p>-We are extremely data driven, every feature or change is a test, we let the data from tests decide.<p>-We try to do everything as an MVP: since we need data for our decisions we prefer to spend as little time as possible building anything. I know first hand how demoralizing it can be to spend months working on a doomed or pointless project, most of our projects are under 2 weeks, many under one week.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;betterhelp.workable.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;betterhelp.workable.com</a>","time":1470066319,"type":"comment"}
