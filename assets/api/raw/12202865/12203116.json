We want to help the world get smarter every day. The role is roughly 50&#x2F;50 Clojure and Python. All of our new services have been written in Clojure for the past year, we have some Python (particularly our ops and monitoring code) that we aren&#x27;t planning to rewrite anytime soon. Professional Clojure experience IS NOT required (although would be helpful), but a desire to work in Clojure is. We have a myriad of data stores for various purposes, but the vast majority of our data is canonically hosted in PostgreSQL. You would also encounter, at least, Redis, Elasticsearch, ZooKeeper, and MongoDB. We provide full benefits including medical&#x2F;vision&#x2F;dental insurance, paid time off for sickness and vacation, and tax deferred plans for self-funded retirement, transportation, and child care. My name is Brandon and you can contact me via email (brandon@curiosity.com) or on the Clojurians slack (@bja). I&#x27;m on the backend team and can answer any questions and setup an interview with our head of technology.","time":1470065302,"type":"comment"}
