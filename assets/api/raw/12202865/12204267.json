Our customers are the world’s largest financial institutions, law firms, and consultancies. They use our software to identify and address financial crimes such as fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing.<p>We handle hundreds of terabytes of structured and unstructured data, and as a result our infrastructure is pretty complex - Hadoop, HBase, ElasticSearch, Python, Docker, some Go, etc - and highly automated using Ansible.<p>- We&#x27;re looking for devops or systems types to join our small devops team and help us go to the next level in automation and orchestration.\n- Big data engineers with experience using Hadoop&#x2F;HBase&#x2F;ElasticSearch are very interesting, as well as candidates with experience using graph databases.\n- Finally, we’d also like to hear from expert enterprise sales candidates who have sold complex software to complex organizations.<p>Email jobs@arachnys.com with a link to your profiles (github, linkedin etc) if you&#x27;re interested. A founder will read your application and respond within a few days at the latest.<p>Remote applicants who are able to be in one of our offices at least 1 day&#x2F;week may be considered - but you&#x27;d need to be willing to be onsite more at the start.","time":1470072660,"type":"comment"}
