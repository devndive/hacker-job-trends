I’m posting because we’re hiring front end engineers. To give you an idea of what you’d do, you&#x27;ll be working on a algorithmic design tool that helps traditional retailers create more personalized experiences. Likelihood has launched a creative new way for retailers to design and display personalized, brand-rich content directly in their sites, apps, and emails through our “intelligent creative” product.  Our stack is react, node, postgres, and java.<p>It&#x27;s no fun to waste time applying for a job that isn&#x27;t a good fit, so I&#x27;m happy to chat with you on the phone to give you more information.<p>We may have already answered your questions about us on <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.likelihood.com&#x2F;front-end-engineer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.likelihood.com&#x2F;front-end-engineer.html</a>. It covers hiring process, engineering culture, and the project you might work on with us.<p>Interested? Email me and mention you’re from HN.
