You&#x27;ll be coding everything that people use to interact with our hardware, from the Bluetooth interface to the look and feel of the app. Our goal is to make it invisible for people who just want to get stuff done.<p>Other than Objective C, knowledge of other client or server-side languages (say, Javascript and Python) is useful. Experience with Android or embedded C is a bonus, but you&#x27;ll have an opportunity to pick those up.<p>Supermechanical is a small company in Austin designing next-generation consumer hardware (&quot;Internet of Things&quot; is a bad term, but we&#x27;ve been doing it since 2011). We&#x27;re scrappy, low-nonsense, and love manufacturing. This can be a full-time, contract, or paid intern position. Contact work@supermechanical.com with questions, work samples, GitHub repo, resume, and thing you&#x27;re most excited about having learned&#x2F;learning next.","time":1454425892,"type":"comment"}
