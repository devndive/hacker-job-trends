We created an organism that eats sugar and produces Paracetamol (acetaminophen) -- the active ingredient of Tylenol. This is the first biological means of making paracetamol.<p>20n has existing Fortune 500 customers with great incoming revenue. We are also backed by Khosla Ventures, YCombinator, and DARPA. Our core technology is a data mining and machine learning platform for biological data. We routinely distribute using Spark, write approximation algorithms for NP-complete problems, and push the software predictions to robots that build the microbes at lab-in-the-clouds. We are looking for algorithms experts who want to see their predictions create new life!<p>Full job descriptions:<p>* Scientist, Microbial (strain) engineering: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;20n.com&#x2F;jobs.html#team:make\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;20n.com&#x2F;jobs.html#team:make</a><p>* Machine learning: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;20n.com&#x2F;jobs.html#team:predict\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;20n.com&#x2F;jobs.html#team:predict</a><p>* Data mining: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;20n.com&#x2F;jobs.html#team:input\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;20n.com&#x2F;jobs.html#team:input</a><p>* Bioinformatics: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;20n.com&#x2F;jobs.html#team:sequence\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;20n.com&#x2F;jobs.html#team:sequence</a>","time":1454353026,"type":"comment"}
