Our BMI grants the brain a massively parallel channel to digital devices, enabling life-changing therapies for Parkinson&#x27;s and essential tremor, and serving as the data backbone to a new generation of neuroprostheses.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a software engineer to help us develop the software and algorithms underpinning our first product, a groundbreaking instrument for neuroscience research. The instrument is based on a commodity PC, running Linux, and we are looking for help at all levels of the stack, from the GUI that scientists will use to interact with the instrument, and the analytical visualizations that will present meaningful experimental feedback to the user, to the engine that stores, indexes, and manages recorded data to disk.<p>Email us at hn@paradromics.com, we&#x27;ll be happy to hear from you.","time":1454386945,"type":"comment"}
