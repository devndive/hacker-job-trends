On top of that, we are also aggressively evolving Bing search engine from key word search centric system to a set of more general intelligence (AGI) capabilities that can help solve broader intent fulfillment, knowledge retrieval and task completion problems. Apart from the 10 blue links, we also power the instant answer for queries like &quot;why is the sky blue&quot; on bing.com.<p>Our core drivers are large scale machine learning, including DNN based technologies, along with analyzing, inferring and experimenting with truly big data. As part of the team, you would be driving relevance projects through their entire life-cycle from idea creation through implementation, experimentation and finally to shipping. We also closely collaborate with Microsoft Research on joint projects.<p>Preferred qualification: MS&#x2F;PhD in computer science or related field. Background in machine learning, deep learning, NLP, distributed systems, or statistics. Programming experience in C++&#x2F;C#&#x2F;Java.<p>Openings are at all levels.
