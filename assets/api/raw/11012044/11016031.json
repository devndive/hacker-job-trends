Lyst has grown over 300% every year since launch in 2011 and has raised over $60M from top-tier investors<p>At the heart of Lyst is a data aggregator that lists millions of products from hundreds of designers, brands and retail partners. A scraping architecture that makes more than 4 million calls a day, we automatically add, de-duplicate and moderate 1000s of new products to the site every week. On top of this data, we build systems that help people discover, follow and buy from their favourite fashion brands.<p>We&#x27;re most interested in hiring senior engineers to work at all levels of the stack. Lyst is principally a python shop, but really we just want to hire great engineers regardless of language background.
