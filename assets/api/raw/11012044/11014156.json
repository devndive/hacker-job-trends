I need a method that will give me the following information about the currently active window (my app runs in the background):<p><pre><code>   - Application name\n   - Title bar text\n   - Open Document filename (if any)\n   - Active URL if Edge, IE, Chrome, or Firefox browsers\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m primarily a backend developer, but have recently picked up enough C#&#x2F;.NET to be dangerous, I&#x27;m just having trouble fully wrapping my head around the UI Automation framework. I think it&#x27;ll be more effective to have someone with experience do this and let me focus on other pieces.<p>This won&#x27;t be for malware&#x2F;scammy stuff, it&#x27;s user-voluntary to collect some context for a time tracking app similar to RescueTime.<p>I&#x27;m near Charlotte, NC, so someone I can meet in person would be preferred, but remote is perfectly fine. If you&#x27;re actually reading this, include the word &quot;DrPepper&quot; in your email otherwise I&#x27;ll just delete it - I got too much spam last time and very few actual code samples. This particular project is small but there is plenty more available for the right person.<p>Email a link to your github profile or a short C# .NET code sample to jobs at stridatum.com. No recruiters please.","time":1454352257,"type":"comment"}
