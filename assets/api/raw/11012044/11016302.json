Whether it’s the system that sells the adverts in Corrie, pays Ant &amp; Dec, schedules Emmerdale for broadcast or gets TOWIE on to the ITV Hub, it’ll live here and you can help build it.<p>As a Platform Engineer you’ll be embedded in a team responsible for a product end-to-end. Working closely with the developers, testers, product owners and scrum masters you’ll make sure the environments are ticking over nicely, polish the build pipeline and make sure everything’s looking good in production.<p>You’ll be jointly responsible for the quality of everything the team produces - if you build it, you run it. One day you’ll be helping deploy a new microservice, the next watching it handle millions of requests during the X Factor final. The coffee’s not bad, either.<p>Our ethos is simple: automate, automate, automate. We believe in using the right tool for the job - right now we’re using things like AWS, puppet, docker, jenkins, sensu, redis, terraform, centos, rabbitmq, nginx, varnish, haproxy, trello, github and slack - but we’re always keeping an eye on the future and experimenting with new tech. We want our team to be two things: ‘smart’ and ‘kind’. If that’s you and this sounds like fun then I’d like to hear from you - email in my profile.<p>Tom<p>What we offer:<p><pre><code>  * Great salary\n  * Five weeks holiday (plus national holidays)\n  * Annual bonus\n  * Training + conferences\n  * SAYE scheme (discounted shares)\n  * Life cover (4x salary)\n  * Generous pension (matches your contribution + 3%)\n  * ‘Relish’ scheme: gym, extra holiday, cycle to work, childcare vouchers, private healthcare\n  * Volunteer days\n  * Further education sponsorship\n  * Discounts at highstreet + online retailers\n  * Tickets to shows</code></pre>","time":1454367341,"type":"comment"}
