If you know someone who fits, please have them contact jobs@phylagen.com.<p>We are an energized team developing microbiome analysis tools and bioinformatics pipelines for a wide range of environments. We plan to bring on an innovative microbiome scientist - with a minimum of a B.S. in ecology, biology, bioinformatics, engineering, or relevant field (translating to 4-5 years experience). We are looking for someone with extensive experience generating and&#x2F;or analyzing microbiome sample data.  The position will require interdisciplinary skills, including familiarity with wet lab protocols (e.g. DNA extraction, library preparation, and high-throughput sequencing) and knowledge of how to identify individual organisms and characterize communities based on cross-referencing against publicly available reference databases.  Expertise in the analysis of metagenomics data and bioinformatics pipelines is a bonus. We are looking someone who is flexible - a fast learner with relevant experience that will allow them to contribute quickly. You will be a key player in a cutting edge, rapidly growing venture-backed microbiome startup.<p>Phylagen leverages  the vast, unseen world of microbes to improve our daily lives. The microbiome - the trillions of interacting bacteria, fungi, algae, protists, archaea and viruses that inhabit every inch of our world - is the most complex, untapped dataset on earth.  We combine advanced DNA sequencing and bioinformatic analytics with scalable, high performance computing to analyze the microbiome in ways previously not possible. This enables us to determine and interpret complex genetic signatures and provide a powerful new decision-making tool for businesses.","time":1454341325,"type":"comment"}
