We&#x27;re headquartered in Salt Lake City, UT but have offices all over the world and allow remote work from home (a large portion of our company is remotely distributed and working from home, including our Director of Engineering and VP of Product, so we&#x27;re very remote-friendly).<p>We&#x27;re an engineering-driven culture that&#x27;s looking for full-stack engineers, QA, data scientists, mobile devs, and more. Our primary stack is Rails &amp; React, but we&#x27;re not afraid to branch out and give you the independence to try new things. Oh, and the benefits are amazing :)<p>Check out the open positions at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;instructure?lever-via=NiHimSaI8r\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;instructure?lever-via=NiHimSaI8r</a><p>Reach out to me at neil(at)instructure(dot)com with any questions.","time":1454351788,"type":"comment"}
