Our users interact with us 24&#x2F;7 over SMS. We have no user-facing software. Our back-end is a hybrid of human and machine intelligence. We are growing rapidly and our product is in high demand.<p>We are looking for engineers that understand practical business problems and can deploy code to production on a rapid cycle and see measurable impact. Magic’s engineering task is to use software as a weapon to tame a staggering level of real-world complexity. We test our code on live firehose of real data every day.<p>We stay up late coding and we love it. We like to use the latest and greatest technologies but we also know when a quick bash script is the right solution. We are highly iterative. We are relentless. We don’t stop until the job is done.<p>To apply, email jobs@getmagicnow.com.","time":1454381602,"type":"comment"}
