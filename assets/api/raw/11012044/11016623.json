We are in the business of building profitable, self-sustaining business machines. Sometimes that means taking an idea and turning it into a reality, while other times it means acquiring a solid existing business. All of our businesses are currently run with a 3 person engineering team and a lot of shared tools. We&#x27;re looking to expand rapidly as our businesses continue to grow.<p>Check out <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metriccollective.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metriccollective.com&#x2F;</a> for a list of our current businesses:<p>We&#x27;re looking for smart, full-stack engineers who can handle taking on projects independently or work collaboratively on internal tools and cross-business applications.<p>Our stack is mostly Python+App Engine, with a little AWS and other languages&#x2F;tools where needed.
