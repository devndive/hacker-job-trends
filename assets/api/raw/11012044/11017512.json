The company already has a number of Fortune 500 customers and is growing quickly.<p>Permiso automates the process of getting business travel assessments – answering the question whether a traveler requires a business visa, a work permit, or can simply just go (or never go!) Answering this question requires a complex rules engine to take into account country specific rules and travel history.

This is a pain point in many big companies – and is raised as a priority issue when a senior executive has trouble at a border.<p>The stack is F#, AngularJS, and a Redis backend all running on Amazon. We will be replacing AngularJS with React. F# or other MetaLanguage experience is required. React experience is a bonus.<p>This is the lead development role.
