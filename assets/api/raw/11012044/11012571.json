You should be someone who can make things better without being rude, judgmental or arrogant about it. Rockstars need not apply; sessions musicians only.<p>We hired a Rails engineer who gives frequent talks on diversity issues in tech.<p>We hired a stand-up comedian and mathematician who has been blowing out our UIs with React + Flux.<p>We’re migrating our deployment automation from Elastic Beanstalk + Opsworks to Ansible.<p>We do stuff.<p>Unfortunately, we cannot support part-time, remote, or contract work at this time: only an in-house full-time hire here in SF.<p>Email jobs@truelinkfinancial.com and we&#x27;ll get back to you within 2 business days.
