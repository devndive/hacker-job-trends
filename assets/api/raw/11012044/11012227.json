This means building APIs that are easy to understand and easy to use. Over time the platform has evolved to provide richer communications capabilities to a broader array of developers across a much broader set of web and mobile devices. The challenge is therefore to make sure that no matter what kind of applications a developer is trying to build that they have the tools they need to easily debug and thoroughly test their integration before pushing to production.<p>About the job:<p>As a member of the API Tools team you will build software that runs the gamut from command line interfaces to real-time cloud-based logging services to auto-generated testing simulators. This will require real world experience using 3rd party APIs, a diversity of programming experiences and a strong desire to improve the software engineering experience (prototyping, debugging, testing) for Twilio developers.<p>More: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;twilio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;93900\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;twilio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;93900</a><p>Hiring Manager: Carter Rabasa, carter@twilio.com","time":1454340391,"type":"comment"}
