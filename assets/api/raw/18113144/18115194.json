Operating at the intersection of design, computer science, and electro-mechanical engineering, Zoox is a multidisciplinary team working to imagine and build an advanced mobility experience that will support the future needs of urban mobility for both people and the environment. We are presently executing on a plan to deliver a new era of on-demand autonomous electric mobility-as-a-service by 2020. Our mission is to redefine how populations move through our cities.<p>We have raised $500m in our Series B.
