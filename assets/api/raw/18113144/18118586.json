At Flo AI, our mission is to eliminate congestion from cities and give you some of that time back.<p>We’re building an AI platform that leverages transport data to improve the flow of vehicles. We are currently piloting our AI Traffic Control Software (AI-TCS), which manages and optimizes traffic signal timings at city scale to reduce average travel times by up to 20%.<p>We’re currently looking for ML Engineers, Data Engineers and Software Engineers (see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;flo-ai-1&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;flo-ai-1&#x2F;jobs</a>) to further develop our platform. You will be focused on building out our AI-TCS software, building control models, fusing transport datasets and building APIs to traffic controllers.<p>We currently use Hadoop, Cassandra, HBase combined with SUMO, Keras and TensorFlow. We’re looking for engineers who want to shape the future of our platform, putting their own stamp on our stack and build it for scalability.<p>This is a great opportunity to join an ambitious, mission-driven startup taking on a $1tn+ global problem.
