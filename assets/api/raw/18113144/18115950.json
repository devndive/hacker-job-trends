Data driven utilities that are faceless and don’t care about their users. Let’s change that. Let’s make social integrate with real life, with space and time. Let’s make social ephemeral and lets make real connections.<p>Neemo plans to be the first popup social utility on the web. Think of it as a group whataapp chat centered around time and space. Wanna connect with everyone at the Golden State&#x2F;Lakers game? Neemo makes it easy. Its like a flash mob… just there when you’re there for something fun, adding a layer for group chat, photo, video and meme sharing. Make new friends centered around where you are, now.<p>We&#x27;ve got a kickass name, people who helped found one of the fastest and most popular social networks in Asia (Plurk) and a beautiful vision. We just need other self starters who believe and want to help build the next generation of social utilities.<p>Email us with a resume or why you might be a good fit!<p>kan@neemo.com","time":1538422041,"type":"comment"}
