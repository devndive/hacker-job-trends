We&#x27;re Retool (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tryretool.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tryretool.com</a>) - a fast way to build internal tools. We recently launched on HN (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17725966\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17725966</a>). We&#x27;re profitable, growing quickly, and have raised money from great technical founders, including Paul Graham, John + Patrick Collison, Nat Friedman, Greg Brockman, etc.<p>We&#x27;ve significantly de-risked the business (good signals of early pmf, completed 10+ unaffiliated sales via cold email, are profitable, etc.). But there&#x27;s plenty of uncertainty left as well. For example: how do we convert early pmf into actual pmf? How do we scale sales? Should we be doing sales or marketing? Should we be selling to technical or non-technical people?<p>The market for custom enterprise apps is huge. And we think that we have a promising shot at capturing much of it: we have a product that works, that customers love (ping me for a list of customers), and whose usage is growing rapidly.<p>We&#x27;re looking engineers (full-stack) and AEs (ideally with some experience selling SaaS software). You’ll be talking to customers multiple times a day, no matter what the role. Since we’re still early, you’re also welcome to learn about other aspects of the business, like marketing, sales, or whatever else.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, please email me at dh@tryretool.com. Thanks!","time":1538424239,"type":"comment"}
