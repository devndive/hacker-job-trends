Pharmacy in hospitals is kind of like devops in software: the rest of the organization only notices them when something goes wrong, such as a drug not being available when it’s needed.<p>We can’t change the fact that drug shortages happen; the causes range from weather to politics to business. But we can help hospital pharmacy teams be more effective in finding creative ways to get patients the treatments and medications they need.<p>We are currently a team of three: two seasoned hospital pharmacy leaders and a technology leader (that&#x27;s me) with experience building software for hospitals. We’re seeking developers to join our early team and help bring our product development to the next level.<p>Our stack is Python&#x2F;Django, React.js, PostgreSQL-flavored Aurora, and some AWS-specific stuff. If you feel like you want to help solve a real and meaningful problem, and can take on a broad range of coding responsibility, please take a look at our position descriptions, and contact us if there&#x27;s one that looks good to you.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orbitalrx.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orbitalrx.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a>\nengineering-jobs@orbitalrx.com","time":1538421565,"type":"comment"}
