Our revamped application is used by millions, converts 35% better, and halves the completion time.<p>It turns out there’s a lot more to reimagine within government services, which is why we’re partnering with both the Department of Veterans Affairs and Medicare. With the VA, we are working to modernize their appeals system, making millions of veteran’s lives better through the process. Today, the average appeal takes 5 years to process; we can fix this. For Medicare, we are designing and building the architecture for Medicare&#x27;s historic transition towards value-based care.<p>It’s surprising how much can be done by a small group of diverse, empathetic people with deep technical experience, working closely with dedicated civil servants in government. We’ve started Nava as a public benefit corporation to radically improve how our government serves its people, and we believe that the services our government provides should be clear and reliable. If you feel the same way, we&#x27;d love to hear from you.","time":1538684317,"type":"comment"}
