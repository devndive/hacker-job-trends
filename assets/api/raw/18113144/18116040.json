We&#x27;re steadily growing our software team of 11 engineers (including myself), 4 QA engineers, and 1 designer to help develop and release three novel products this year.<p>We&#x27;re relatively young for a biotech company (founded in 2012), but scientists are already really excited about our technology. This is evidenced by the company making $71 million in revenue in 2017, double our revenue the previous year. We&#x27;re working hard to continue the trend this year. Last month we announced that we&#x27;re building out a new office space that&#x27;s quadruple our current square footage. We&#x27;re excited to move into this new space next summer.

We manage our pipelines with Go, develop analysis code using Rust and the NumPy&#x2F;SciPy stack, and drive our front-end applications with React&#x2F;Redux. No previous biological experience is required, but if you&#x27;re interested there are an abundance of opportunities to learn! You&#x27;ll work with a team who are alums of YC, Google, Facebook, 23andMe, MIT, Harvard, Caltech, and more.<p>We&#x27;re currently hiring for all types of software roles including full stack, front end, back end, infrastructure, UI, and QA engineers.
