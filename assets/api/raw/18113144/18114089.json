With simply a sensor that hangs on the wall and sends custom Wi-Fi like signals, and advanced machine learning that analyzes the interactions between the signals and people moving in the environment, Emerald can accurately determine a variety of health metrics - gait, falls, daily activities, and even breathing and heart rate. We have partnerships with several doctors and pharma companies, and have already deployed our systems in over 200 homes.<p>Based on award winning research from Prof. Dina Katabi’s lab (check out her TED talk: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ted.com&#x2F;talks&#x2F;dina_katabi_a_new_way_to_monitor_vital_signs_that_can_see_through_walls?language=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ted.com&#x2F;talks&#x2F;dina_katabi_a_new_way_to_monitor_v...</a>), the technology has garnered significant public interest, including a presentation to President Obama in the White House, a Big Bang Theory Episode, and press coverage on BBC, CNN, and a variety of other outlets. We’re looking for amazing, motivated technical talent to join our small but high-powered team as we take Emerald to the next level.<p>We are searching for Systems Software Engineers and Applied Machine Learning Researchers!
