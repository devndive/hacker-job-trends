Pulumi lets you write infrastructure as code in your favorite language (Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, ...), and supports many clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, ...). We have a complementary SaaS product that helps with continuous deployment and management of your cloud apps and infrastructure.<p>The heart of the system -- the engine and its providers -- is written in Go, but being a multi-language system, we all program in many languages regularly. The SaaS product is a modern Angular app written in TypeScript. Our team is a unique combination of language and cloud geeks, and after just launching out of stealth, we are growing in all areas of the company.<p>More info at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pulumi.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pulumi.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a> or just email jobs@pulumi.com.","time":1538419566,"type":"comment"}
