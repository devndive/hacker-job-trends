Founded by two lead engineers from JP Morgan’s blockchain group, our existing technology stack consists of our open-source smart contract language Pact and our private-chain protocol, ScalableBFT, products that are already in use with Fortune-100 clients, coded entirely in Haskell. We believe Haskell lends a decisive advantage through drastically enhanced productivity, excellent concurrency and parallelization support, unbeatable programming-language tooling, and sheer pleasure of coding. We can’t wait to see what you will add to our stack!<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kadena.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kadena.io&#x2F;</a><p>For more information, email mightybyte@gmail.com","time":1538416091,"type":"comment"}
