A front-end developer with design experience (HTML + CSS, Bootstrap 4) to help us polish the design for the public-facing parts of the site<p>I’ve worked with front-end designer-developers in the past and it’s always been great. The vast majority of the design work for the project has been done by a visual designer and implemented by a front-end developer. Having a single designer-developer instead of both a designer and developer for the final design pass (polish, consistency, and fine tuning) would really speed things along. Design friendly team.<p>Email: Mike at jobs+design(at)edition(dot)io if you&#x27;re interested.<p>2. Angular 6 and&#x2F;or React developer to help us finish our dashboard. Experience with Draft.js and working with Django would be great, but not requirements.<p>Email: Mike at jobs+angular(at)edition(dot)io if you&#x27;re interested.<p>Who we’re looking for someone who’s:<p>* Reliable.<p>* A strong finisher. That last 10% is always a steep climb. (Who’s hyped for progressive image loading?)<p>Who am I:<p>* Hi, I’m Mike. (Python&#x2F;Django developer for 11 years)<p>* Angular + TypeScript for fun in my spare time.
