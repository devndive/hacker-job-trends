Our community of around 200,000 data scientists compete to solve complex data problems. We’re changing the way the most important data-driven problems are solved. We have branched out beyond our core business of machine learning competitions, to build end-to-end solutions in specific industries.\nOur first focus industry is energy, where we are working with Global 10 companies to make better decisions on where and how to drill for oil &amp; gas. Our solutions take detailed geological and engineering data and help predict well performance. These solutions can minimize capital and environmental destruction by helping operators drill fewer uneconomic wells. Kaggle is located in the heart of the SOMA.
