The core of Gametime iOS relies on ReactiveCocoa and functional programming paradigms. We&#x27;ll be switching to Swift as soon as it hits 1.0. We ship a build every Wednesday and move FAST. We peer review everything we write, and hold each other to impeccable standards without letting ourselves get bogged down in perfectionism. At Gametime you&#x27;ll write great code, ship a beautiful product, and play a leading role at one of the fastest growing start ups in the Bay Area.<p><a href=\"https://jobs.lever.co/gametime\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;gametime</a>\nbrad (at) gametime.co","time":1422818588,"type":"comment"}
