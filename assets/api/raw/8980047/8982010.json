Ideally you are a versatile technologist who loves to build web products, especially (but not exclusively) if you have Python experience. Our stack is primarily Python, SqlAlchemy, Backbone and CoffeeScript.<p>Skills are changing too quickly and what makes someone effective in a role or job is evolving. New roles appear daily that no (or few) traditional universities have courses for. People are acquiring more and more skills through non-traditional means. Companies are finding it increasingly difficult to close the &quot;skills gap&quot;.<p>How do you show what you know? How do you even know what you know?<p>Smarterer has created an innovative, machine learning, crowd-sourced testing platform that will disrupt how people think about skills, testing and learning. Donâ€™t let our name fool you, while our system is fun, our unique, patent-pending technology is also deeply rooted in scientific modern testing theory.<p>Smarterer was recently acquired by Pluralsight and continues to operate as an independent entity in Boston. We&#x27;re looking to grow aggressively and have the resources and backing of an amazing organization. Together we&#x27;re building something truly unique, you should be a part of it!<p>Interested?
