We&#x27;re backed by a top VC in London and were featured by Apple as a &#x27;best new app&#x27; in over a hundred countries and are getting some incredible traction. Our team has previously worked for Rocket Internet, Dafiti, Techstars and Pixelmator. We&#x27;ve got strong domain expertise in the area and believe that there&#x27;s a massive opportunity in the space.\nYou&#x27;ll be working on core projects on day 1 and once you&#x27;re familiar with the source, expect to be leading key projects. You&#x27;ll be challenged constantly as we keep pushing the boundaries of what a &#x27;simple&#x27; app can do (algorithms, image analysis etc..).\nWe&#x27;re also quite open about our numbers and our plans, so please drop us a line (hadi@stylectapp.com) and lets chat. Coffee is on us :).<p>P.S: We&#x27;re willing to be flexible for STRONG candidates because our biggest priority is to build an amazing team.","time":1422901591,"type":"comment"}
