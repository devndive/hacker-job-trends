It&#x27;s a reasonably-sized Python&#x2F;Django&#x2F;Javascript app and has been in daily use and continuing improvement for over two years.<p>We created this webapp because available services for dog daycare&#x2F;boarding companies were clunky and limited, as typical for software for niche industries. We&#x27;re confident that whoever takes on this challenge will be able to hit the ground running with a market-leading service.<p>The right person (or pair) should have exceptional technical skills, a combination of product development and customer discovery skills, and the hunger to create and run a thriving niche SaaS business. And a true love for dogs!<p>If interested, get in touch with Ien at ien@alum.mit.edu.","time":1422806021,"type":"comment"}
