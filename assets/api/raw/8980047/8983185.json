With healthy funding (raised $312M, at $2B valuation), growing sales, happy customers and a great culture, this is a great place to tackle hard problems in today&#x27;s enterprise IT. Think Enterprise IT needs to be boring and ugly? Time to think again. At Nutanix, user experience and design is seen as a competitive advantage.<p>Feel free to drop me an e-mail (my username [at] nutanix.com) with your resume, cover letter (if you have one) and the exact job you&#x27;re applying for, and I&#x27;ll be sure to drop it in the right queue.","time":1422864377,"type":"comment"}
