EdTech.<p>Course Hero is looking for a software engineer (web or iOS) who can hit the ground running.<p>Our team releases code every day to millions of people, so we&#x27;re looking for someone who can take on challenges, build new features, and iterate quickly. Each engineer has a role in building Course Hero&#x27;s architecture and will have the opportunity to touch all parts of the stack. Our projects are big -- terabytes of data and customers around the world -- but our team is small, so you’ll see projects from start to finish, working closely with product managers and designers to ensure successful results.<p>Our company culture is very open, flat, and transparent. We succeed and learn together. Our office is very comfortable, has a lot of natural light, and great amenities like a gym and walking trails onsite. We’ve tried hard to make this a pleasant and inspiring place to do creative work.<p>Most importantly, we seek to hire individuals whose personality, integrity and passion for our business make our team better as a whole. We’re growing fast, profitable (yes, it’s true!), and looking for another core team member to push us toward the future.<p>For mobile, we’re focused on iOS for now. Our web stack is LAMP (PHP) + jQuery and AngularJS, but we’re open to people with all kinds of experience.<p><a href=\"https://www.coursehero.com/jobs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursehero.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a><p>Please email: jobs@coursehero.com (and put “Hacker News” in the subject)","time":1422856702,"type":"comment"}
