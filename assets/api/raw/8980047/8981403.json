As of January 2015, Chariot offers three commuter routes in San Francisco: Chestnut Bullet, SoMa Express, and Cole Valley Cruiser. Our riders often use federally-mandated commuter transit benefits for savings of up to 40% - a feature taxis will never be able to offer.<p>The commute is an enormous pain point for workers around the world; it can either make or break someone&#x27;s day, and we&#x27;re solving it, one neighborhood at a time. The team at Chariot tirelessly works to improve the existing customer experience on our mature routes and pushes to launch new routes as fast as possible.<p>We&#x27;re hiring a lead mobile developer, a backend engineer, and marketing roles at all levels. Stack includes Python, Angular.js, Swift (iOS), and PostgreSQL.<p><a href=\"https://angel.co/chariot/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;chariot&#x2F;jobs</a><p>Even if you&#x27;re just curious, reach out to ali@chariotsf.com!","time":1422820782,"type":"comment"}
