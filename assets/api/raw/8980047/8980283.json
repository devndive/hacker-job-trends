Our first sensor network is for wireless signal [1] where we are building a global database on the coverage and performance of wireless networks (both mobile + WiFi) on a scale that has never before been possible. Our second sensor network is WeatherSignal [2], which uses the barometers, thermometers and hygrometers on smart phones to crowdsource weather data and we have already published a scientific paper [3] showing the potential of this approach. If the concept of crowdsourced sensor networks appeals to you too then please get in touch. We are hiring for all manner of different roles right now (DevOps, backend, frontend, UX&#x2F;UI &amp; data science) but most of all we are just looking for smart, like minded people rather than people with specific, existing skills. We also recently raised our $4million series A [4] from Qualcomm Ventures, O&#x27;Reilly Alphatech Ventures &amp; Passion Capital so are growing fast.  We also like data visualization a lot [5].<p>More info: <a href=\"http://opensignal.com/jobs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensignal.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a><p>Email us: join@opensignal.com<p>[1] OpenSignal App: <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.staircase3.opensignal\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.staircase3...</a><p>[2] WeatherSignal App: <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opensignal.weathersignal\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.opensignal...</a><p>[3] Battery Temperature&#x2F;Weather correlation: <a href=\"http://opensignal.com/reports/battery-temperature-weather/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensignal.com&#x2F;reports&#x2F;battery-temperature-weather&#x2F;</a><p>[4] OpenSignal Series A: <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/05/opensignal-series-a/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;05&#x2F;opensignal-series-a&#x2F;</a><p>[5] OpenSignal Reports: <a href=\"http://opensignal.com/reports/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensignal.com&#x2F;reports&#x2F;</a>","time":1422805994,"type":"comment"}
