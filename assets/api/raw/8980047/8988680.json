Our traction has been astounding. We launched in 2014, and already have hundreds of paying districts, with our software installed on over 800,000 school-owned devices. We are now processing 30 million events per day and growing about 10% week over week.<p>Engineering-wise, we need full-stack help. We&#x27;re in the process of rebuilding our entire event ingestion pipeline (going from PHP+MySQL to Kinesis+Java+Cassandra+Solr). We&#x27;ve got a team of seven engineers (including myself). We&#x27;re all responsible for everything (frontend, backend, database, deployments, everything). We&#x27;re looking for someone who wants to make tremendous impact in the organization - making key engineering decision that will impact the company for years to come. We&#x27;re looking for killer frontend and backend people as well as data scientists (we&#x27;ve got a goldmine of usage data that we haven&#x27;t run any non-trivial analytics on).<p>We&#x27;re Pre-Series-A and profitable! We&#x27;re in the process of raising an A round which will enable us to scale up. If you&#x27;re interested in an early stage startup that&#x27;s positioned well for stable growth, please reach out!<p>Hit us up at jobs@goguardian.com","time":1422933545,"type":"comment"}
