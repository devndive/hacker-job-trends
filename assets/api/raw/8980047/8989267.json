We added 2 million job seekers, 50,000 employers, grew to 60 employees and launched two amazing products. We’re well-funded and have healthy cash flow.<p>In the next year, we must go from handling 20,000 missed calls a day now to 200,000; from 1m desktop and mobile visitors a month to 20 million, from a Dev team of 9 to 50 and an operations and sales team of 25 to 250.<p>We’re looking for someone who has lived through this kind of growth and company transformation at another startup, because we haven’t and could use some steady hands. We’re looking for someone with the charisma to attract and inspire a stellar collection of developers, designers and PMs.<p>Most importantly, we’re looking for someone passionate about not only scaling something huge, but scaling something that changes the world for the better.<p>If this sounds beyond interesting to you, email our CEO Sean Blagsvedt at {first_name}@babajob.com.","time":1422947693,"type":"comment"}
