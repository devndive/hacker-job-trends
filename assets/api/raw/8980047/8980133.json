We&#x27;re helping companies recruit by providing simple, impartial assessment of programming skills at an initial stage of the process. Currently this means basic algorithmics (e.g. &quot;write a function that does this and this, and figure out how to do it in linear time&quot;), but we&#x27;re also experimenting with other types of programming tasks.<p>We&#x27;re still a small company (less than 30 people) with lots of ideas on what to build next. I&#x27;ve been here for two years now as a programmer, and I really enjoyed seeing how far we have come and how much we have been able to learn.<p>Our development team has seven software engineers and two sysadmins. We have a continuous integration cycle, code reviews and some pair programming. The technology stack includes Python, Django, Postgres, Celery and Chef.<p>See the full job ad for more details: <a href=\"https://codility.com/jobs/?gh_jid=32596#job\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codility.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;?gh_jid=32596#job</a>.
