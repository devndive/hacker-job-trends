I&#x27;m building out a new engineering team at an established startup in Ed-Tech.  First, a little bit of who we are:<p>TpT is the world&#x27;s first and biggest online open marketplace where teachers buy, sell, and share original educational materials. Our community of over 4 million teachers connects and shares knowledge on the site every day, and has generated almost $150 million in sales of some of the best, original, most creative classroom resources.<p>Now, for you.  Do you love what Github has done for software?  Can you imagine having to write a web server from scratch every time you build a website? Do you love being a developer that&#x27;s standing on the shoulders of giants?  That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing for teachers at TpT - creating a culture and marketplace to empower teachers.  Every teacher out there knows what it&#x27;s like to work a full day in the classroom and then work all night putting together lesson plans for the next day.  TpT is where they can find other teachers who&#x27;ve dealt with the same problem and are putting up their crafted resources for sale.<p>I&#x27;m putting together a &#x27;dream team&#x27; so to speak of engineers who will be the core of our NYC team.  The site is currently PHP with NGINX and MySQL on either end.  However, we&#x27;re playing with Ruby quite a bit and tend to be polyglots.<p>* Software Engineer - <a href=\"http://grnh.se/l56nvo\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;l56nvo</a>","time":1422921462,"type":"comment"}
