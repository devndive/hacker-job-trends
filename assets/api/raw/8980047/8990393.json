That’s not an overstatement, it’s the truth. Learning a new language is the single hardest things that you can ask an adult to do. We make it happen for 2.5 million people. Every. Single. Day.<p> Voxy provides a cloud-based English language learning platform that’s based on 20 years of cutting edge scientific research into language learning. It’s proven effective, in the lab and in the wild. It’s a tough problem, but that’s okay, we like tough problems and you should too.<p>We’re looking for engineers who want to join a growing start-up as we tackle the old-school entrenched players in a $80B&#x2F;year industry that hasn’t seen any real innovation in decades. We’ve got a kick-ass culture, paying customers, top-tier investors, and we can make it happen.<p>Things that are important to us:<p>- Engineers. Real engineers. That means you problem solve first and write code second. \n - We’re about the right tool for the job. At the moment that’s Python, Backbone, MongoDB and Progress. In the future, maybe something else.  \n - We build our mobile solutions as native apps.\n  - We pair-program and follow Agile. Unless it’s not working, in which case we don’t. \n - Thirst for learning. What we’re working on today may be something different tomorrow, and as a company we support that. \n - Respect. We love new ideas and discussion, and while we don’t always agree with each other our strong opinions are loosely held.   <p>Competitive salary, stock, medical, dental, vision, etc. Yep, we’ve got that, plus a whole host of other benefits like CitiBike memberships, gym reimbursements, snacks, beer (to offset the gym memberships), unlimited vacation, free Mandarin&#x2F;Spanish&#x2F;French lessons, and a bunch of other stuff. HQed in NoHo, with offices in Chelsea and São Paolo, we are situated amidst multiple train lines, restaurants, coffee shops, bike stores, bars, gyms, fashion, galleries and general NY excellence.<p>If you’ve got the chops and you’re a real engineer, even if you don’t currently use our stack, let’s talk.<p>Apply here: <a href=\"http://grnh.se/on0gyj\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;on0gyj</a>","time":1422973173,"type":"comment"}
