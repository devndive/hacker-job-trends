Details:<p>- Commission-only role!  Pay is a generous, recurring 33% commission on the LIFETIME revenue for each account you generate.<p>- Both part-time and full-time are acceptable. This is a super flexible, at-your-own-pace position.<p>- A sales or account executive background is helpful, but not necessarily a requirement -- we&#x27;ll consider anyone with relevant history and personality&#x2F;passion alignment.<p>- Experience&#x2F;familiarity with the nonprofit and&#x2F;or church industry is a plus. Even more bonus points for bringing an existing network of prospects.<p>- Located anywhere in the world. The more geographically diverse our team can be, the better.  Donation Spring supports most major currencies and we&#x27;re certainly not limited to the US.<p>- Must have a fun, easy going, and service-centered heart. Our primary focus is serving both nonprofit&#x2F;church missions as well as helping their staff in tech-centric ways.<p>If that describes you, we&#x27;d love to chat!  brett@donationspring.com","time":1509554462,"type":"comment"}
