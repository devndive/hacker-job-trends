Here is a little more about us:<p>At AdvicePay, we are helping shape the future of financial planning because we believe there is a more straight-forward way for consumers to get financial advice. AdvicePay is the missing piece of the puzzle to bring real financial planning to Americans. Historically financial planning advice was only available to millionaires, however advisors have shifted focus to helping people build wealth, instead of only those who have wealth. Those advisors have bet with complicated compliance regulations have have hindered the ability for advisors to work with these clients. AdvicePay is the first and only way for financial planners to get paid in a compliant way on a monthly or one-time basis by ACH or credit cards. We’re looking for a Chief Technology Officer to help lead our team.<p>We are a small team, and we we work independently or together. You’ll have an opportunity for autonomy, but there’s also opportunity to work with other team members, share ideas, and grow together.<p>Feel free to email me (joe [at] advicepay [dot] com) if you have any questions on the role or apply directly and our CEO will review your application. I am an engineer on the project.","time":1509549742,"type":"comment"}
