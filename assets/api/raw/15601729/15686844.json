Currently we have well over 2.000.000 users. We’ve quickly grown in The Netherlands over the past few years and the time has come to spread our wings and take the rest of the world by storm. We aim to play a big part in the liberalization of the worldwide education system. With rising tuition fees and income inequality, we feel there is a need for an online education platform where students all over the world share their knowledge for free.<p>We are looking for a talented addition to our team who is a wizard with JavaScript and has ample experience with modern JS frameworks. You will be working with our designers and back end developers to create responsive pages which provide our users with the best possible experience. Your hunger for technology is only matched by your motivation to solve difficult problems fast, efficient and with a keen eye for design. Our team is still small which will put you right at the core of our developer team. Joining us now gives you the opportunity to be one of our team leaders in the future.<p>In our Amsterdam office you will find the informal atmosphere you would expect from a start-up company. We’re based in a nice and bright office in the heart of Amsterdam with a large garden, right besides the canals. Every day we all have lunch together and once a week we’ll crack open a few beers, bring out our table- tennis and football! And let&#x27;s not forget about the occasional pubquizzes, board game nights and bbq cook-offs!","time":1510584691,"type":"comment"}
