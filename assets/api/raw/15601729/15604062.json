One founder previously sold a company and is a published machine learning researcher; the other was Chief of Staff at Dropbox, and many on our team are from other great organizations (Google, MIT, McKinsey)<p>We have some really interesting machine learning, infrastructure, and interface projects to work on: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1gxoVieC6toGChvjP8YmRXU4hl7PGLXi1DvAa8530wyo&#x2F;edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1gxoVieC6toGChvjP8YmRXU4h...</a><p>Our stack: Python (Django, nltk), AWS (S3, PostgreSQL), Javascript (React)<p>We care deeply about personal growth, doing the right thing, and making a positive impact on the world.<p>Email: josh@sourceress.co","time":1509560669,"type":"comment"}
