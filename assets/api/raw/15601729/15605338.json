We&#x27;re building an amazing team, users rave about our product, and things are taking off â€“ we&#x27;re closing seven-figure contracts and revenue grew 5x last year. And we&#x27;re doing it on a sane, 40-hour, daily-team-hike, Fridays-at-home schedule. We&#x27;re pre-series-A, but in many ways playing like a series B company, so this is a chance to get the best of both worlds -- early-stage equity and impact, with later-stage compensation and stability; plus a very strong team for peering or mentorship.<p>Backend Engineer: We&#x27;ve built a NoSQL data engine from scratch that searches text at 750 GB&#x2F;second.
