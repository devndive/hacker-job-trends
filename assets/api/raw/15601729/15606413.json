We&#x27;ve been prototyping a project for two years and we want to be in production within 2 months.<p>Engineers here are pointed at really interesting problems and given the space to work on them. I&#x27;ve honestly never worked at a company that&#x27;s better struck that balance between not micromanaging, but also not just giving you vague requirements hoping you&#x27;ll create value.<p>- Highly technical, easy to work with director\n- All the typical bells and whistles (infinite real coffee, weekly shopping list, parties etc)\n- Strict &quot;No dickhead&quot; policy<p>Please email ddrew@creditsense.com.au if that sounds attractive to you :)","time":1509578546,"type":"comment"}
