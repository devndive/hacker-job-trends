We&#x27;re looking for someone to join our team of 6 developers and help build software that makes a difference to the environment and to the lives of city dwellers.<p>We have several single page app products (EmberJS, Rails, Django and PostgreSQL), and weâ€™re exploring more advanced mathematical modelling and algorithms in our new products. This role will be focussed on contributing to our products across all layers of the stack.<p>You&#x27;ll be able to work all the way from product design to architecture and code, and as the team is relatively small, you will be making a significant contribution. Our development team is agile and co-located, with daily stand-ups, a kanban wall, retrospectives and pairing as appropriate.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, please email me directly at vivek.prahlad@kinesis.org","time":1509662910,"type":"comment"}
