With 30% monthly growth, we now operate in 80+ cities across 12+ countries and host over 12million+ users. With our recent Series D funding success, we are positioned on the cusp of significant scale and well on target to deliver our goal of creating one million jobs in the region by 2018.<p>Careem Labs, a new division within Careem, can best be described as a startup within a startup. Our goal is to build a platform that will enable others within the region to leverage the capabilities that Careem has built. This includes our core services such as ride hailing, payments, location services and more. We&#x27;re starting from the ground up, firstly by enabling our clients to become partners and then giving them access to our core services. We&#x27;re a small team made up of engineers (front and backend) as well as product managers. We&#x27;re at an early stage so there is plenty of room to make a huge impact within the team and the whole region.<p>Our tech stack currently includes Java 8, Javascript, iOS and Android, Docker and a mix of SQL and NoSQL databases. We have a microservice based architecture and knowledge of distributed systems is highly valued. We deploy onto AWS. Our tech stack is not completely defined yet and will expand to include more technologies. We&#x27;re interested in all kinds of technical backgrounds.<p>I&#x27;m one of the engineers on the team.
