The SEI is currently looking at improving software analysis and code repair technologies to eliminate security vulnerabilities much faster and at a much lower cost than current manual repair capabilities.  We are improving the technologies by developing new techniques for analyzing and transforming code, in source code and intermediate representations.<p>The successful candidate will both work on advanced research projects and work directly with customers to help transition our research into practice.  Candidates will be subject to a background check and must be eligible to obtain and maintain a Department of Defense security clearance.<p>Apply online at: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appone.com&#x2F;MainInfoReq.asp?R_ID=1598504&amp;B_ID=44&amp;InternalJobCode=126116&amp;fid=1&amp;Adid=0&amp;CountryID=3&amp;LanguageID=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appone.com&#x2F;MainInfoReq.asp?R_ID=1598504&amp;B_ID=44&amp;...</a>","time":1509568684,"type":"comment"}
