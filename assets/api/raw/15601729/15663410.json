Your work will directly impact our customers in the form of products and services that make use of speech and language technology.\nThe Alexa Science and Machine Learning team made the magic of Alexa possible, but that was just the beginning. Our goal is to make voice interfaces ubiquitous and as natural as speaking to a human. We have a relentless focus on the customer experience and customer feedback. We use many real-world data sources including customer interactions and a variety of techniques like highly scalable deep learning. Learning at this massive scale requires new research and development.<p>Experience in Perl, Python, or another scripting language; command line usage\n路 Track record of diving into data to discover hidden patterns and of conducting error&#x2F;deviation analysis\n路 High-level knowledge of various machine learning techniques and key parameters that affect their performance\n路 Ability to develop experimental and analytic plans for data modeling processes, use of strong baselines, ability to accurately determine cause and effect relations\n路 Understanding of relevant statistical measures such as confidence intervals, significance of error measurements, development and evaluation data sets, etc.<p>Alexa Science is a small team in Cambridge, MA (next to MIT) please reach out if you would like to learn more!
