We’ve cut out the middleman and eradicated the warehouse, to guarantee delivery of the freshest, high quality food at the best prices.<p>We’re looking for a backend engineer to join us in furthering our mission and help build out the technology platform which will be integral to the long term success of Foodchain.<p>Foodchain is an early stage startup with a small engineering team. This is an opportunity to play a key role in shaping the vision for the platform and share significant responsibility in the team.<p>We need someone with hands on experience building backend systems and APIs, preferably in SOA or microservice architectures. Hopefully you’ll have experience in dynamic languages like Python or Javascript but also some strongly typed experience with Go, Java or Scala.<p>Here’s some of the things we’d like you to work on:<p>- Own the overall architecture of the event based microservices platform<p>- Develop the API endpoints for the mobile and frontend apps<p>- Develop integrations with third party providers e.g logistics and accounting<p>- Work with the rest of the product team to estimate and plan future features<p>We&#x27;re based in London but open to remote work.<p>Send your CV&#x2F;LinkedIn&#x2F;GitHub profile to jobs@joinfoodchain.com if interested","time":1509627951,"type":"comment"}
