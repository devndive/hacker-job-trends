By innovating at every step, Planet has created an inexpensive way to image the entire Earth every day, and deliver fast, actionable insights to customers, researchers, governments and NGOs.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a smart, curious human to work on Tile Services, the mechanism by which we deliver Planet Imagery to the web and desktop applications which helps visualize these insights.  If you&#x27;re not sure what a tile service does, you can see it in action in Planet Explorer (www.planet.com&#x2F;explorer). Take a minute to zoom around and explore. Pretty neat, right? There&#x27;s a lot of server-sided tooling behind the scenes to make these maps fast and responsive. That&#x27;s where you come in.<p>Our tech stack is Golang, Python, Kubernetes, and a mix of AWS and Google Cloud. Come build with us!<p>Learn more at: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;planetlabs&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;884628#.WeZNCBNSwWo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;planetlabs&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;884628#.WeZNCBN...</a>","time":1509570251,"type":"comment"}
