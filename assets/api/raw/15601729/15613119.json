Unfortunately, Lambda has a hard cap of 50MB (compressed) and Impala&#x27;s build footprint is somewhat larger.\nSo, he is hiring for a consulting&#x2F;contract gig, and the task for the consultant would be to trim unnecessary functionality (e.g. in Boost) in order to reduce the size of the build.\nGoal&#x2F;timeline is shipping a sufficiently small build by end of year.<p>Please ping me if you&#x27;re available and I will make the intro.<p>Flexible on payment terms...hourly while we firm up scope, and then fixed price and&#x2F;or daily&#x2F;weekly consulting rate.","time":1509648342,"type":"comment"}
