We try to bring together its expertise and extensive database with the mindset of a software company to develop new products in a digital world. We think there is currently a massive untapped opportunity to seize, in a vast but complex and strongly regulated market, and we believe we are uniquely positioned to capture it.<p>Our main product at the moment is a REST(-ish) API, allowing other platforms to include our insurance product. Think travel insurance tickbox, but for the risk of not getting your invoice paid on time. It is developed in C#&#x2F;.NET and hosted on Azure. We also have some systems on AWS, and upcoming products, tools or test suites developed in Python and JavaScript.<p>We already have multiple customers in production and are scaling up. The team working on these products is still quite small (around 10 people), so your exact role will depend more on your abilities than a rigid description. Overall, we need software, QA and devops engineers.<p>We try our best to maintain a fantastic team in a diverse, welcoming and relaxed work environment. We offer competitive salaries, depending on profile, education, experience.<p>If you are interested, please reach out to sami (at) ehda.co (CTO) with your resume.","time":1509562839,"type":"comment"}
