We have had great success proving out our process and tech and are now looking to grow the software team to help us scale and have a global impact.<p>We use our software to ingest data from hundreds of sensors we deploy in buildings, analyze that data to understand how the building is operating and using energy, and create thermodynamic models to quantify the energy use and savings we can achieve. After we implement the projects we use our platform again to provide ongoing monitoring of a building to ensure we are getting the energy savings we guarantee over the next 10 years.<p>About the position and to apply:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carbonlighthouse.com&#x2F;seniorsoftwaredeveloper&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carbonlighthouse.com&#x2F;seniorsoftwaredeveloper&#x2F;</a>\nWe are looking to hire two senior software developers to not only write code, but help us brainstorm and architect our analytics and modeling software platform.
