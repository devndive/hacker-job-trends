Using a combination of 3D graphics and computer vision, we allow you to &quot;try on&quot; furniture before you buy it. We&#x27;re looking for platform engineers of all levels and particularly people with experience in ETL pipelines, search indexing + optimization, payments&#x2F;e-commerce, and distributed systems. We&#x27;ve hit &quot;hockey stick&quot; growth and you&#x27;d be helping to scale a product that is used by thousands daily.<p>You&#x27;d be joining an incredibly talented team of engineers, artists, designers and creators that bring the Modsy magic every day. We&#x27;re first movers in an exciting space that will soon become the future of home design. Check out modsy.com&#x2F;portfolio and see if you can tell which of our images on our site are real vs. renderings (hint: they are all renderings). Our stack is React&#x2F;Redux&#x2F;WebGL + Django&#x2F;Python.<p>We&#x27;re also always interested in speaking with people who have a background in Computer Vision &#x2F; 3D Graphics &#x2F; Machine Learning so please feel free to reach out.<p>We do a phone&#x2F;in-person interview with the Head of Engineering, phone call with one of our engineers, and then one day in office to meet the team.<p>Drop me a line at juan@modsy.com if you&#x27;re interested to learn more!","time":1509592235,"type":"comment"}
