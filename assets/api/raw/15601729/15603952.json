Our mission is to use the power of technology to create stronger and safer neighborhoods all around the world. Over 75% of the neighborhoods in the US are using our platform to communicate about the issues most important to them, and we&#x27;ve just started expanding internationally as well in the Netherlands, UK, and Germany. Founded in 2010, we&#x27;re backed by Benchmark Capital, Greylock Partners, Google Ventures, and Tiger Global among others, and have raised over $210M in venture capital to-date.<p>We are hiring across the board, and growing quickly. A list of our open job reqs can be found here at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nextdoor.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nextdoor.com&#x2F;jobs</a>. In particular, we&#x27;re always looking for great full-stack generalists who are comfortable working in an agile, fast-paced environment. Our stack is primarily Python and Go, running on AWS, with client apps built in Obj-C&#x2F;Swift (iOS), Java (Android), and React JS (Web).<p>Our office is in San Francisco (mid-Market) close to Civic Center BART. If you&#x27;re looking for a relatively small startup (we&#x27;re still fewer than 200 people total, with ~70 in engineering) with an opportunity to have global impact, we&#x27;d love to hear from you at jobs@nextdoor.com.","time":1509560021,"type":"comment"}
