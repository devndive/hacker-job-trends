We are a very early stage startup that just launched back in June. We recently received funding from the Japanese government and are looking to convert our very basic site into a more polished service with mobile apps as well. We are also looking for marketing and business people as the sole founder is more on the technical side.<p>We&#x27;re based in Tokyo but happy to consider remote people. All jobs start as contracts as we are very early stage and can&#x27;t offer much in the way of benefits.<p>Email here if interested or you have questions: therenegadeoffunk (@) gmail.com<p>* Main Site: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yakukon.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yakukon.com</a>\n* Jobs Page: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yakukon.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;careers-investors&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yakukon.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;careers-investors&#x2F;</a>\n* Blog: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@keiyakukekkon\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@keiyakukekkon</a>\n* Essay on Marriage: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;psiloveyou.xyz&#x2F;the-importance-of-marriage-66abf1a57218\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;psiloveyou.xyz&#x2F;the-importance-of-marriage-66abf1a572...</a>","time":1509599672,"type":"comment"}
