We run our own stack and provide customization services (code is free, time isn&#x27;t). We can tinker, need to think out-of-the-box&#x2F;ram&#x2F;space and work mostly autonomous. We all use Chromebooks, our hierarchy is as flat as the area around Lille, our offices are paperless and we have no meetings. We mostly hack in Python and (vanilla) JavaScript. If you&#x27;re looking for fame or gain, we&#x27;re not the right place. For purpose and leverage, we might be worth considering. Join us!","time":1509554808,"type":"comment"}
