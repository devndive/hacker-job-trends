We build intelligence products for patent attorneys and applicants.<p>We are currently looking for an experienced front-end developer with familiarity around modern front-end JS frameworks (Angular, React, ...), and an experienced full-stack JS developer comfortable with ES6&#x2F;7, Node.js, Express, and so on.<p>Our engineering team is currently 5 developers, of which 4 are onsite in Saint Louis. We have a very laid back, autonomous work culture, and we provide lots of flexibility and support in terms of using the best tech and tools for the task at hand. We are on AWS and use JS almost entirely, but we never exclude other languages or tech if it&#x27;s right for the job.<p>As for our interview process, it generally starts with looking at your code, then a video chat &quot;phone screen&quot; (if not in Saint Louis), and then an on-site interview to meet the team, see the office, and get to know you better. We&#x27;ll make the final decision after all candidates have finished that process.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, check out our careers page at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.juristat.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.juristat.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a> or send resume, cover letter, code samples &#x2F; Github, etc to jobs@juristat.com","time":1485971991,"type":"comment"}
