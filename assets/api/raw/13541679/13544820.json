Come move atoms with bits.<p>We&#x27;ve raised our Series B, and just got named one of the top 10 startups to watch in NYC by Inc: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inc.com&#x2F;zoe-henry&#x2F;10-new-york-startups-to-watch-in-2017.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inc.com&#x2F;zoe-henry&#x2F;10-new-york-startups-to-watch-i...</a><p>- Our stack is currently React&#x2F;Redux and Aurelia on the front-end, and Rails&#x2F;Node&#x2F;Lambda on Docker for the backend. But we have lots of green-field projects ahead to try new stuff.\n- We&#x27;re well-funded with founders who deeply understand the domain we&#x27;re serving (the freight logistics industry), and several were early employees at Gilt Groupe.\n- We&#x27;re all about constant learning as an engineering team through code reviews, experimenting with new tools, and internal tech talks and doing meetups in NYC.<p>Our interview consistent of a short technical video chat (with a Transfix engineer) interview followed by half-day on-site where you&#x27;ll meet various team members (including the co-founders) and go through a more coding problems.\nI&#x27;m a front-end engineer at Transfix and  think it&#x27;s an amazing place to solve complicated, real-world problems.
