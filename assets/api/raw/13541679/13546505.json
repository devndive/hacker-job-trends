It’s a challenging role, working on hard problems, and offers the chance to work with a top technical team and shape a company and product from an early stage.<p>NStack is funded by top-tier investors from the West Coast, the founders are both technical and ex-YC &#x2F; academia, and our team is lucky enough to include world-class talent for the problem we&#x27;re solving.
