Think Google Assistant or Alexa or Siri, but without having to carefully craft commands like you&#x27;re talking to a Bash shell.<p>Our team has built much of the core technology underlying Siri and Google Now, and our founders (including both the former Chief Speech Scientist for Siri and the head of UC Berkeley&#x27;s Natural Language Processing group) have multiple &gt;$100 million exits under their belt.<p>We&#x27;re looking to hire a few talented software engineers and machine learning engineers to help build out technology, by expanding our core NLP infrastructure, data processing pipelines, neural net clusters, and backend services.<p>Experience with natural language processing systems is a plus, as is experience with the JVM (especially Scala), but we&#x27;re mainly interested in passionate engineers who can learn quickly and work effectively in complex systems.<p>Please reach out to me directly or email info@semanticmachines.com.
