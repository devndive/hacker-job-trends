Our goal is to spread the DMARC standard and ensure no one gets their personal data stolen ever again. We like opinionated engineers who enjoy a healthy debate but can commit to a solution. We&#x27;re AWS hosted and are working hard to automate away as many of the reactive and tedious aspects of development as possible. We&#x27;ve got a nice Scrum approach that empowers engineers to make their own decisions and look to improve with each sprint. Our stack includes Ember, RoR, Python and Spark as well as orchestration and automation via Packer, Consul, Terraform and Ansible.\nchaag)at(agari[dot|com","time":1485974094,"type":"comment"}
