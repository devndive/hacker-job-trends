We create everything from kids movie websites to games, apps and connected toys. Our regular clients include Disney, Hasbro, Warner Bros., PBS Kids, Scholastic, Dreamworks and a host of other kid focused companies. <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.curiousmedia.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.curiousmedia.com</a>\n <p>We’ve been around since 2004 and have a team of 35. We are extremely stable and have many employees who have been with the company for 6-12 years now. We are very mindful and focused on being a family friendly workplace, both in the type of jobs we take and our expectations of employees time. We rarely work more than 40 hours a week and when we do, we give PTO at a 1:1 ratio (any hours over 45 in a week).<p>We are more specifically located in Nampa, about 14 miles west of Boise. Many employees commute from Boise&#x2F;Meridian and its rarely more than a 25 minute commute as all the traffic is going towards Boise (and the opposite on the way home). This area is amazingly affordable and provides easy access to a wealth of outdoor activities. The closest respectable ski mountain is only about 30 minutes from downtown Boise and there are some world class resorts within 2-3 hours (Sun Valley, Tamarack, Brundage). If you are from one of the larger cities and looking for a change of pace, you should check Boise out!<p>More details here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.curiousmedia.com&#x2F;assets&#x2F;content&#x2F;curious-media-web-developer.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.curiousmedia.com&#x2F;assets&#x2F;content&#x2F;curious-media-web...</a><p>Apply: jobs@curiousmedia.com","time":1485965236,"type":"comment"}
