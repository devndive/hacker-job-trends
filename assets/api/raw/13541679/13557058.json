Bonus points for:<p>• The ability to code in a variety of languages, particularly of the functional flavour<p>• Data science skills (R&#x2F; Pandas etc, solid stats background)<p>• Devops, containers, Kubernetes, aws<p>• Familiarity with any parts of our stack<p>We are also hiring UX designers to revamp the UX of our rather complex product.<p>For engineers, our interview process consists of a short code test (if you don&#x27;t have any publicly accessible code for us to look at), and a technical interview in our Collins St office, 1-2 hours. After that, we&#x27;ll be in touch within about a week.<p>For UX designers, if we&#x27;re happy with your portfolio, we&#x27;ll give you some paid work to see if we&#x27;re a mutual fit.<p>Email me (joash at getswift dot co), prefixing the subject with &quot;HN:&quot;.
