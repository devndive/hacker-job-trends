Our mission is to find a safe, loving, and stable family for every child.<p>Binti&#x27;s software is used by private adoption agencies in 30 states. We&#x27;re in the midst of expanding into serving government foster care agencies and are close to reaching two-thirds of the foster care families in the state of California.<p>We have sustainable revenue, fanatical customers, and ample seed funding from top investors like First Round, Kapor, and Lowercase. We work together in SF and are growing rapidly.<p>Binti&#x27;s main SaaS web product is a conventional monolithic Rails&#x2F;Postgres app that delivers value in heaps and heaps, and remains super fun to hack on. We&#x27;re building the monolith up higher and higher, and looking forward to soon chipping off a service or two (perhaps in Elixir?). Some of the areas in which we are especially seeking to round out our engineering team include devops, security, and compliance (we&#x27;re seeking a full-stack engineer interested in contributing in these areas early on - whether or not you are already an expert).
