The automotive industry traditionally has relied on face to face sales which is stressful and actually not that great for the consumer. We’re using technology and a fresh approach to change the way that the industry approaches the customer. In much the same way that Deliveroo has transformed the way that people order from restaurants, we’re looking to disrupt this marketplace. We’ve raised over £19m in funding, from Europe’s best VCs, and facilitated the purchase of more than £1 billion worth of cars.<p>We currently have 13 engineers and we are looking to grow the team. We have a strong focus on people writing clean code, and working using an agile methodology. We work in very short rapid fire sprints - 1 to 2 weeks depending on the work we are doing. \nWe use Ruby as our core language and look for Full Stack developers who can think for themselves and enjoy working as a team - standard stuff but important for us to stress this.<p>You can learn more about the role here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;carwow.workable.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;207674\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;carwow.workable.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;207674</a><p>The interview process is: initial phone interview, tech test @ home, on-site 2-hour interview \nWe can also set up an initial coffee meeting&#x2F;call if you&#x27;d prefer to talk with someone on our tech team before applying.<p>Please get in touch by contacting talent@carwow.co.uk","time":1486046438,"type":"comment"}
