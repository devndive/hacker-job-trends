We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.<p>We&#x27;re a startup â€” we&#x27;re 18 people who have been working on this for almost 2 years. We&#x27;ve built an iOS app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.<p>We&#x27;ve raised $7M, and we&#x27;re looking to bring on a couple more talented engineers. Tech stack involves Ruby &#x2F; Rails and Javascript &#x2F; React Native. Email us at jobs@joinroot.com","time":1485970392,"type":"comment"}
