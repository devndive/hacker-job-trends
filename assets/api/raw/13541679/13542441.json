We have a strong focus on innovating in this space by blending conventional demographic data with bleeding-edge online behavior data and machine learning.<p>Our tech stack spans Leaflet.js and Vue.js for our browser-based mapping application to Ruby on Rails for account management to Python for data analysis and Docker&#x2F;Kubernetes for cluster management. We aim to hire generalists who can contribute in many ways but do have a few important gaps to fill:<p>- Ruby on Rails: Maintaining, refactoring, and&#x2F;or replacing our legacy code. This may not be full time work so it would be best if you could also help elsewhere. An eye for API design and security required.<p>- Docker&#x2F;Kubernetes: There are a number of potential projects which aim to improve our cluster configuration. AWS experience and interest in distributed system desired.<p>- Python: We have an internal service that will be taking on an external role and new responsibilities in the coming months and could use help accelerating the timeline. Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Postgresql experience required and Numpy&#x2F;Pandas, Celery recommended.<p>Our primary need is RoR and we are only considering contract positions at the moment but would also be happy to talk with talented individuals seeking interships.
