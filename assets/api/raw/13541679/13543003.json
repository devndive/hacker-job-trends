We are expanding our engineering team to meet rapidly growing demand, and looking for smart and friendly front-end and full stack developers with a breadth of experience. Everyone is given wide latitude and autonomy; see something that seems a bit off? Fix it and submit a pull request! Our tools serve thousands of field technicians and massive traffic to our customer portal.<p>Our stack is React, Node, and a little bit of Hack&#x2F;PHP, and we utilize Docker heavily for our development environments. I am a senior front-end dev on the engineering team, so check out our careers page and email me at parkera@icracked.com if you are interested in hearing more about our platform and how we work!","time":1485971340,"type":"comment"}
