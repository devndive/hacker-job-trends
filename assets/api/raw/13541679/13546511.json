We aren&#x27;t hung up on how old you are or whether or not you have a degree from the &#x27;right&#x27; school. We&#x27;re also right in the middle of Sunnyvale so relatively easy to get there from the South Bay.<p>On the down side you have to be US Citizen (sorry no green cards) and our salary flexibility is constrained by what is budgeted in the contract. One role is more data science focused doing feature extraction from real and synthetic data sets, and the other is more build a pipeline between multiple SDRs to visualize and quantify various radios that can be detected.<p>Principals only, we will not be able to accommodate any recruiters or placement services.<p>If you like interesting puzzles, have an affinity or interest in complex real time systems, you would find these opportunities interesting.<p>Stack: Vivado, C, ARM architectures, some C# and Java for some customer&#x27;s UI work.<p>email chuck.mcmanis@spectranetix.com if you would like to hear more.","time":1485991794,"type":"comment"}
