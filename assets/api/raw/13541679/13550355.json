Since 2011, we’ve been nose-down building a scalable platform that provides brands and retailers the ability to engage, reward and incent their consumers directly and across any channel – online, mobile and in-store. We pioneered the concept of card-linked-offers and have taken it to the next level – always-on loyalty. Both our self-service and SaaS-based platforms enable the creation of actionable ads, coupons, offers, promotions, rebates and more that let you reward loyalty... not just discount a purchase. This is the future of Loyalty.<p>* Technology Stack<p>Java, Spring, Sharded MySql, Hazelcast, RabbitMQ<p>* Additional Info<p>We&#x27;re wired into card networks and processors. We have a broad range of customers from grocery giant SuperValu where we&#x27;re deployed with a first of its kind card-linked SKU offer solution to FanBank where we help enable community based Loyalty programs.<p>We run an agile shop with 102 successful sprints under our belts. Our process has been improved over the 6 years we&#x27;ve been running it so that we deliver on time and without drama. Our engineers don&#x27;t sit in meetings they build solutions.<p>* Benefits<p>Health and dental benefits, 401K, Short&#x2F;Long Term disability insurance, Life insurance, Section 125 &amp; Section 132 plans, paid time off, stock options, remote work opportunities, other perks and a great work environment are part of the compensation package.<p>We&#x27;re looking for solid Java engineers to join our team and help us build out the next level of capabilities on our platform.<p>If this sounds interesting, please shoot me an email at coolgigs@linkablenetworks.com","time":1486042477,"type":"comment"}
