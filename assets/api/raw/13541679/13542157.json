Currently backed by top tier investors. Read about us: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fortune.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;10&#x2F;27&#x2F;superstar-investors-back-convo..\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fortune.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;10&#x2F;27&#x2F;superstar-investors-back-convo...</a>.<p>I&#x27;m employee #2, and I&#x27;ve been here since we were borrowing desks at a local startup incubator. We&#x27;ve grown a lot since then, but we still have a tight-knit, high leverage engineering team. I love arriving at the office in the morning - I get to work with the smartest folks I&#x27;ve ever met. No company I&#x27;ve ever been at, including Amazon, has felt like this much potential for impact.<p>We would love more engineers, up and down the stack, and anywhere on the generalist &lt;-&gt; specialist spectrum. We use pretty cutting-edge tech (React, React-Native for mobile, TypeScript + Node for backend), but we&#x27;re a lot more interested in engineering chops than any particular tech skills.<p>If you&#x27;re in Seattle, reach out and grab coffee with me or one of our other developers. The last 18 months have been a wild ride, but we have years and years ahead of us to build a logistics titan!<p>Some, but not necessarily all, of our open jobs: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.convoy.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.convoy.com</a>","time":1485966965,"type":"comment"}
