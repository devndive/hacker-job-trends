Some people call them chatbots, we think that&#x27;s a bit too simplistic. Conversations are hard and require more than what&#x27;s currently out there. We have a lot of traction with a good clientset and are showing no sig\nns of slowing down.<p>At the moment we&#x27;re a team of a bit over 20 people, but growing like crazy. We&#x27;re looking for all sorts of engineers, from front-end to ML and NLP. If you&#x27;re interested reach out to us at jobs@conversable.com!","time":1486160732,"type":"comment"}
