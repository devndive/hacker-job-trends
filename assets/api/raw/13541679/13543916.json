Yesterday we announced a new partnership with the ACLU: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13531707\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13531707</a><p>Here&#x27;s a secret most people don&#x27;t know: software is at the core of our plans for taking YC to the next level.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a couple of great hackers to join a small team in San Francisco working on these new projects. It&#x27;s not a job for everyone, but it would be a good fit for someone who loves startups. Working at YC, you won&#x27;t just write code, you&#x27;ll be involved in everything YC does.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of something interesting we built recently: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;themacro.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2016&#x2F;08&#x2F;investor-day-software&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;themacro.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2016&#x2F;08&#x2F;investor-day-software&#x2F;</a><p>If you&#x27;re a hacker, send us a note here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;1Od0T2l\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;1Od0T2l</a>.
