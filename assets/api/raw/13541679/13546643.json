Over the past couple of years, we&#x27;ve worked hard to migrate our entire web application stack to Node and powerful client-side apps and we&#x27;re looking to turn the dial towards product experimentation and innovation. We need your engineering ability and your desire to be a part of the whole product!<p>I’m a manager on the Online Checkout (that’s the “Pay with PayPal” button and experience) engineering team. We&#x27;re looking for experienced JavaScript developers. My team is currently working primarily with Angular on the client and Kraken on Node. If you&#x27;ve got experience with React, we&#x27;re actively exploring doing an inside-out migration of our application and could use your expertise. As most Node shops go, we&#x27;re leveraging a whole lot of other open source tools as well and we&#x27;re very supportive of open source activities for our people.<p>We have several openings within my team as well as within other teams--so drop me a line even if my particular opening doesn&#x27;t sound interesting and I&#x27;ll help you find the right place!
