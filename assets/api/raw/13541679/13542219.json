We power small companies from places like YC and Techstars to major banks and Fortune 100 companies.\nWho we&#x27;re looking for: As a full stack developer at Phaxio, you will be working with a variety of technologies on the front and back end. We recently rewrote our API in Rails and just rolled out a whole new look and feel.<p>On an average day you might find yourself: - Updating chef recipes to deploy a new service\n- Working to add a new feature to our Rails web dashboard or the flagship API\n- Tweaking our packer or vagrant development setup to optimize dev time for other engineers\n- Using Wireshark to diagnose issues with one of our carriers\n- Improving fabric scripts we use to automate our infrastructure on AWS\n- Answering a technical support ticket that involves a feature you created\n- Work on an open source library that helps developers or even non-technical end-users integrate with Phaxio<p>For interviews: After a brief conversation to make sure that we&#x27;re all on the same page, we&#x27;ll send over an interesting issue for you to diagnose and solve. Nobody looking over your shoulder or breathing down your neck :)<p>If you&#x27;re interested, send an email to howard at Phaxio.com","time":1485967259,"type":"comment"}
