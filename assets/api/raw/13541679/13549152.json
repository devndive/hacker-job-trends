Located in Paris, 50m from Place d&#x27;Italie, our offices are quiet (no open space!), bright, and you can get three monitors.<p>We are a C#&#x2F;.NET shop, and you will be developing under Visual Studio, the source code being versioned in Git. Our apps are hosted on Microsoft Azure. In addition, with the arrival of .NET Core, we also anticipate a few strategic migrations towards Linux.<p>We expect you to have strong software development skills. As a bonus, we appreciate people with a taste for low-level high performance computing, for compiler design and implementation, or for distributed systems. Contributions to open source projects are also highly regarded.<p>If you are interested, please reach out at victor.nicollet@lokad.com (I&#x27;m the CTO) with your resume, and we will schedule a short interview over Skype, followed by an in-person interview in Paris. We are mostly looking for candidates from Europe, but are willing to sponsor a visa for truly exceptional candidates.","time":1486026494,"type":"comment"}
