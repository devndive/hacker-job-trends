Our goal is to use whole-cell models to transform bioengineering and medicine into rigorous, quantitative disciplines. Our work is highly interdisciplinary, involving systems biology, genomics, bioinformatics, data integration, parallel simulation, optimization, software engineering, and data visualization, and highly team-oriented.<p>We are looking for scientists and engineers to help develop several technologies, including a domain-specific language for describing whole-cell models, a parallel multi-algorithmic simulator, scalable tools for visualizing and analyzing high-dimensional simulation results, and tools for handling personal `omics data.<p>More information: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.karrlab.org&#x2F;join\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.karrlab.org&#x2F;join</a> or Jonathan Karr (karr@mssm.edu)<p>How to apply: Send a cover letter and a CV to Jonathan Karr (karr@mssm.edu)","time":1486051571,"type":"comment"}
