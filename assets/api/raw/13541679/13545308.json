PolicyStat’s mission is to improve healthcare delivery by making those policies and procedures easier to find, access, and enhance. Our clients (across 46&#x2F;50 states) use our SaaS application to ensure that this critical information is correct, their staff can find it, and that it supports regulatory compliance.<p>In this role as our 5th engineer, an experienced software engineering generalist, you will be a critical part of our engineering team. You will spend time on all aspects related to delivering a great web application to our users. We&#x27;re a small team, so you&#x27;ll sometimes be asked to wear hats ranging from API design to algorithms and libraries to front-end engineering.  We’ve recently been freed from the tyranny of supporting Old IE, and we’re excited for the opportunity to improve interaction for the hundreds of thousands of people that rely on PolicyStat.<p>Tech stack:  Django, Python, JavaScript, React, Trello, Hipchat, Vagrant, GitHub, Chef<p>We are a remote-friendly team, currently with members in Indianapolis, Vancouver, Brasov, Barcelona, and elsewhere.<p>Our interview process is mainly work sample based: one short screening work sample, human interviews, then a 3-4 hour work sample using our tech stack. No whiteboarding involved.<p>Interested?
