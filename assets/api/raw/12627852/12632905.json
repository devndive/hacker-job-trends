We help healthcare providers close the feedback loop by routinely following up with their patients after major surgeries or treatments using patient-reported outcome surveys and other forms of digital check-ins. We process and visualize the data to help care teams deliver more personalized, proactive and value-driven care. We&#x27;re in a huge and growing market as reimbursement shifts from doctors getting paid for doing more, to getting paid based on their actual patient outcomes.<p>We have a launched HIPAA-compliant product with our first paying customers. We&#x27;re looking for a technical lead (and potential co-founder) to help us take things to the next level, help define our future product and make it happen. In particular we&#x27;re searching for someone who can work across our JavaScript stack (AWS&#x2F;Aptible&#x2F;MongoDB&#x2F;Node&#x2F;Angular&#x2F;React&#x2F;D3), understands security best practices, has experience in building self-service products, can lay the foundations to grow our team and is motivated to solve some of the toughest challenges in healthcare.<p>As a bootstrapped company we have a lot of flexibility and aim to raise our first round of funding early next year. As such this is primarily an equity-based proposition but an opportunity to get in at the ground floor of a company that is already up and running.<p>Interested? Please email me at francis AT outcomes.com (founder and medical doctor) - I look forward to hearing from you!","time":1475547682,"type":"comment"}
