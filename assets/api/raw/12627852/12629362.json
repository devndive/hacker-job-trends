The internship would allow you to follow consultants on the job as well as lead your own research project.<p>Who are we? We are consultants! Big companies come to us and ask us to hack their stuff (legally), review their code and advise on their design. If we’re not doing that, we spend our time reading papers, researching, attending conferences, giving talks and teaching classes, ... whatever floats our boat. Not one week is like the other! If you’ve spent some time doing cryptopals challenges you will probably like what we are doing.<p>We can’t say much about who are the clients we work for, except for the public audits we sometimes do. For example we’ve performed public audits for TrueCrypt, OpenSSL, Let’s Encrypt, Docker and more recently Zcash.<p>I was myself the first intern of Cryptography Services and I’d be happy to answer any question you might have =)<p>If you&#x27;re interested, take a look at the challenges we have in place: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptoservices.github.io&#x2F;challenges&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptoservices.github.io&#x2F;challenges&#x2F;</a><p>You can also directly contact me here: david.wong@nccgroup.trust !","time":1475515169,"type":"comment"}
