It was about 1 year ago, and we&#x27;re growing, that&#x27;s why we need more Engineers, Data Scientists, QAs with automation experience (you need to be really good at that, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s even closer to Software Engineer - IMO). Check out official page: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.grandrounds.com&#x2F;life-at-grand-rounds&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.grandrounds.com&#x2F;life-at-grand-rounds&#x2F;</a><p>Join us to see how Big Data is changing Health Care! We&#x27;re on OSS, using Ruby on Rails, just started using React in our web apps. We usually use Linux and ThinkPad laptops. Our code looks good, we have lots of tests (all of them green), and you&#x27;ll never understand what it is if you won&#x27;t apply! Interview process looks standard: calls, technical screening, on-site.<p>What else? I&#x27;d say we are mid-sized, and according to Glassdoor, GR is one of the best companies to work for in San Francisco (~5 star rating). If I&#x27;m not mistaken, we don&#x27;t do H1Bs, but OK with H1B transfer.<p>Feel free to send me your technical resume and&#x2F;or reach out if you have any questions about engineering here: roman.pushkin[at]grandrounds.com (no recruiters, please)","time":1475509109,"type":"comment"}
