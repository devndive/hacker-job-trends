After releasing Mother &amp; the motion cookies 2014, we’ve just unveiled the ThermoPeanut, a smart wireless thermometer and the first of the SensePeanut family, a range of easy-to-use BLE sensors.<p>We’re looking for:<p>- An Android Developer. You would be working on the SensePeanut companion app, integrating the upcoming members of the SensePeanut family as well as developing new features for the existing ones. We’re especially looking for people with experience connecting BLE devices and working with REST APIs. An experience building an SDK is a big bonus.<p>- A Python&#x2F;Devops engineer, to help us improve and scale our backend architecture. You would be maintaining and scaling out our infrastructure, as well as working on some of our backend services, so you&#x27;d have to care for both the &quot;dev&quot; and the &quot;ops&quot; part of the job. Our stack is mostly python-based, with heavy use of Django, Rabbitmq, Mysql, Cassandra and MongoDB.<p>We’re a relatively small team (12 people, of which 7 engineers), working on all parts of the product, so you’d have the opportunity to take part and learn about multiple aspects of the process.<p>If this sounds like something you’d like, please shoot us an email at jobs@sen.se, or see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sen.se&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sen.se&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs</a> (in French for now) for more info.","time":1475512803,"type":"comment"}
