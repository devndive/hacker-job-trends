If you don&#x27;t know about Microsoft culture, we&#x27;ve got a ton of smart people and the atmosphere supports people through the good and bad times in their life, while enabling them to be successful.<p>The only thing worth noting is that most of the jobs at Microsoft when it comes to &quot;build products&quot; tends to be in Redmond, WA. We do have dev centers in other places like our ALM group in NC, or Xamarin mobile team in Boston, but again I just mean &quot;majority&quot; not all when I say &quot;Redmond&quot; :).","time":1475526908,"type":"comment"}
