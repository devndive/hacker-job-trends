Managers and co-workers can easily perform fundamental day-to-day parts of their work on the app by sending messages, making announcements, swapping shifts, and assigning tasks. Today, these organizations are often using a combination of chaotic text message chains and paper to perform these actions. Crew instead presents a unified, powerful, and simple app-based solution.
