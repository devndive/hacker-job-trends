We give surgeons the technology that takes NFL quarterbacks to the Super Bowl™. We have many paying customers and the best people and partners in tech.<p>If you are strong in math and computer science and have 5+ years of professional software experience, you&#x27;ll fit right in. Production full-stack JavaScript experience wouldn&#x27;t hurt either. You can check out our tech stack here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;rqTl31\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;rqTl31</a> . If our tech stack sounds exciting to you, right on. It&#x27;s exciting to us too!<p>But to get past the honeymoon, you&#x27;ll need be excited about massively improving healthcare. When surgeons use C-SATS, their technical skills improve. Better numbers across the board: mortality rates, operating room time, blood loss, readmission rates, et cetera. These tangible results matter to us and they should matter to you, too.<p>I&#x27;m Adam Monsen. I run engineering and I&#x27;m the hiring manager.
