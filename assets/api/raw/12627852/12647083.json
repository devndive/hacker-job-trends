Think Google Sheets, but like this: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alphasheets.com&#x2F;videos&#x2F;headliner.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alphasheets.com&#x2F;videos&#x2F;headliner.gif</a>\nYou can check more examples out at alphasheets.com.<p>AlphaSheets marries the capabilities of spreadsheets (simple WYSIWYG calculation interface) with the full power of programming. We&#x27;ve gotten excitement from wall street quants, marketing analysts, pharmaceutical scientists, insurance analysts. Our broader audience is the burgeoning population of people who can write small bits of code but aren&#x27;t full-on software engineers. We envision a future where tens of millions of people with these skills see AlphaSheets as their tool of choice for data analysis.\nShort video demo: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;d.pr&#x2F;i&#x2F;jK28.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;d.pr&#x2F;i&#x2F;jK28.gif</a><p>1 yr+ React experience is a must. We have a React+ES6+Flow &#x2F; Haskell stack. We love seeking leverage through good architecture, languages (Haskell!), frameworks, and tools. (Doesn&#x27;t matter at all for this position if you don&#x27;t know Haskell.) We&#x27;re well funded (big seed round) and have 3 years&#x27; runway so we&#x27;re not going away overnight.\nOur culture is one of efficient, open communication and rational decision making. You&#x27;ll be joining a founding team of 4 guys out of MIT.<p>Email our CTO (Anand Srinivasan) at anand (at) alphasheets (dot) com","time":1475696476,"type":"comment"}
