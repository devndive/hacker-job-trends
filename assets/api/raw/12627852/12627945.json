We are profitable, fast growing and largely bootstrapped. Supply chains are incredibly complex, and we need a compilation engineer to get those challenges addressed at scale.<p>At Lokad, you will benefit from the coaching of an awesome dev team. You will gain skills in modern compiler design, and how to compile with a cloud platform as your target. Our codebase is clean, documented and heavily (unit) tested. Our offices are quiet (no open space!), bright, and you can get three monitors.<p>We are a C#&#x2F;.NET shop, and you will be developing under Visual Studio, the source code being versionned in Git. Our apps are hosted on Microsoft Azure. With .NET Core coming this year, we anticipate a few strategic migrations toward Linux.<p>We expect a vivid interest for compilation. A taste for low-level high performance computing and distributed systems is also a big plus. Contributions to open source projects are also highly regarded. We are located 50m from Place d&#x27;Italie in Paris (France).<p>To apply, drop me a mail at joannes.vermorel@lokad.com (I am the founder)","time":1475507430,"type":"comment"}
