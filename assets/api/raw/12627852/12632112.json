Hunter and Schmidt did a meta-study of 85 years of research on hiring criteria. [1]\nThere are three attributes you need to select for to identify performing employees in intellectual fields.<p><pre><code>  - General mental ability (Are they generally smart)\n    Use WAIS or if there are artifacts of GMA(Complex work they&#x27;ve done themselves) available use them as proxies. \n    Using IQ is mostly illegal[2] in the US, so you&#x27;ll have to find a test that acts as a good proxy.\n\n  - Work sample test. NOT HAZING! As close as possible to the actual work they&#x27;d be doing. Try to make it apples-to-apples comparison across candidates. Also, try and make accomidations for candidates not knowing your company shibboleth.\n\n  - Integrity. The first two won&#x27;t matter if you hire  a sociopath.\n\n     There are existing tests available for this, you can purchase for &lt; $50 per use.</code></pre>\nThis alone will get you &gt; 65% hit rate [1], and can be done inside of three hours. There&#x27;s no need for day long (or multi-day) gladiator style gauntlets.<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mavweb.mnsu.edu&#x2F;howard&#x2F;Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%20Validity%20and%20Utility%20Psychological%20Bulletin.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mavweb.mnsu.edu&#x2F;howard&#x2F;Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%...</a><p>[2] The illegality comes from IQ tests disadvantaging certain minority groups.<p>[3] Yes, I&#x27;m currently taking freelance work.","time":1475536048,"type":"comment"}
