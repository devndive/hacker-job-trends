Job-seekers only have to fill out one application for thousands of jobs positions. They don’t even have to apply for jobs themselves as employers can reach out instead. Our platform helps both sides in this process with features like text-to-apply and job interview scheduling while employers can easily keep track of applicants all the way to the on-boarding process.<p>Our engineering department is looking for a junior&#x2F;mid-level front-end developer to help us roll-out the multitude of features we have planned. We work in a pretty standard React.js&#x2F;Webpack stack with Alt.js providing our flux implementation. We’re looking for someone who has made something interesting with React on the side and understands their way around a single page app.<p>We’ll start the interview process with a phone interview followed by coming into the office.<p>Apply at Angelist: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;higherme&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;100150-frontend-developer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;higherme&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;100150-frontend-developer</a>","time":1475520027,"type":"comment"}
