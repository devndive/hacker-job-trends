We’re on a mission to make world-class healthcare convenient and accessible to all of humanity.<p>With Akira, Canadians will be able to consult with physicians on-demand by secure text or video. They will have mobile access to their health records, including labs, imaging, doctor’s notes, and prescriptions. And they will have a Personal Health Assistant who will focus on preventing illness, rather than simply treating it.<p>Based in Toronto, we’re building an interdisciplinary team of physicians, developers, data scientists and designers to tackle hard problems in healthcare technology. Our mobile health platform - launching in early 2016 in Canada - will bring much-needed change to a medical system still reliant on fax machines and paper charts.<p>Our long-term goal is to double the average global human lifespan by automating the delivery of medical advice and treatment.<p>If you&#x27;re passionate about moving healthcare forward, email me at alex@akira.md or apply at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;akira.md&#x2F;about.html#careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;akira.md&#x2F;about.html#careers</a>","time":1459560801,"type":"comment"}
