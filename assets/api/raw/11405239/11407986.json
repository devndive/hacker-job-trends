Our customers include many of the leading car manufacturers. We are offering frameworks, applications, gateways and tools for all major automotive networks (CAN, MOST, FlexRay, LIN, Ethernet). For ethernet solutions we are are covering control protocols (e.g. SOME&#x2F;IP, Thrift, OEM-protocols or also HTTP and websocket based for web connectivity) as well as audio&#x2F;video streaming protocols (AVB). We are not only focussed on the classical embedded automotive technology but also try to take modern consumer, web and IoT technology tech into concern to deliver the best possible solutions.<p>Our domain and technology stack is very broad. We are working on everything between embedded software for microcontrollers with RTOS (C&#x2F;C++), Linux and QNX Kernel drivers (C), user-space applications and daemons (mostly C&#x2F;C++, some Golang and node.js - but might get more in future), developer tools (mostly C#) and web user interfaces (js&#x2F;ts).<p>We are looking for engineers for software development and testing that feel comfortable in any or multiple of these domains. Experience in automotive software is not necessarily required, but a good understanding of system-level or embedded software and network stacks is desired.<p>Some further information can be found on <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cetitec.com&#x2F;careers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cetitec.com&#x2F;careers.html</a>.","time":1459540247,"type":"comment"}
