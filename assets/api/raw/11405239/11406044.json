Standing alone, each component does little to solve complicated problems in research, development, and clinical care. Epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, depression, Parkinson’s Disease and other neurologic conditions affect one in six people worldwide. Without the ability to work collaboratively with this data in an integrated manner, and in the relevant context including links to metadata, teams of researchers and clinicians are prevented from making fundamental discoveries that advance the field toward better medicines, devices and care delivery approaches. Blackfynn’s Data Management Platform solves this problem by enabling data integration and collaborative science. Help us solve this problem, and you will help improve the lives of tens of millions of people worldwide living with neurologic illness.<p>We’re a small team (4 today), well funded, and we’re looking for a fronted engineer, a full stack engineer, and a UX designer. We’re based in Old City in Philadelphia. Our stack today is Java, JS, Polymer all on AWS.<p>Questions - please email tom@blackfynn.com","time":1459527844,"type":"comment"}
