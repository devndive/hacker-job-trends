We think spreadsheets haven&#x27;t reached their full potential as a general computing platform. We envision a world where many more people are able to code thanks to the intuitive interface of a spreadsheet, where non-technical and technical analysts can share the same interface to data, and where everything from fully-featured data analysis and visualization apps to new spreadsheet functions can be shared, Google-Sheets style, on the AlphaSheets platform. We&#x27;re an ambitious company with plenty of runway.<p>Short video demo: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;d.pr&#x2F;i&#x2F;jK28.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;d.pr&#x2F;i&#x2F;jK28.gif</a><p>If you&#x27;re an opinionated functional programming proponent who hacks in Scala, Clojure, or Haskell in their free time, that&#x27;s a great sign of a fit. Experience is a plus, but not a must as long as you&#x27;re really smart. Doesn&#x27;t matter if you don&#x27;t know Haskell as long as you can learn. We have a React&#x2F;Flow&#x2F;Haskell stack. We love seeking leverage through good architecture, languages (Haskell!), frameworks, and tools.<p>You&#x27;ll be joining a team of 4 MIT dropouts (among them, one owned a multimillion-dollar Bitcoin mine in high school, two were USA Math Olympiad winners, and one made ~$300k on stat-arb trading in high school).<p>Email me (Michael Gao, CEO) at michael (at) alphasheets (dot) com","time":1459619434,"type":"comment"}
