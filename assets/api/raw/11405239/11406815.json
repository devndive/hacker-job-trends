When you don&#x27;t understand why something happens are you filled with a need to dig deeper? We&#x27;re looking for an enthusiastic junior developer to join our team.<p>We (Rapid Tender) make software (Countfire) for the construction industry. I know, enterprise software doesn&#x27;t sound sexy but we do really interesting work. The technology you will learn includes (but is not limited to); python, flask, js, react, angular, sql, postgres and linux.<p>I&#x27;ve built the entire product by myself, so far, and I&#x27;m looking for somebody with a thirst for knowledge to be my sidekick. We will be collaborating directly and you will be given all the support you need to progress rapidly to an experienced developer. My expectation is that what you&#x27;re missing in experience, you will make up for in enthusiasm and a desire to learn.<p>Email aidan@rapidtender.com for more details.","time":1459532542,"type":"comment"}
