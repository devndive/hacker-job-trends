But the coolest is definitely this one:<p>&quot;Contribute to a next generation JavaScript library for indoor mapping, which utilizes WebGL, physics, indoor positioning, and wayfinding. The engineer will be responsible for adding new features and apply performance improvements to the existing code base. You will solve challenging problems like applying performant collision detection algorithms for UI elements, or creating a solution for turn-by-turn directions. We are changing the game for indoor mapping, positioning, and wayfinding, as well as some top-secret research ideas (Pst - there will be robots).<p>dsim@us.westfield.com","time":1459530485,"type":"comment"}
