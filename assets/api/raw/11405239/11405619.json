As a result, we have a very long waiting list of customers and no public presence or press--we&#x27;re focused on building and delivering. One of our founders is very technically talented and sold a company before, and the other was the Chief of Staff at Dropbox.<p>1st engineer: (very significant equity possible)<p>We&#x27;re looking for an amazingly talented, productive engineer. There&#x27;s an opportunity to work on everything from really interesting NLP &#x2F; ML problems to much simpler features that make a real direct impact on customers, and help shape and grow the engineering team (looking to expand.) Strong familiarity with Python is a requirement, and familiarity with Django, AWS, PostgreSQL and Javascript are all bonuses.<p>Please email joshalbrecht@gmail.com<p>* Remote: if we find the right people, we might build a remote-first culture (we have experience with distributed teams)","time":1459525224,"type":"comment"}
