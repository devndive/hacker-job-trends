When I was looking for my next job, I thought of industries that were going to be very interesting in the next 5 years: VR, insurance, transportation and eSports. Smartcar falls under transportation and touches insurance; these are two massive industries ripe for disruption. Transportation is nearly 10% of US GDP.<p>Smartcar is building the universal API for the car. We enable developers from their dorm room to multi-billion dollar businesses to build custom applications for cars. For example: developers using our platform can create a service that automatically fuels up a driver&#x27;s car without the driver even having to know by accessing the telematics in the vehicle.<p>We&#x27;re a well funded startup with a 5 person team hailing from Google and LinkedIn looking to add 2 more.
