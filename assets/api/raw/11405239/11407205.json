My team at Upwork is hiring an intern for Summer 2016 and a Senior Software Engineer to help us build out our next generation platform. Along the way, you&#x27;ll get to work with people from all over the world (most of our engineering team works remotely) including world class engineers, product managers and designers. The post for the intern is available at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;dVMDmb\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;dVMDmb</a>. The post for the Senior Engineer isn&#x27;t up yet but it follows along the same lines as the intern post.<p>Feel free to apply via Jobvite or email me (email available in profile) directly.<p>P.S. - We are also looking for remote Java engineers to work with us, so if you&#x27;re interested, there&#x27;s that too :).","time":1459534906,"type":"comment"}
