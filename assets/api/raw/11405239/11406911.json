We make it easy for companies and developers to embed real-time video into their applications and websites. We build a platform and SDKs, and have great clients from individual developers to massive players in tech, entertainment, education, and many other industries (customers we can shout about from the rooftops include Chegg, Minerva Project, esurance, Major League Baseball, Double Robotics, and Fox Sports - but there are others we may be able to talk about behind closed doors :D). We&#x27;ve been doing real-time communications for over 8 years. We were acquired by Telefonica 3 years ago. It hasn&#x27;t changed the culture much, and has helped us reach more customers around the world. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the best of both the start up and corporate worlds rolled into one.<p>The product is the leader in the market, and the space is heating up which is exciting. But the people make this place where I work. It&#x27;s an awesome group of 70 or so people- nice, smart, skilled. We are laid back and have a sense of humor. Good salary, flexible, and great benefits!<p>We&#x27;ve hired a ton in 2015 and are continuing to hire in 2016. We&#x27;re looking a JavaScript engineer in Sydney (possibly SF?). For business development, we&#x27;re looking for people with strong experience in either fintech or healthcare to join us in San Francisco or London.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tokbox.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tokbox.com&#x2F;careers</a><p>or<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.jobvite.com&#x2F;m?3ZMiQhwF\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.jobvite.com&#x2F;m?3ZMiQhwF</a><p>Come join us!","time":1459533166,"type":"comment"}
