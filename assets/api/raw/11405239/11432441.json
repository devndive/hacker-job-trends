Over a billion people worldwide receive social protection or economic aid, but NGOs and governments operate anti-poverty programs without modern enterprise tools, resulting in significant fraud, waste, and delay. Our beneficiary enrollment and payment products dramatically improve the distribution of essential resources to those who are hardest to reach.<p>Segovia is a venture-backed, mission-driven, for-profit company, and we are hiring exceptional full-stack software engineers who share in our vision. Our team includes the founders of cash transfer charity GiveDirectly and early engineers from Facebook and Foursquare. Our investors include Reid Hoffman, Omidyar Network, and Global Innovation Fund.<p>Press | <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tcrn.ch&#x2F;1LUe5s1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tcrn.ch&#x2F;1LUe5s1</a> | <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bloom.bg&#x2F;1MsHwT3\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bloom.bg&#x2F;1MsHwT3</a> | <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;1Q7dMh2\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;1Q7dMh2</a><p>Apply | <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thesegovia.recruiterbox.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;fk0hqg5&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thesegovia.recruiterbox.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;fk0hqg5&#x2F;</a>","time":1459877491,"type":"comment"}
