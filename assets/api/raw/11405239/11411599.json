All they have is Craigslist or local offline brokers who operate the same way they did in the 1990&#x27;s. Vestable be the online marketplace that solves so many of their pain points by leveraging a variety of web services and harnessing digital customer acquisition. The result will be large efficiency gains in terms of timing, effort, and pricing.<p>I was a co-founder of Fundera which is an online marketplace for small business loans (backed by Khosla, First Round, QED, Susquehanna, and others). A very similar blueprint will be applied to this marketplace. Previously I started two other companies that were acquired.<p>Looking for a full-stack engineer who has experience building web applications. You&#x27;ll be building from a blank canvas, and thus any development language will work. You&#x27;ll be the co-founder and CTO of the company.<p>Please email me directly at andres@vestable.com.
