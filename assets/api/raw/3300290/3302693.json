Opinionated and respected in our space, with passionate users.  Bootstrapped and profitable with influential clients and a relatively complex/mature product.  Funding and significant growth are likely in our near (6mo) future, though we're hiring now either way.<p>You are: our second full-time hire, supplementing an overworked technical founder.  A developer who can handle setting foot in inner city schools on a weekly basis (gotta understand the end users!).  Experience in any specific language/technology is less important to us than your ability to dive in and take ownership of our (somewhat unique) stack.  Passionate about writing good code.","time":1322800170,"type":"comment"}
