You’ll need to get creative and invent new algorithms, not just apply known techniques.  There are still big, interesting problems to solve that are central to our product.<p>Unlike much of computer science, computer vision is about messy data and uncertain results, so you’ll need to work well with that.  Past experience in computer vision or a related field such as machine learning is preferable.  Experience with high-performance code (optimization, parallelization, CUDA) is a plus.  Our codebase is primarily in C++.","time":1322782517,"type":"comment"}
