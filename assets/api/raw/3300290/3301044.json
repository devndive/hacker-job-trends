We rate people, and determine whether they are\nsafe to deal with in-person on collaborative Peer-To-Peer marketplaces (think AirBnb or Tutorspree). We raised a seed round from a bunch of awesome Angels/VCs. Now we are looking to bring on our first couple engineers - salaried, but since we're early, we can offer a nice amount of equity.<p>Here are the general descriptions of what we're looking for:<p>- Front-end engineer (we do Rails/HAML/SASS/JQuery). Optimally he/she would have some design ability in addition to being able to do the front-end implementation.<p>- Service-layer generalist engineer. We are integrating with and pulling data from a lot of services, so we need\nsomeone to build all of those integrations in a flexible and scalable way.<p>If this sounds interesting, contact us at: jobs@getscaffold.com","time":1322767384,"type":"comment"}
