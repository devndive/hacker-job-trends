H1B ok.<p>RetailNEXT (<a href=\"http://bviretailnext.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bviretailnext.com</a>)<p>We are google analytics for the real-world. We use a combination of machine vision (OpenCV + our own algorithms) on standard video cameras, and other inputs like RFID/WiFi data to build a complete picture of what's happening inside a physical retail store. No cookies or IPs to play with in the real-world, so a much harder (and hence much more interesting!) problem.<p>Each month we track nearly 2M people worldwide across our several retail customers (a few are listed on our website). We are fundamentally changing the way retail stores are designed and operated.<p>We use C/C++, Java, Python and Flex. Our product runs on Linux. We like super-smart generalist hackers who are into machine vision, data visualization, AI or data mining/big data analytics. Interested?
