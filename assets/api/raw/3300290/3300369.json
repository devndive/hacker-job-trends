If you're interested in working remotely, you must live in the U.S. H1B is okay. We also have some summer internship opportunities.<p>Factual aims to be the place where people meet to share, improve, and mash-up data. Our vision is to be an awesome and affordable data provider, so that big companies, startups, and developers can focus on innovation instead of data acquisition.<p>We have a terrific team that is still fairly small, and an incredible CEO (he was the co-founder of Applied Semantics, which was sold to Google and became AdSense). Last year we raised a Series A from Andreessen-Horowitz, and our customers and partners include Facebook, Loopt, SimpleGeo, and Newsweek. We have lots of challenging problems to work on at all layers of the stack: data cleaning and canonicalization, deduping, storage, serving, APIs, etc. If you love data, Factual is the place to be.<p>We currently have about half a dozen job openings, from data engineering to software engineering to system administration. For the software engineering position, you would ideally know Java, Clojure, and/or Ruby, and you'll get bonus points for experience with machine learning, NoSQL, algorithms, infrastructure, and/or Hadoop.<p>If you're interested in the Bay Area office, it just opened last weekend, so you'd have a significant influence on the culture there.<p>You can email me personally at leo -at- factual.com, or view our job postings and apply directly via Jobvite:<p>Los Angeles Software engineer: <a href=\"http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oQR1Vfwn&#38;s=Hackernews\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oQR1Vfwn&#38;s=Hackernews</a><p>Los Angeles Data Engineer: <a href=\"http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oSS1Vfwq&#38;s=Hackernews\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oSS1Vfwq&#38;s=Hackernews</a><p>Palo Alto Software Engineer: <a href=\"http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oTR1Vfwq&#38;s=Hackernews\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oTR1Vfwq&#38;s=Hackernews</a>","time":1322758661,"type":"comment"}
