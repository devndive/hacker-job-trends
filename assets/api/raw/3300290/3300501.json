(<a href=\"http://samurai.feefighters.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://samurai.feefighters.com</a>) It's an all-in-one all-in-one solution for taking payments online. It has come out of the gate swinging - there is a ton of pent-up demand to fix this industry and we're excited at how many people have been interested in our new product. We have a few more tricks up our sleeve and need developers to help build them out!<p>We have passionate users, awesome investors and partners, and products that our customers love. We pay ourselves decent salaries, are generous with equity and we enjoy a very fun and stimulating work environment. Much of the Samurai dev team was early on in another payments startup that grew to be a $2Billion company (including the CIO of that company).
