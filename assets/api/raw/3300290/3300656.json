This trend results in loss of control and visibility causing existing solutions to be inadequate and presents new challenges in application performance management for organizations.<p>At ThousandEyes, we believe that one does not have to sacrifice visibility and control when adopting distributed architectures and cloud services. To this end we are building a novel platform that truly understands the infrastructure layer underneath complex distributed applications as well as the end to end application delivery. Our core technology is a combination of active probing by exploiting protocols to extract critical data as well as passive techniques such as capturing traffic to infer network and application metrics. We are a team of radical thinkers and hackers and our core principle is to out innovate our competitors. We are actively looking for like minded people who enjoy hacking protocols and are passionate about disrupting the performance management space through our next generation platform.<p>Open positions:\n* Frontend Software Engineer\n* Java Software Engineer (Full Stack)\n* C/C++ Systems Software Engineer<p>Full details at <a href=\"http://www.thousandeyes.com/company/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.thousandeyes.com/company/careers</a><p>To apply please send your cv to jobs@thousandeyes.com together with a paragraph explaining what you can bring to ThousandEyes and a code sample if possible.","time":1322762220,"type":"comment"}
