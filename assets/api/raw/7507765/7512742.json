NLP experience (academic or practical) would be great, but a CS background is a must. If you&#x27;ve been exposed to data warehousing and business intelligence systems in the past without being driven insane that&#x27;s another plus.<p>Our team of four is based in Sheffield, Yorkshire - the greenest city in the UK, less than two hours from London. We have burritos - it&#x27;s a real place - but we spend some time working remotely and we&#x27;d work to accommodate the right candidate anywhere in the UK.<p>If you&#x27;d like to chat, get in touch with me, Thom Lawrence, at thom@delver.io.","time":1396398144,"type":"comment"}
