Visas possible, relocation required (no work from home).<p>120 engineers, ~450-500 employees overall.<p>We&#x27;re building flash-based storage arrays and are growing incredibly rapidly in the market. Technically still a startup, but at a more mature point; no 120-hour work weeks required. Best team I&#x27;ve ever worked with, fantastic velocity in the market. We&#x27;re the best array out there and it shows; we consistently beat other startups and established companies.<p>Despite producing hardware, we&#x27;re heavily a software shop, mostly C++; GUI is javascript, scripting support is Python.","time":1396391507,"type":"comment"}
