The latter is my team, and if you&#x27;re someone who&#x27;s bored with his&#x2F;her current enterprise-level job coding for the Microsoft stack and want something more challenging, I&#x27;d love to talk with you.<p>Our product involves some low-level hackery in C++&#x2F;C# on the Windows side, stuff like coding messages ourselves and feeding them to window handles, custom drivers, and other bits.  We need people who have a solid background with Windows architecture (MFC, Windows Forms, etc) and the drive to learn the rest.  If you&#x27;re looking to move up from a standard .Net job, this is a way to do it.<p>In return, we offer solid salaries and stock shares (we&#x27;re a public company!), a flat hierarchy with a great team, four weeks off, and very competitive games of FIFA on our XBox.  Additionally, we hate overtime.  I&#x27;ve never once been asked to stay late and crunch, though my work is fun enough that I&#x27;ll sometimes hack on the weekends anyway.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, please email a resume to andrew at hopto.com, along with a link to something you&#x27;ve built (either a web site, or a Github repo, or whatever).","time":1396383977,"type":"comment"}
