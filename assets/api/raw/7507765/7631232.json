Gliffy is established and quite profitable, but still operates like a startup (hackatons, quarterly outings, innovation days) and the founders are focused on satisfaction- both from customers and employees alike. They are based in SF and allow engineers to work from home Mondays and Fridays (alongside some other nice perks).<p>Check the link for the full job specs and feel free to email me if it sparks your interest.<p><a href=\"http://blocktalent.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/@profile-Gliffy-Sr.-Engineer-20142.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blocktalent.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2012&#x2F;12&#x2F;@profile-G...</a><p>Thanks-<p>Matt - matt@blocktalent.com","time":1398210832,"type":"comment"}
