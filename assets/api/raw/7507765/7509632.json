As we expand into more markets and launch commercially we&#x27;re looking to add a few more senior level roles.<p>- &quot;Designgineer&quot; ~ someone very comfortable with HTML and CSS. Ideally you have experience with UX &amp; design theory and an interest in data &amp; analytics visualizations.<p>- Data engineer ~ someone who can &quot;hadoopify&quot; our data. We&#x27;re sitting on an ever growing trove of CRE data.  We&#x27;re looking for someone to help take lead on building out the team, the tools, and the insights as we grow.<p>- &quot;Full Stack&quot; engineer ~ the engineering team so far is made up of experienced, focused individuals comfortable on all parts of the system.  We&#x27;d love to add another Sr. level full stack type who can hit the ground running &amp; add to our overall product-shipping speed while helping us grow our culture.<p>We use node.js, python, postgres, elastic search, and nsq currently but are happy to have more tools in our toolbox if they solve the problem.  We&#x27;re a close knit, easy to get along with team and all really excited about Reonomy!<p>I&#x27;m actually located remote and have worked this way for about 9 months, but I&#x27;m so stoked about how things are going I&#x27;m moving with my family from ATX to NYC next month to be closer to the action.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in talking more please shoot me an email at brian@reonomy.com with some details about you &amp; what position you&#x27;d like to talk about.
