March just came to a close and Buffer stands at 1.4M total users served by a small 21 person team spread across 14 cities and 5 continents. 130,000 of our users are actively using the product each month. We generated $350,000 in March, and we have $580,000 in the bank. The average salary at the company is $98,000 and our total funding to date is $450,000 which we raised in December 2011, for which we gave up 14% of the company. I&#x27;m sharing all of this because one of the highest values we have at Buffer is to be fully transparent, and I&#x27;d love for you to be part of the incredible journey we&#x27;ve embarked upon.<p>At 16% month over month revenue growth on average in the last 6 months, we&#x27;re seeing increasing demand to build out the product further and help our fast-growing customer base with all their social media problems. To achieve this, we&#x27;d love your help with some interesting engineering challenges.\nDo any of these areas stand out for you? I&#x27;d really love to hear from you:<p><pre><code>    - Reliability Hacker (we&#x27;re sending 450,000 posts to\n      social networks every day, our architecture is still\n      not ideal)\n    - Android Lead (our Android app has half a million\n      downloads but currently no full-time developer!)\n    - iOS Hacker (our favorite people who use Buffer are\n      all crying out for an iPad app)\n    - Growth Hacker (our landing page conversion is at 7%,\n      we&#x27;d love your help improving it and many other\n      metrics)\n    - Frontend Hacker (last month 130,000 people used\n      Buffer, we&#x27;d love to improve our dashboard interface\n      and extensions for them)\n</code></pre>\nSome of the tech we work with: PHP, Python, MongoDB, AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, Elasticache, SQS), Backbone.js, Grunt.js, Android, iOS).<p><pre><code>    - We&#x27;re completely open about salary and equity, in\n      fact here is a spreadsheet of all individual salaries:\n      https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;bufferapp.com&#x2F;spreadsheet&#x2F;ccc?key=0AgrWVeoG5divdE81a2wzcHYxV1pacWE1UjM3V0w0MUE&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=1.\n      It&#x27;s most likely you&#x27;d fall into a range of\n      $85,000-$150,000 and 0.1%-1%.\n    - We&#x27;re a fully distributed remote team, and we come\n      together 3 times a year for super fun retreats.\n      The last one was in Thailand in December, our next\n      is Cape Town in April!\n    - We have a big focus on culture, that&#x27;s the main thing\n      we think about when someone joins the team. Here is\n      our slide deck of values:\n      http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slideshare.net&#x2F;Bufferapp&#x2F;buffer-culture-03 \n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ll read through emails with our CTO Sunil, I hope yours might be part of that.
