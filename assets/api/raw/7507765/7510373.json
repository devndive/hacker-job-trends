We&#x27;re currently rolling out our first two installations — in Dubai and in Moscow. And we just grew to ten people.<p>Both the client part (iOS) and the video processing backend (Python&#x2F;ffmpeg) are being actively developed in-house. We&#x27;re currently looking for a Python developer, full-time in London. Our office is at TechHub (207 Old Street), in the heart of the Silicon Roundabout, but we&#x27;ll be moving to the new office in the same area very soon.<p>The usual job description blurb is at our landing page at <a href=\"http://www.fountain-digital.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fountain-digital.com</a>. I want to add that it&#x27;s a great opportunity for a backend developer to get involved in a very serious wide-scale project. We&#x27;re not in the business of making websites or Facebook apps, our video cloud routinely loads tens of large Amazon EC2 instances — and grows automatically as you add new video streams. We&#x27;re really doing interesting work here.<p>If you&#x27;ve never done Python in production, but love distributed systems, programming at scale and are a strong all-rounder — feel free to apply anyway. We love working with smart and hardworking people.<p>If you want to ask anything about the product, technology, or anything else, drop me a line (I&#x27;m the CTO). My email is in the profile.<p>No recruiters please.","time":1396375568,"type":"comment"}
