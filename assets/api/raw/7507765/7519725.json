Remote a possibility.<p>==============<p>Our goal is to improve decision-making at the boards of the world&#x27;s largest companies.<p>Most corporate boards are run ineffectively. Think how effective they <i>could</i> be, and think how much that could improve the ways companies are run. (Not just in terms of profitability, but also in terms of ethics and long-term value).<p>BI has a successful consulting business and now aims to become a high-growth tech business. Our app is used by CEOs and directors of some of the UK&#x27;s largest companies, and we&#x27;re now expanding internationally.<p>Culture: despite our corporate target market, we&#x27;re a young, small team (~15 people, 4 on the tech team, most employees in their 20s). Many of the non-tech team members have an interest in visual design or data visualisation, so there&#x27;s a strong product focus. Oh, and if you enjoyed Kahneman&#x27;s <i>Thinking Fast and Slow</i>, you&#x27;d probably fit right in. (About half the team has read it and it ties in closely with our work).<p>Site: <a href=\"http://boardintelligence.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;boardintelligence.co.uk</a><p>Email: Isaac.Lewis@boardintelligence.co.uk","time":1396480471,"type":"comment"}
