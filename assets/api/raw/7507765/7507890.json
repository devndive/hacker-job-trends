As a software developer, you would responsible for end-to-end product development, from architecture, to development, to rollout. You must be comfortable participating in design and code reviews, as well as delivering accurate estimates, providing regular development progress feedback and consistently meeting project deadlines. Our developers are effective at explaining complex ideas and concepts to non-technical team members.<p>This is a full time position that would work out of our downtown Detroit office. Occasional telecommuting (like one day a week) is on the table, but we really need people who can be in the office most of the time.<p>Here&#x27;s our stats:<p><pre><code>    Company size: 19\n\n    Current dev team size: 5 (and hiring as fast as we can find good people)\n\n    Stack: LAMP\n\n    Version Control: Git\n\n    Bug Tracking: Github Issues\n\n    Project Management: Basecamp\n\n    Mac or PC: Dealer&#x27;s choice. We currently have 2 devs on mac and 1 on PC.\n\n    Office style: Open floor plan, collaborative working environment, very casual.\n\n    Dev methodologies: We borrow elements of various frameworks, but in general we work in monthly sprint cycles, daily stand-ups, weekly overview meetings.\n\n    Hours: The dev team likes to have people here by 10am most days.\n</code></pre>\nA word about Detroit: The city gets a lot of bad press. It might not look like an attractive option to people who are considering offers from NY or CA, but I would really encourage people to at least take a look. We&#x27;re in a building with about 20 other tech start-ups who have all received funding.  There is serious investment happening in the city right now. Two months ago I looked up and Warren Buffet (completely unannounced) was 10 feet away from my desk (he&#x27;s partnering on several projects in the city). We sit right across from the Detroit Twitter office. We&#x27;re on the same block as the Detroit Google office. Comerica Park, where the Detroit Tigers play, is 100 yards from our office. Ford Field, where the Lions play, is another about 300 yards away. The part of the city we&#x27;re in is clean and safe with newly built downtown living alternatives. All I&#x27;m saying is: give it a look.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in finding out more, shoot me an email at evan@chalkfly.com.","time":1396358567,"type":"comment"}
