Our goal is to create the new global default for how men buy clothes. We&#x27;re live, have lots of customers who are obsessive about the product, and revenues are growing very quickly.<p>You won&#x27;t merely be handed specs: you&#x27;ll be in charge of taking ideas from the whiteboard all the way through to them being live, tracking the results, and iterating to make them better. For this reason, this role is only suitable for someone who likes being closely involved in product â€” what to build and how it will work, as much as the technical implementation itself.<p>You&#x27;ll work everyday with an awesome technology stack consisting of Python, Django, Git, Debian, Redis, jQuery, Jenkins, Postgresql, Gunicorn and many other things.<p>If this seems like you, there&#x27;s more information here: <a href=\"https://www.thread.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thread.com&#x2F;jobs</a> or email me at &lt;ben at thread.com&gt;","time":1396448271,"type":"comment"}
