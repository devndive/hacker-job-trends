If you&#x27;ve ever tried to answer the question &quot;Who do I know that&#x27;s...&quot; (looking for engineers, investing in my kind of company, interested in partnerships, able to get me featured on Google Play, etc) -- that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re about.<p>It&#x27;s a huge, nutty data problem -- our professional networks aren&#x27;t perfectly manicured, exemplary LinkedIn accounts, but disparate and scattered across multiple platforms. Plus there&#x27;s the task of really trying to understand <i>who</i> everyone is, and figuring out a product perspective that avoids spam and creepiness while genuinely building relationships and value for both sides.<p>We recently closed a seed round and we&#x27;re looking for a Python data engineer and a Rails developer. If you&#x27;re interested in a rolling up your sleeves at a really early-stage startup (with funding!), we&#x27;d love to hear from you.<p>On the data side, ideally you have some experience with using Python for data analysis, scaling data tools, API integrations, machine learning&#x2F;natural language processing, and ontologies. For Rails, we&#x27;re looking for an experienced engineer who can own our Rails stack and lead integrations with our data backend.<p>If you&#x27;d like to learn more, please get in touch. I&#x27;m jennie at close.co, and I&#x27;m the data engineer you&#x27;d be working directly with in either role. :)","time":1396369560,"type":"comment"}
