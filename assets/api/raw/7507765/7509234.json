Our focus is on the interpretation vertical: we provide a SaaS product for scheduling, hr, and financials for that sector. There’s TONS of interesting problems, and our customers love us!<p>We’re looking for our first full time engineering hire. As mentioned: if you’re in SF, great, but also let us know if you’re interested in a remote job.<p>* We’re a tiny team, so you’ll need to be at least comfortable with the full stack. It also means you&#x27;ll have a huge amount of influence on how things are done.<p>* Front-end expertise is critical: we have more code in our backbone.js layer than anywhere else, and so you should not only be an expert in javascript, but also know how to manage complex dependencies.<p>* Knowledge of a modern MVC framework. We use grails, but those skills are quite transferable. Java and Hibernate knowledge is a bonus.<p>* AWS and Elasticsearch knowledge would be awesome.<p>We have tons of interesting problems ahead of us, from implementing beautiful realtime dashboards to crunchy machine learning&#x2F;discrete optimization tasks.<p>Drop me a note at david@interpreterintelligence.com if you’re interested or have any questions.","time":1396367848,"type":"comment"}
