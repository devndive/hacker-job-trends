We used AJAX before it was called AJAX. The engineering “managers” aren’t really managers – they’re the ones who architected the products and lead their maintenance. Engineers in charge means no red tape or other silly productivity barriers like at larger companies.<p>While all of our engineers contribute across the stack, many draw assignments with a particular focus. As a Software Engineer (Client Focused), you would be a principal contributor in developing our next-generation eTMF product. The eTMF client is a classic web 2.0 “single page” application utilizing the current best of breed JavaScript libraries.<p>Wingspan values fundamentals and ability to learn over current knowledge, but candidates with knowledge and experience relevant to our current technology stack have an obvious advantage over those without.","time":1396358730,"type":"comment"}
