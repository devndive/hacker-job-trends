Funded by A-list investors, including Eric Schmidt&#x27;s Innovation Endeavors, DCM, and Lightspeed Venture Partners, Slice has attracted top talent and has been acquired by Rakuten, the #1 shopping site or Amazon of Japan. We are building the most powerful e-commerce data set in the world, and weâ€™re JUST getting started. We are hiring world-class senior software engineers, sales, technical leads, data analysts, and machine learning engineers. You will be surrounded by an elite team of seasoned entrepreneurs who foster an environment of innovation, creativity, and learning. You will play an instrumental role in product development, subsequent iterations, and launches, an opportunity not found in larger corporations. Slice provides the opportunity to network with and be mentored in a small 1:1 setting by industry veterans and investors in the the heart of Silicon Valley, and we want to rapidly expand our team in 2016.<p>Website: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.slice.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.slice.com&#x2F;</a><p>New video: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=oY8OKR85KMk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=oY8OKR85KMk</a><p>Resumes&#x2F;websites&#x2F;portfolios to sean+resumes@slice.com and hannahft [AT] stanfordalumni.org.<p>Delighted to address questions in an informational interview or call!","time":1449023798,"type":"comment"}
