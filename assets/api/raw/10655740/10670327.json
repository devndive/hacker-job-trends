More than half of the requests we observe per day are from automated systems. We have a global network and actively block traffic based on our bot &#x2F; human signatures. Our customers love us (and they pay us too!). Our investers love us. I (data scientist, employee 14) am pretty happy about working there too. Lots of problems and good people to work on them with.
