We currently have version 1.0 in the App Store and are looking to release version 2.0 around New Year&#x27;s. We recently completed a well known accelerator program in NYC and secured a 1mm seed round.<p>We&#x27;re looking for an iOS developer who takes equal pride in the quality of their code as they do in delivering delightful experiences. Knowledge of key tools and frameworks (Cocoa Pods, AFNetworking, etc) is required. Experience with legacy code bases is highly valued as well but not required.<p>Thanks so much for looking!
