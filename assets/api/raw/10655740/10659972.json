This involves running AWS instances, figuring out APIs, building a PostgreSQL data warehouse, and finally building various machine learning products from recommendation engines to using multivariate statistics to improve their understanding of their business. The latter part is the fun one but anybody who has done this will know 90% of the work is in the data warehouse.<p>I write some of the code but I mostly spend my time dealing with the clients and writing the functional specs for you.<p>You should be familiar with relational algebra and relational databases.  I recommend having a good knowledge of the topics covered in &quot;An Introduction to Statistical Learning&quot; (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-bcf.usc.edu&#x2F;~gareth&#x2F;ISL&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-bcf.usc.edu&#x2F;~gareth&#x2F;ISL&#x2F;</a>).  Most of our recent projects have been done with Haskell, Postgres and some bash.<p>You can usually name your price (per week), worst case the client will say no. Clients are all OK with never meeting you in person (in fact, my first client still hasnâ€™t met me).<p>If interested, please get in touch - email is in my profile. You can expect some technical discussion and potentially a little programming test.  If you can, please point to some public code you&#x27;ve written.","time":1449015822,"type":"comment"}
