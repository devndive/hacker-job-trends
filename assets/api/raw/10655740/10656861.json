We are hiring engineers and designers at our offices in Grand Rapids or Columbus.<p>A little bit about us:<p><pre><code>  - We aren&#x27;t limited to any really specific set of technologies, which is a great\n  opportunity to learn. In the past two years, I&#x27;ve worked with Python,\n  Objective-C, Angular + CoffeeScript, Node.js, and Ruby&#x2F;Rails.\n\n  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,\n  activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and &gt; 40 hour weeks are\n  rare by design. Last year I worked an average of 40.408 hours per week.\n\n  - We offer competitive salaries, top notch benefits, quarterly profit\n  sharing, and more.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love making software, and you have a couple of years of experience building\n  software with a variety of tools and technologies.\n\n  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not\n  afraid to use more. You have some experience with web or mobile tech.\n\n  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.\n\n  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.\n</code></pre>\nIf you&#x27;re interested, check out our website:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mutuallyhuman.com&#x2F;hiring&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mutuallyhuman.com&#x2F;hiring&#x2F;</a><p>Also, feel free to get in touch with me:<p>ej@mutuallyhuman.com","time":1448988895,"type":"comment"}
