In the process we&#x27;re helping them to feel happier and more confident about themselves. We&#x27;re backed by a collection of the top investors from London and Silicon Valley as well as Y Combinator.<p>You&#x27;d be joining a small, highly technical team with lots of startup experience (the founders have started and sold 2 companies before). We&#x27;re lucky to have had a lot of success bringing together exceptional people in design, machine learning&#x2F;AI and engineering, and we&#x27;re now focussed on finding our first dedicated frontend engineer. You’ll be responsible for owning the frontend code and helping shape how frontend is built, from working with designers through to integrating with the backend. You’ll also be responsible for evangelising the latest frontend technologies and techniques and bringing them into Thread where appropriate. We want to work with someone who is entrepreneurial, ambitious, has broad, cross-discipline interests, is product-focused and exceptionally good at what they do.<p>Want to learn more?
