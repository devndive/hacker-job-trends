Creating a better video codec is a difficult task, and creating one with unencumbered technology is even harder. We&#x27;ve achieved that goal for audio with Opus, but video is still dominated by royalty bearing codecs like H.264.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a Senior Research Engineer to join us building Daala, a next-next generation video codec being developed by Mozilla Research in conjunction with the Xiph.Org Foundation. Daala uses lapped transforms, overlapped-block motion compensation, frequency-domain prediction, gain-shape (perceptual) vector quantization, , and non-binary arithmetic coding to achieve superior performance.<p>If you like low level code, numeric programming, signal processing, algorithms, or machine learning, you&#x27;d probably enjoy working on Daala.<p>More details and to apply:\n<a href=\"https://careers.mozilla.org/en-US/position/oNOsZfwM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;position&#x2F;oNOsZfwM</a>","time":1409583644,"type":"comment"}
