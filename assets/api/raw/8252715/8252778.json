Shortcut is all about making live event concessions better. $50B goes through concessions every year. No one knows who spends this money. We want to give this data to the venue while at the same time make life easier for the attendee.<p>Shortcut is founded by early employees of Eventbrite and Uber. We allow attendees at live events to order food&#x2F;drink&#x2F;merchandise from their phone. They can then have it delivered to them or pick it up via a fast lane.<p>We have just completed the Techstars program and raised a seed round (which is not public until late September).<p>This is mainly a Rails job, but there would be portions of Android &#x2F; iOS once in a while.<p>Tasks:<p><pre><code>  * Lead by example – by writing good code, talking about good code, and then drinking beers with the team to celebrate all the good code everyone wrote\n  * Design and development of new product features and enhancements\n  * Know what technologies are out there in case you need to use them\n  * Periodically teach your co-workers all the great stuff you learned via tech talks, brown bags, blogs or open source\n</code></pre>\nRequirements:<p><pre><code>  * You ideally have Ruby on Rails experience with at least working knowledge of Android.\n  * You want to work in a startup (a.k.a. a place that works hard and plays hard)\n  * You feel comforted when you write a good unit test\n  * You must have a Bachelor’s knowledge level of computer science via education or experience\n  * You know when to use Postgres&#x2F;Mysql vs Mongodb&#x2F;Redis\n  * You understand the full stack (servers, RoR, javascript&#x2F;css&#x2F;html)\n\n</code></pre>\nShoot me an email at buford@shortcutapp.com","time":1409579269,"type":"comment"}
