They are growing fast and are now in need of a skilled full stack software engineer to take this MVP to the next level.  The current platform is a mixture of open software (linux, influxdb) and Java.  So far on this project I have worked on debugging device drivers to building graphs in D3.js and everything in between.  The right person will not only have a huge impact on the choice of languages and direction of the platform but potentially the electric car industry.  Local south-bay preferred, but the right person could work remotely.<p>Contact: owen at projectrenovo.com","time":1409596749,"type":"comment"}
