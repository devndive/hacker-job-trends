As one of the few companies with direct access to the Twitter Firehose as well as the full Facebook and Google+ APIs, we face unique UI problems that you&#x27;ll help solve with your keen sense of design and attention to detail. You&#x27;ll be architecting new features and workflows that our customers will use to pull valuable insight out of hundreds of billions of social media posts.<p>There&#x27;s no precedent for a lot of what we do. Familiarity with modern JavaScript frameworks is a plus, but not a requisite-- We value your ability to think laterally, collaborate, communicate, and execute above everything. We like people who have a background in freelancing. We also like people who come to programming via nontraditional means.<p>Top pay, top benefits, located in Boston&#x27;s Seaport district. We&#x27;re big enough not to be a monoculture, but small enough not to be a corporate cult.<p>Email me (alex at crimsonhexagon dot com) or check out our hiring page: <a href=\"http://goo.gl/oSIY3o\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;oSIY3o</a>","time":1409586866,"type":"comment"}
