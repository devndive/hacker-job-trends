We use computer vision at a massive scale, on a large number of rich and ubiquitous video feeds, to understand what is going in in the physical world in real time. We measure how busy places are, what people do, how fast cars go, and much more. We offer that data to developers, citizens, cities, and retailers, radically changing the way they interact with the physical world.<p>We built our platform around privacy. We never store any video and we do not identify people. We also make sure no one can reverse engineer our data to identify anyone. We are backed by top NYC &amp; Silicon Valley VCs, alumna of TechStars (Spring 2013), and actively plugged into their vibrant ecosystem of mentors and alumni.<p>We need creative and flexible minds, with a complete commitment to building nothing else but perfect software and systems. Make a real impact on your city, the NYC tech community, and a fast growing startup. Put your mark on this truly disruptive, slightly crazy, and ambitious platform we are building.<p>Placemeter is in a phase of rapid expansion, and we want you to join us.<p>APPLY NOW: <a href=\"https://jobs.lever.co/placemeter?lever-source=hacker-news\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;placemeter?lever-source=hacker-news</a>","time":1409673485,"type":"comment"}
