Come help us push trainloads of shipping containers.<p>At AMP we are dragging the supply chain management away from paper catalogs &#x2F; order forms linked by U.S. Mail &#x2F; fax to a modern tablet + SaaS architecture.<p>Our user engagement has gone up dramatically in the recent months so we&#x27;re doing something right. But there is still ton of new code to be written, and a huge impact to be made on the trajectory and velocity of our startup.<p>We&#x27;re looking for people with experience in frontend web development and hopefully some visual design background (or at least ability to take direction from our designer). So, HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JavaScript&#x2F;{React|MVC of your choice}. Our backend is ASP.NET MVC, it would be great if you could pitch in there as well.<p>Additional experience with Logistics, Ecommerce, Payments, Wholesaling, Retailing, is greately appreciated.<p>Contact jobs@amptab.com","time":1409584695,"type":"comment"}
