After retail (Amazon) and media (Google), finance is the last great intermediating industry, and the one best suited to being conquered by a tech company.<p>Here at Alphalend we&#x27;re doing just that. Things have been moving fast: founded in January, seed funded by May, operations up and running by June, we&#x27;re now in urgent need of the best and brightest programmers to turn our vision into reality. We&#x27;ve set up a fully-functioning lending platform and are working on a series of game-changing projects, for which we need talent.<p>Our first product: the world&#x27;s fastest P2P lending platform, powered by real-time automated credit decisions and risk pricing.<p>We&#x27;re running LAMP (Symfony2) + jQuery, but as we branch out, we&#x27;ll be looking to use the best technology for the task.<p>You&#x27;ll be joining a recently-funded, small team as developer #2 and employee #6, with plenty of opportunity to shape the direction of the company and culture.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, please drop us a line at contact@alphalend.com","time":1409578478,"type":"comment"}
