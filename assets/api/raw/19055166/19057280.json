The problem we made personal was the inefficiency (and lack of technological improvement) in the construction industry and we aim to solve it by introducing high tech, AI scheduling software to aid in planning and constructing real world projects. We think this is a great problem to solve because no other tech like ours exists. Where most other companies in this space focus on reporting, or task management, we tackle one of the hardest parts, the scheduling itself.<p>Our space lends us to have to solve many interesting problems from optimization, to modern ux flow, to graph theory, to fault tolerant services. We are currently seeded with a total of 3M funding and are striving to make our series A round. And we&#x27;d be happy to have more people on board before dilution :).<p>To apply, email me directly at arno@alicetechnologies.com with Hackernews in the title.","time":1549047637,"type":"comment"}
