We help build high-quality labeled datasets for both training and clinical validation, as well as tools for model deployment and execution. Some of our unique challenges include: operating in HIPAA-compliant environments, managing huge medical imaging&#x2F;text&#x2F;genomic datasets, distributed data processing and machine learning model training, and building complex web applications with UI&#x2F;UX appealing to both doctors and engineers alike.<p>We&#x27;re currently hiring front-end engineers (React&#x2F;Vue&#x2F;GraphQL) and full-stack&#x2F;devops engineers (Docker&#x2F;Kubernetes&#x2F;GCP&#x2F;AWS). Experience with machine learning (Tensorflow&#x2F;Keras) is definitely a plus. Experience in medicine or healthcare is preferred.<p>Please email us directly at jobs@md.ai.","time":1549042015,"type":"comment"}
