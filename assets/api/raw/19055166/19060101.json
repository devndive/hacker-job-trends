Our oven takes the stress out of cooking with hundreds of presets to automatically cook anything from Salmon with Broccolini and Tomatoes to Hot Pockets. It does this using directed energy from infrared lamps separating the oven into three distinct zones. This allows us to cook multiple foods differently, but at the same time, by controlling the power to each zone with software. Various sensors in the oven provide the algorithms with feedback.<p>The oven took over three years to develop and is on the market. Customers love it. We are now heavily investing in mobile and web products to complement our great product and fuel our growth.<p>Join our user experience focused software team and work with world class engineers, product managers, and designers. Current needs are in react-native, responsive web, and nodejs. Looking for flexible engineers that love to build great customer experiences.<p>We offer competitive benefits, equity, and free lunch. As a bonus the R&amp;D kitchen is steps away and they bring out amazing food all day long.<p>If you love food, it&#x27;s worth a chat. On site interviews get a high class lunch on us made in the Brava. :)<p>Contact: jd+hn@brava.com<p>Check us out on Instagram @bravahome<p>Note, we have more positions than are currently on this page:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.brava.com&#x2F;software-engineer-full-stack\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.brava.com&#x2F;software-engineer-full-stack</a>","time":1549067144,"type":"comment"}
