Aging is the single greatest risk factor for the most detrimental diseases — by understanding and treating the biological damage accumulated as we age, we can find powerful new therapies for fighting disease and living healthier, longer lives.<p>Over the past few decades, an unignorable amount of evidence has piled up from the best labs in the world showing that this is possible [1]. However, the research, while promising, has been frustratingly slow. We’re leveraging the power of machine learning to dramatically improve the experimental process and we believe this approach has the potential to unlock a whole new class of therapeutic discoveries.<p>We have deep support from top-notch investors, including General Catalyst, First Round, Laura Deming&#x27;s Longevity Fund, Felicis, Caffeinated Capital, Sam Altman, and more [2]. And our advisory board includes both world leaders in aging research and senior pharma execs.<p>We have a great early team of senior engineers (ex-Google, Khan Academy, CZI) collaborating tightly with leading scientists in the field. But we need help to continue scaling out our ML analysis platform and our automated lab. We’re looking for experienced software engineers and data scientists&#x2F;ML researchers who would enjoy working on things ranging from data infrastructure to modelling to statistical analysis of large datasets to building an internal web app for tracking lab data. Yes, you belong even if you don&#x27;t have a bio background — we&#x27;re a cross-functional team. (Although of course biology experience is a plus).<p>If this sounds interesting to you, head on over to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.springdisc.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.springdisc.com&#x2F;careers</a> or email me directly at benkomalo+hn@springdisc.com.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ldeming.com&#x2F;longevityfaq\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ldeming.com&#x2F;longevityfaq</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;spring-discovery&#x2F;with-18-million-in-new-funding-spring-is-speeding-up-our-engine-for-discovering-aging-therapies-c2ea6ff7d330\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;spring-discovery&#x2F;with-18-million-in-new-f...</a>","time":1549057078,"type":"comment"}
