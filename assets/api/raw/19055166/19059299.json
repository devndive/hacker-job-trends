That might sound simple, but Australians alone buy $120bn of groceries each year and our services provide an increasingly critical piece of the supply chain infrastructure that makes this possible. We operate in Australia and the United States and have a small engineering team with their home base in Melbourne.<p>We run a global real-time temperature monitoring system covering some of the largest supply chain partners in the world, where you will face daily challenges and demanding timelines that will be your problems to solve. But we’ll give you the autonomy to choose the right solutions, the flexibility to work in the way that suits you (working from home or abroad is possible, some of the time), and the support to handle everything a rapid-paced start-up environment can throw at you. Most of our front-end and back-end software is in JavaScript (or increasingly TypeScript), we’re moving from an Ember.js application to React, our firmware is in C&#x2F;C++, and our infrastructure is defined in code and orchestrated with Kubernetes. Other technology keywords we use include: MySQL, CouchDB, GraphQL, Redis, node.js, Azure, git, and Jira.<p>For a more thorough position description, or just to have a chat about the sorts of projects we have here, please contact me at: tom.allen@cooltrax.com. I&#x27;m the Engineering Manager here and I&#x27;m passionate about building a workplace culture that supports high performance engineering. We have our fair share of problems and legacy software to deal with, but there&#x27;s abundant opportunity for interesting greenfields work too, with a board ready and willing to invest in new areas of the business.","time":1549059496,"type":"comment"}
