Our underlying distributed key-value layer, TiKV, is a CNCF project.<p>We have a lot of interesting challenges to keep scaling for our existing users with 100+ TB of data and expanding to help users in new ways with their database needs.<p>I am part of the international team based out of San Mateo (bay area). Our small team is oriented to being remote, and we travel periodically to meet in person.<p>Our tech stack is Rust, Go, Kubernetes, and TiDB itself! You can work on a serverless cloud service, do low-level database hacking, or work directly with customers depending on your existing experience.<p>I like working on TiDB because I get to be a part of a big change going on in databases and work with a skilled team. On a daily basis I learn new things about databases and the cloud, but I also get to apply my existing experiences to have a big impact.<p>See the jobs link for more details and compensation.","time":1549100971,"type":"comment"}
