Quickly-growing companies can spend a significant fraction of their engineers&#x27; time interviewing; we help take the load off.<p>We are a well funded and quickly growing startup. Due to this quickly-growing demand, we&#x27;re looking to hire more Interviewer Engineers. The ideal candidate is a software engineer with strong written and verbal English skills with at least a few years of professional experience. Interviewing experience would be great, but we spend 20-25 hours (paid) training you before you even start, so if you&#x27;re strong technically and love working with people we can usually make it work. :) Interviews are conducted over video chat, using a collaborative code editor.<p>Freelance Interview Engineer - Remote - 7-40hrs per week <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced64c86\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced6...</a><p>Located in Seattle?
