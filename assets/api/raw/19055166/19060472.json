I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone in our Cape Town office would be remote from my perspective, I decided that the company needed to focus on hiring for remote. It&#x27;s been a good experience so far!<p>SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses.<p>We&#x27;ve been profitable for many years and have never had the need to raise capital. You&#x27;ll be building on a stable platform, with a strong team.<p>Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn&#x27;t mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don&#x27;t offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.<p>Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or polyglots who at least know Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they&#x27;ve learnt.<p>Location: GMT+2 to GMT+8. (Currently we have developers in South Africa, India, Lebanon and myself Singapore)<p>Salary: $30k - $60k<p>Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za and put &quot;Hacker News&quot; somewhere in the subject. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly. (P.S. I&#x27;m on holiday, so it will be at least a week before I reply)","time":1549072146,"type":"comment"}
