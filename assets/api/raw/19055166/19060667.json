Ideally we&#x27;re looking for mid- to senior-level engineers, but get in touch even if that doesn&#x27;t describe you: above all, we&#x27;re looking for great people, not &quot;X years in the job already&quot;.<p>Rokt is a successful startup (150+ employees, profitable for several years now) with a transaction marketing platform used by some of the world&#x27;s largest ecommerce sites. Our Sydney-based engineering team supports a business that is growing rapidly around the world. We have a small handful of applications and services in Clojure, including some of our most critical work.<p>If you have professional Clojure experience, great. What we&#x27;re really looking for, though, is developers comfortable with a simple, functional style of writing code -- we&#x27;ll happily bring you up to speed on Clojure if you&#x27;re not there already. If you have a Java background and you&#x27;re looking to move in a more FP direction, we&#x27;d love to talk to you. If you&#x27;re a Lisper or Haskeller, or have a background in another FP language, we&#x27;d love to talk to you.<p>Contact me at sam@rokt.com<p>Please note that unfortunately at this point we can only consider applicants who already have a legal right to work in Australia.","time":1549075227,"type":"comment"}
