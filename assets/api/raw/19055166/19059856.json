Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack (see below) and some keywords (blockchain, DLT, bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble&#x2F;grin, smart contracts, DAI, atomic swaps, etc).<p>Job positions:<p>- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don&#x27;t already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and&#x2F;or AzureDevOps is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)<p>- Xamarin developer: C# experience as a minimum, F# desirable (we can also mentor you on the transition from C# to F#), interested&#x2F;knowledgeable in Rust is another plus.<p>- Rust&#x2F;blockchain developer: experience in Rust, or smart contracts (especially EVM or Ivy) is a must. Desirable to have experience writing bindings or zkSNARKs.<p>Important perk for all positions: all the code&#x2F;scripts you&#x27;ll write will be opensource, at least for the first 6months.<p>Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com<p>PS: Abstain from applying if you have&#x2F;expect a managerial&#x2F;lead role. We need manpower, not decision makers. (That doesn&#x27;t mean you won&#x27;t make decisions, just that we won&#x27;t pay you to solely make decisions.)","time":1549064302,"type":"comment"}
