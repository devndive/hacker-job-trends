We want to breathe fresh air again! That&#x27;s why we need dead-cheap (or free) car sharing next to bike riding.<p>We build digital signage systems to make cars able to communicate with pedestrians and show ads where it makes sense. We provide additional revenue for car sharing companies and reduce their costs. So they can offer you cheap (or free) rides, when you need to use a car.<p>You want to work in a team which values social connections, ethics and work&#x2F;life balance more than start-up hipsterism. You love to code for ARM chips as well as build web apps with Angular. You write Java back-ends and knit a web of components into a fully working product. And maybe you want to get your hands dirty and learn tinkering with actual hardware, see how PCBs are designed and mechanical parts are assembled.<p>Our stack: Java 9, Angular, Elastic, Ansible, Ruby, Linux, Docker<p>Email: info@car2ad.de","time":1549095239,"type":"comment"}
