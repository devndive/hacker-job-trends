Our customers use our product daily (~10,000 calls&#x2F;day) and give us regular feedback. Because we’re self-funded, we avoid the hyper-growth of traditional VC startups, and we believe a few people can accomplish a great deal. We validate before we build, work on our own schedule, and execute on a focused vision.<p>This role is ideal if you like to work across the stack, routing calls through our event-based SIP softswitch, displaying real-time call information in our UI over WebSockets, or processing streaming audio for speech recognition. We use TypeScript&#x2F;Node.js, Ruby, React, and Postgres. We appreciate knowledge of these specific technologies, but it isn’t required.<p>What we’d love to see:<p><pre><code>  - Preferably 3+ years of full-time experience, but not required\n  - Experience that shows you’re comfortable with both back-end and front-end\n  - You like working closely with product and sales to drive customer success\n  - You’re not afraid to say “I don’t know,” but that doesn’t stop you from learning\n</code></pre>\nPlease reach out at eng@dialbot.co and feel free to include your resume, why you’re interested, and anything else that’s relevant.","time":1549047645,"type":"comment"}
