TileDB efficiently stores data generated from variety of domains (genomics, finance, imaging, geospatial, etc) in a novel unified format as sparse or dense multidimensional arrays.  Users can efficiently access this data via a growing number of language APIs and interfaces (C&#x2F;C++, Python, R and SQL data engines).<p>TileDB, Inc. has raised $4M in seed funding over the past 18 months. We are looking to aggressively expand our team. The new members of TileDB will help us build out a solution to enhance cloud interoperability, bring scalable computations to data stored in TileDB more easily, and improve areas such as data consistency, access control and sharing on the cloud through a managed service.<p>We are primarily seeking:<p>- Frontend engineers (UI &#x2F; UX with Vue.js)<p>- Backend engineers (Go &#x2F; K8S)<p>- Scientific R programmers<p>TileDB GitHub organization: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TileDB-Inc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TileDB-Inc</a><p>TileDB has been featured on HN: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15547749\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15547749</a>.<p>TileDB recent blog post: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2SjkeYR\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2SjkeYR</a><p>TileDB talk at PyData 2018: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2BfbyJ3\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2BfbyJ3</a><p>Our headquarters are located in Cambridge, MA.
