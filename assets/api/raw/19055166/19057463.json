Our tools process millions of patient records to predict what kinds of medical risk and problems will befall a patient and other medically relevant parameters. Join us to learn about the many intricacies of medical data, how to handle very large volumes of patient records, and how to build pipelines to operationalize cutting-edge machine learning models. We have developed a product major healthcare players want to buy and now need to turn it into something big that will streamline how healthcare works, come help us build it out!<p>Principal&#x2F;Software Engineer Data: We work mostly in Python and Scala. Main technologies include Spark, TensorFlow, Airflow and Hadoop among others. We’re always trying new things, and you will be part of making those decisions. We’re looking to build more robust pipelines to transform raw, often human-entered data into standards-compliant forms, and to deploy a wide variety of machine learning&#x2F;AI models in a scalable, traceable manner.<p>Senior Software Engineer Web: We are building out a web platform for clients to connect to our platform. This will be a clean-sheet ground-up build and we are looking for someone who can lead that project. Eventually we will hire more for this area, right now we’re looking for the first engineer to lay the groundwork and build initial prototypes.<p>We need several engineers at 2-3 year and at senior&#x2F;tech lead level. Requirements for more senior positions shift more toward demonstrated ability to architect and lead projects. In all cases though we look for independence, a strong sense of craft, and solid technical skills.<p>General Process (based on candidate we make small tweaks):<p>1.) Phone screen for resume<p>2.) Short take-home problem<p>3.) Phone conversation about take-home<p>4.) Onsite with us<p>Odds and ends: mostly onsite in lovely downtown San Mateo but flexible hours. Free lunch, ~25 employees, growing in a field that really affects people&#x27;s lives. Diverse work environment with good, friendly people.<p>Please apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lumiata.bamboohr.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lumiata.bamboohr.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a> and contact hr at lumiata.com with any questions.","time":1549048655,"type":"comment"}
