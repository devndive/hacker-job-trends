Unlike most healthcare startups, we are embedded within a hospital (two actually -- Mass General Hospital and Brigham &amp; Women&#x27;s Hospital) giving us access to the clinicians and data we need to solve the most important issues facing medicine today. And with support from Nvidia, GE, and Nuance, we have the hardware, translational expertise, and financial support to execute on our mission.<p>We&#x27;re expanding aggressively and are hiring across the org. In particular, the ML team will be scaling and is seeking skilled engineers with varying levels of ML experience, from junior roles for those with less time in industry to more senior positions for those who have a proven track record of shipping product. We offer competitive salaries, visa sponsorship, (unsurprisingly) great health benefits, and a mission that you can be proud to describe to friends and family.<p>If interested, feel free to reach out (contact info in profile). I&#x27;m Director of ML for the org and will personally respond to any questions you may have.","time":1549055340,"type":"comment"}
