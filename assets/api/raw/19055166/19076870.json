We bring technology, data and people together to enhance the human touch-points in the world of offline commerce - think IoT for physical stores. Our tools help brands realize their customer experience aspirations by turning customers’ smartphones into intelligent Bluetooth sensors that interact with the in-store point-of-sale infrastructure - informing staff of their customer’s presence on arrival, enabling hands free payments and generating opportunities for brand moments.<p>Our target market is the campus market and our mobile app is used to replace the student&#x27;s mealcard. Using the app you can place preorders, chat with the campus Food Director to provide feedback, check-in to the cashier POS via bluetooth (hands-free checkin) to enable mobile payments. You can also register payment types such as credit card (we work closely with various payment processors). Our mobile payment platform integrates with multiple POS&#x27;es.<p>We&#x27;re a Ruby + Java + Angular based company with a small group of developers looking to add additional developers to our core team and have a heavy influence on our company&#x27;s direction.<p>Our culture is great and you get that startup feel while working with experienced developers. We are looking for someone who is passionate about solving problems and loves to get their hands dirty (if you full-stack then it&#x27;s a major bonus). We are located near Adelaide and Spadina.<p>Apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lucova.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lucova.com&#x2F;careers</a> or send resume to martin at lucova dot com","time":1549292801,"type":"comment"}
