At no point have I felt like a diversity hire, but instead I know I am appreciated for my skill set. I can now say with pride that I look forward to coming into work and actively anticipate it, to work every day with these uniquely talented individuals on a multitude of projects. I don&#x27;t know if I have ever had such enthusiasm for my job.”<p>Check out bitmex.com&#x2F;careers for more details and please send a copy of your resume to people@bitmex.com if you are interested in learning more.
