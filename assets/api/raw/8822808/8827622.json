We need you. You have lived and worked in the US, preferrably in the Valley, and are plugged in.<p>The director of DSR cofounded a startup with a Ycombinator alumn, so it&#x27;s not like we have zero network in the Valley, but this requires far more effort than we can allocate right now with the current team. If you are reading this from SF, and thinking about moving to Berlin, this is a good opportunity.<p>There are about 10x more data science jobs in the US than in EU, so our goal for the next batches is to serve the US market.
