Reverse traceroute addresses this limitation, measuring Internet paths from arbitrary destination hosts toward a given source host.<p>The prototype and subsequent iterations of the system were sufficient for small-scale experiments but not terribly robust or scalable. The programmer will design a new implementation that is efficient, scalable and self-managing to ensure high availability. This system will also provide a public API that allows the community of researchers, operators and other practitioners to issue measurements and receive results.<p>This position is in a unique research environment, where the programmer will work on new and interesting problems and advance the state of the art. This is a full-time position with benefits and salary competitive with industry.
