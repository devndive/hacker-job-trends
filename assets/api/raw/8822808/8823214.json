(this is my team)<p>==================================<p>Engineer on the Climatology team<p>You will work with best-in-their-class climate scientists to implement and productionize their weather models.<p>Specifically you might work on several interesting projects including weather data reconstruction to provide more accurate predictions and readings to farmers who&#x27;s farms may be spread over several counties.<p><pre><code>   ===========================    \n   ====== Why I love it ======    \n   ===========================\n\n – I think Climate is poised to make a huge impact on farming. \n – I am surrounded by a group of super smart people that care about the work we are doing.\n – I get to tackle challenging problems everyday.\n</code></pre>\nI am on the satellite imagery team and I am really excited about the work we&#x27;ve been doing, I am happy to talk in length about it over email at skhalsa@climate.com.<p>If you are interested in the two positions above, please email me directly.
