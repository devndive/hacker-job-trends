Sunnyvale.\nApplication Security Consultant<p>Full-Time or Internship, work visa sponsorship available.<p>The start of a new year is a time many people become a bit introspective and reflect on their lives and careers.  Those of us who enjoy what we do, and find satisfaction in our work take account of our accomplishments and achievements in the past year.  Others may be less satisfied with their current position, and resolve to improve it.  If you find yourself in the latter camp, my advice is to find a job for which you are passionate, motivated, and talented.  Find your muse; something which engages your heart and mind, and gives you a sense a fulfillment.<p>For those of us at Matasano Security, this sense of pride and accomplishment comes from assessing the security of application software.  We find few things as inately satisfying as discovering ways to abuse application logic and bend it to our will.  Better yet is the satisfaction that comes with knowing our clients can now use our information to secure their applications and protect their clients. It takes meticulous attention to detail, and the ability to think outside the box and consider cases the application&#x27;s own developers didn&#x27;t.  Application Security can be both an intriguing mental puzzle, and an extreme adrenaline rush in a way few disciplines of computing are.<p>In the coming weeks, gyms will fill up with new members intent on exercising their bodies.  Me?  I&#x27;ll continue soldiering on, breaking and helping fix software, exercising my heart and mind.
