It is flexible, fast, and customizable for every use case.\nWe are looking for people who know graph theory, efficient algorithms, and have the desire to run fast on creating a scalable API.<p>While having a background in routing is a bonus,\nwe’re really looking for C++ coders with a deep understanding of algorithms\nand data structures. Knowledge in C++11, cache effiency as well as I&#x2F;O effiency are certainly a plus.<p>Primary focus would be extending an open source routing engine.","time":1420122165,"type":"comment"}
