Now we’re looking at interesting ways to use it to change driving. Cars of the future (and present) have onboard computers, tons of sensors, and internet connections over the cell network. If you could hook that up to our map data, you could do some really cool things.<p>To see what we’re up to, check out <a href=\"http://360.here.com/tag/connected-driving/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;360.here.com&#x2F;tag&#x2F;connected-driving&#x2F;</a><p>We’re looking for strong Java developers to make this happen. Experience with AWS, apache storm, stream processing or high volume, low-latency applications are all plusses.<p>We&#x27;re also looking for strong SDETs.<p>The things I’ve enjoyed most since starting here a few months ago:<p>- Interesting problem space<p>- Interesting tech stack<p>- I get to wear sandals to work (I chose to not take advantage of this particular perk today)<p>- Team running group that goes for a run together every Wednesday morning before lunch (weather permitting)<p>- Company gym<p>- Quickly-growing team<p>- Good medical insurance coverage<p>- Starting a lunch time study group (with lunch provided by the company!)<p>Interested? Questions? Email me at roman.zabicki@here.com I&#x27;d love to talk to you.","time":1420473311,"type":"comment"}
