Please note that this offer is mostly focused on \nFull Stack Engineers, but we are also looking to \nhire smart Data Scientists who have an interest in biodata and possibly \npeople who could help bridging BLE&#x2F;MSP firmware and driver development.<p><pre><code>    What we do\n    ==========\n</code></pre>\nOMsignal is an exciting Montreal start-up developing a revolutionary \nline of bio-sensing clothes that connect seamlessly \nto smartphones. The company is at the intersection of the wearable \ntechnology, well-being and fashion markets.<p>We are a well-funded startup [1] working to deliver a smart biometric \nshirt. You can read more about our mission on [2]. \nAnd for those who followed the US Open 2014, we are the technology \nbehind Ralph Laurent Polo Tech.<p>We just shipped the product to our first customers.<p><pre><code>    What we are looking for\n    =======================\n</code></pre>\nWe are looking for Full Stack Software Engineers who can \nhelp us to architect, design and implement a complex system based\non bleeding edge technologies (Scala, Akka, Spray, Reactive Programming [3], \niOS, Swift, Docker...), a modern architectural \nstyle (Micro Services, CQRS, Event Sourcing, Eventual Consistency), \nand a clean codebase (Clean Code, Domain Driven Design…) -- emphasis on \nthe “Engineer” over the “Full Stack” part.<p>In-depth knowledge of the technologies we use is not required, but \nhaving strong Software Engineering foundations is \n(Algorithmics, Design and Architectural Patterns,  …). \nUnderstanding that code is read much more often than it is\nwritten is an absolute must.<p>You should be willing to face the upcoming challenges \n(Machine Learning, Predictive algorithms, \nOpening the platform&#x2F;iOS SDK&#x2F;API, -- who knows the rest?…).<p>And of course, you need to speak&#x2F;write english fluently \n(we need to understand each other, right ?)<p><pre><code>     The Technologies we currently use\n     =================================\n\n - Backend : Scala, Akka, Akka Persistence, Spray, ReactiveMongo, SBT, Kafka, ZooKeeper\n - Web : NodeJS, AngularJS\n - iOS : Swift, Objective C, ReactiveCocoa, Core Bluetooth, CocoaPods`\n - DevOps : Ubuntu, Docker, Ruby, Amazon AWS&#x2F;EC2\n - Project management: git&#x2F;github\n </code></pre>\nThe `iOS` stack is more sophisticated than the average iOS App. \nIt includes a Pub&#x2F;Sub system similar \nto `Apache Kafka` (that we call iOS Kafka internally), \nmakes heavy use of \nasynchronous programming + `CQRS`&#x2F;`Event Sourcing` and \ncomputes biometric algorithms and reports.<p><pre><code>    Our culture\n    ===========\n</code></pre>\nWe get some inspiration from the Open Source model to \nachieve high-cohesion (within teams) and \nlow-coupling (between teams) : small, empowered teams, \nsystematic pull requests, developer autonomy.<p>Our software engineering practices are also influenced \nby Antifragile [4] principles\n(Small is Beautiful, Less is more, Hormesis principle, \nevolutionary darwinism, over-compensation ...)<p>And if you are on the Paleo diet, like hiking&#x2F;camping or \nenjoy a good raclette you will certainly find friends here!<p><pre><code>    Next step\n    =========\n</code></pre>\nIf you are curious about the project and want to explore \nopportunities working with us, you can \n - reach out to dev@omsignal.com\n - come hang out on IRC (irc.freenode.net #omsignal) to ask your questions<p>If you have a `github`&#x2F;`bitbucket` account, we would love to take\na look at what you like doing \n(even if you feel ashamed of it in retrospective -- explain us \nwhat you would improve now)<p><pre><code>    Footnotes\n    =========\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href=\"http://www.omsignal.com/blogs/omsignal-blog/14669049-omsignal-raises-10-million-series-a-round-from-bessemer-venture-partners\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.omsignal.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;omsignal-blog&#x2F;14669049-omsigna...</a>\n[2] <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2014/04/16/brave-new-wearable-world-crowdsourcing-health-and-the-coming-battle-of-bio-signals/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;venturebeat.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;04&#x2F;16&#x2F;brave-new-wearable-world-c...</a>\n[3] <a href=\"http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reactivemanifesto.org&#x2F;</a>\n[4] <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/0812979680/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416355343&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Antifragil\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incer...</a>","time":1420234938,"type":"comment"}
