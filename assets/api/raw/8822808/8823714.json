Users pull out their phone or laptop and start from scratch with an empty search box or a screen of apps. There is no context for the task at hand, and no history of the user&#x27;s preferences. It won&#x27;t be this way for long, your computer has an incredible volume of data about you stored in email and in calendar so a world where this rich context is put to use is inevitable. We are doing just this -- building rich user profiles and analyzing the tasks each user needs to accomplish in real time -- so that when a user pulls out their phone, they are proactively presented with personalized solutions.<p>We are moving from a world where computers are tools people engage, to a world where computers proactively engage users with targeted decisions -- simplifying and automating life&#x27;s daily tasks. This is a categorical shift in how we use computers and we have found early traction and growth via converting daily tasks into actions through large scale data processing of users email and calendar data.<p>Contact: wferrell AT weldai.com","time":1420137162,"type":"comment"}
