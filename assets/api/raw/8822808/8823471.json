Thousands of kids have already signed up to our service.<p>But we not only help young people buy Legos and save for bicycles - we are building an awesome technology team that eliminates legacy code, keeps the bug rate tiny, and stays small &amp; joyful. We are doing this by adopting techniques like pair programming, test-driven development, continuous deployment, and microservices. You can read more about our plan to be awesome on our tech blog <a href=\"http://tech.osper.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.osper.io</a>.\nWe want to meet and work with smart technical folks of all varieties - from server-side devs to sysadmins, mobile coders to testers, security analysts to data crunchers - but especially front-end experts who like mobile app development of any kind (we happen to use PhoneGap&#x2F;Cordova but don&#x27;t expect candidates to know this framework).<p>We are willing to arrange relocation to London for the right candidate. Sorry, we&#x27;re not ready to take on remote team members at this stage.","time":1420132403,"type":"comment"}
