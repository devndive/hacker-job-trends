We&#x27;ve also built out PTO tracking, some reporting&#x2F;analytics features and a B2B payments feature. We aren&#x27;t just about payroll.<p>We are a PEO, which means we coemploy our customers employees (similar to Trinet&#x2F;Ambrose or ADP Total Source, if you&#x27;ve ever heard of those). Because of that we&#x27;re able to do a lot of really cool things including offer health insurance at a massive discount, as well as bring many other benefits traditionally reserved for large companies to startups and SMBs. We&#x27;re growing very quickly (35-40% month over month) and just raised a $6mm series A from Thrive, Index, a few others[1].  Our founders are former Amazon, Etsy and Groupon executives who have had successful startups in the past.<p>We handle payments and lots of very sensitive information (bank numbers, social security numbers etc.) so we need people who are comfortable working in that environment. Basically we&#x27;re looking for senior level engineers to help build the foundation for a really awesome engineering org. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions (will@justworks.com).<p>No contractors, no remotes, sorry.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/10/09/justworks-rai..\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.wsj.com&#x2F;venturecapital&#x2F;2014&#x2F;10&#x2F;09&#x2F;justworks-rai...</a>.","time":1420135344,"type":"comment"}
