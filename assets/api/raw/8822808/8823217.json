You can find a better explanation here: <a href=\"https://launch.blendle.nl/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;launch.blendle.nl&#x2F;</a> and the actual product is here: <a href=\"https://blendle.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blendle.com</a>.<p>We use ruby, node, redis, elasticsearch, postgresql, ansible, sinatra, and more ruby. There&#x27;s also some PHP that we&#x27;d love to see ported to Ruby.<p>Unfortunately, all the jobs postings are in Dutch.
