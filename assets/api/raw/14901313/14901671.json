Millions of farmers globally don&#x27;t have access to the basic farm tools the rest of the world depends on for food production, good seed and fertilizer. We sell these proven agricultural tools on credit, and use satellite data and ML to figure out who we can lend to profitably.\nWe use Scala, Python&#x2F;NumPy&#x2F;SciPy (for science&#x2F;ML), android and are heavy postgres users. We&#x27;re building great software for places with low reliability networks and harsh environmental conditions.\nWe delivered fertilizer to ~1000 farmers earlier this March and are now in the process of getting paid back and supporting our farmers this season. Right now we&#x27;re building software tools to help us communicate with rural farmers who are often illiterate and frequently struggle even with pressing buttons on their phones.<p>To apply, send me an email at earl@apolloagriculture.com","time":1501601108,"type":"comment"}
