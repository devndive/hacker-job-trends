We&#x27;re rethinking every level of the stack, from isolation technology to zero-allocation networking to distributed datastructures. The applications of our technology range from financial market prediction and climate modelling to deep learning and synthetic biology.<p>What we need from you<p><pre><code>  • Autonomous - Able to construct a case study without supervision\n  • Adaptable - Able to learn new domains quickly, like genomics or the intricacies of linear algebra\n  • Algorithmic expertise - We are parallelising complex applications, and you will be deciding what data to send, and when.\n</code></pre>\nWhat we can offer you<p><pre><code>  • Interesting problems where you can apply the full range of your CS knowledge and skills \n    ◦ high-level software architecture\n    ◦ low-level debugging\n    ◦ theoretical understanding of computing\n  • Cool environment - We&#x27;re still very small\n  • Impact - Big clients, and every line of code matters\n  • Novel work - Solving problems that no one else has been able to\n</code></pre>\nIf this excites you and you match ≥4 of the following, we’d love to hear from you:<p><pre><code>  • Loves C, C++, and&#x2F;or Rust\n  • Has a wide array of ambitious, self-directed projects\n  • Able to work at various levels of stack, high to low-level\n  • Able to reason about the space, time, communication complexity, and requirements of different algorithms\n  • Enjoy implementing sophisticated algorithms\n  • Solved problems using distributed and&#x2F;or shared-memory parallelism\n  • Enjoy performance optimisation and low-level debugging\n</code></pre>\nDrop us an email and tell us how you match up at jobs@hadean.com","time":1501797341,"type":"comment"}
