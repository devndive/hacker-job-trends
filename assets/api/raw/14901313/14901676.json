It is working to rebuild itself into a digital-first company from its successful roots as a magazine company.<p>This transformation hasn&#x27;t been easy.  As with other print publishers, Time Out is dealing with declining revenues.  That&#x27;s resulted in the company reducing its headcount and laying off many folks.<p>The good news is that there is a new set of folks at the helm.  Many of them hail from successful web companies; many are from TripAdvisor.  I&#x27;m excited to see us go &quot;all in&quot; on becoming a digital company.<p>What make me optimistic about Time Out is that it has retained a stellar group of writers and editors who truly know the cities they write about.  Our writing ranks on Google because it is good, not because of SEO trickery. There&#x27;s also a core technical team which is excited to provide and tune how our users read our content.  The stuff that other companies have to fake – brand, identity, content, coolness – is what Time Out not only has, but actually personifies.<p>As we couple our writers with tech-savvy folks, I expect to see some stellar results.","time":1501601143,"type":"comment"}
