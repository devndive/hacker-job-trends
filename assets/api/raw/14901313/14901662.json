Our mission is to find a safe, loving, and stable family for every child.\nBinti&#x27;s software is used by private adoption agencies in 30 states. We&#x27;re in the midst of expanding into serving government foster care agencies and are close to reaching two-thirds of the foster care families in the state of California.\nWe have sustainable revenue, fanatical customers, and ample seed funding from top investors like First Round, Kapor, and Lowercase. We work together in SF and are growing rapidly.\nBinti&#x27;s main SaaS web product is a conventional monolithic Rails&#x2F;Postgres app that delivers value in heaps and heaps, and remains super fun to hack on. We&#x27;re building the monolith up higher and higher, and looking forward to soon chipping off a service or two (perhaps in Elixir?). We&#x27;re using Kubernetes&#x2F;Google Cloud.\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;binti.com&#x2F;binti-careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;binti.com&#x2F;binti-careers</a>","time":1501601089,"type":"comment"}
