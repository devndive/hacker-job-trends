We provide candidates with free, live, rigorous practice interviews and use data from these interviews to identify top performers, who can then talk to companies anonymously right on our platform. We’ve hired for Facebook, Uber, Twitch, Lyft, Yelp, and more.<p>You’d be the 1st full-time sales person on the team and our 7th overall hire, so in addition to the nice equity upside for being an early employee, there’s tremendous opportunity to make a big impact, not just on the company, but on the direction of the whole hiring industry. So, if you’ve ever wanted to take hiring from a Kafkaesque resume-ridden shit-storm into a rational, delightful process for competent humans, this is your chance!<p>Email nico@interviewing.io if interested.","time":1501603871,"type":"comment"}
