Whether someone needs a handyman, house cleaner, mover or delivery person, TaskRabbit delights clients by matching the right skilled person in minutes.

We have applications for clients to hire taskers, for taskers to register with the platform, and for our internal users to administer the service.

We&#x27;re ideally looking for a full stack engineer but would be thrilled to hire a competent front-end engineer who has aspirations to learn Rails someday.<p>Job Description: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;pl7qst1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;pl7qst1</a>","time":1501610561,"type":"comment"}
