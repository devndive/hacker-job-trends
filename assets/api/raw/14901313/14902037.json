Cells in our bodies use mRNA to turn the information stored in DNA into protein machines that carry out all aspects of our biology; when this process is broken, it can lead to diseases like cancer.  By introducing mRNA molecules into cells we can directly fix these problems, and enable a revolutionary new class of medicines.<p>We are looking for a motivated data scientist to join our Computational Sciences research team.  There are opportunities to make an impact across the company, from leveraging data generated by our automated production processes to cutting edge application of machine learning and neural networks on biological sequence data.  The ideal candidate would be as comfortable at a terminal as in an biology seminar- but exceptional candidate from all backgrounds will be considered.<p>Moderna Therapeutics is a clinical stage 6-year old company that has raised a collective $1.9B in private financing.  In the last year and a half, we have started 7 Phase I Clinical trials and have 5 more in the immediate pipeline, with many more to come.  Please, give the position a look!","time":1501602785,"type":"comment"}
