We started out over two years ago in the street food industry, and we&#x27;ve been showing steady growth as we&#x27;ve expanded into more hospitality-related industries like fixed-location restaurants, bars, cafes, etc. The challenge at the moment is scaling the matching of 200+ jobs per week with our pool of workers. We assess the skills of workers, they let us know every week when they&#x27;re available, and then we match jobs with workers as they come in using a custom ranking algorithm.<p>We want to build a mobile app for iOS and Android devices. This will allow us to streamline the process of engaging the individuals doing jobs on our platform (e.g., inviting them to jobs and confirming hours). You will be responsible for developing our Android and iOS app from scratch using the technologies you see fit. React Native seems like a good fit, but we&#x27;re open to alternative approaches.<p>As developer #2, you might be interested to know who you&#x27;d be working with. I graduated from Imperial College twelve years ago, worked for a company building group chat software (kind of like Slack), then worked for SwiftKey (mostly server-side things; before they were acquired by Microsoft). I spent some time travelling&#x2F;freelancing, and then joined HireHand when it was all being run out of a spreadsheet.<p>joe.freeman+hn@hirehand.co.uk","time":1501770072,"type":"comment"}
