We analyze and segment daily billions of requests in a YARN&#x2F;Hadoop cluster of more than 60 machines. In the next phase of development, we are planning to re-design more parts of our Big Data systems to make them work in real-time. This will involve the usage of some cutting-edge technologies and also the challenge to extend the on-premise cluster to the cloud.<p>We are therefore seeking a Senior Data Engineer who can design and implement new features of the Big Data DMP (new automated analyses, data aggregation or summarizing). As part of our interdisciplinary, international team you will work on Apache Spark to solve real Big Data problems and optimize our processes. Besides designing and building our new architecture you will convert new business requirements into data processes as well as help maintain our Big Data systems. You will be a mentor to our Data Engineer as well as another Data Engineer we are currently looking for.<p>We are around 30 people in the company, half of the team works on tech positions. 15 employees are male, the other 15 female. The ADEX is based in Berlin with a small customer support team based in Hamburg. We are pretty flexible and chilled, and very tech- and product-focused. We work in a cutting-edge industry, so we encourage our employees to try new technologies, go to meet-ups, workshops and conferences. We are not afraid of trying and failing because we strongly believe in learning from mistakes.<p>If you have any questions, please get in touch: elena@theadex.com","time":1502181925,"type":"comment"}
