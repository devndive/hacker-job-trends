We&#x27;re rethinking every level of the stack, from isolation technology to zero-allocation networking to distributed datastructures. The applications of our technology range from financial market prediction and climate modelling to deep learning and synthetic biology.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a brilliant systems-level implementor to join us in London who matches ≥6 of the following:<p><pre><code>  • loves C\n  • loves Rust\n  • has a wide array of ambitious self-directed projects\n  • has got their hands dirty writing technically complex systems, such as:\n    ◦ a high-performance database&#x2F;KV store\n    ◦ an OS\n    ◦ a programming language implementation\n  • enjoys writing roughly–performance-optimal code\n  • enjoys writing roughly–reliability-optimal code (static&#x2F;bounded memory allocation)\n  • has used EPOLLET\n  • has used io_submit + O_DIRECT\n  • has bypassed the Linux kernel (for fun and&#x2F;or profit)\n  • has written on top of paravirtualisation APIs\n  • enjoys reverse engineering\n  • [insert your own comparable points here]\n</code></pre>\nOur team runs the gamut — systems, distributed systems, compilers, scientific computing, professors, famous computer scientists — and is well-funded to change the landscape of compute.<p>If intrigued, drop us an email with how you match up to the above list to jobs@hadean.com","time":1501797345,"type":"comment"}
