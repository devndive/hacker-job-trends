Specifically, I&#x27;m hiring both frontend and backend engineers to build Coinbase.com and the APIs that power the Coinbase mobile apps. Come work on digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum every day!<p>About us:<p>* We use React, Mobx, Flow, webpack, and styled-components on the frontend.<p>* Our APIs are currently powered by Rails with a MongoDB backend, but we&#x27;re investing heavily in decomposing the monolith into services written in statically typed languages.<p>* We&#x27;re exploring GraphQL for future APIs and are hiring two people to lead our APIs team.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, email me at jpollak@coinbase.com. I&#x27;m also more than happy to answer questions on here (about Coinbase in general or the roles).<p>NOTE: A spammer posted this same post below, not sure why.","time":1501609899,"type":"comment"}
