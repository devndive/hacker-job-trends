We allow our users to send their customers emails that work like a normal web experience. Customers are submitting reviews, educating themselves with hotspots, and even shopping with 1-click directly in email. We believe that the inbox of the future is going to be just another surface for people to do what they want, like a bit sized application delivered in a push. We&#x27;re hiring smart engineers across the stack to help us make that a reality.<p>Stack:\nEmberJS\nNodeJS - API\nMongo, Influx,\nAWS, Docker","time":1501611092,"type":"comment"}
