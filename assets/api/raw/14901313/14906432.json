Help define the company and take ownership of your chosen field.<p>Registered in Hong Kong, we are a small, mainland China based, international team in the mid prototyping phase, approaching prep-for-manufacturing on a novel series of distributed food service locations supporting automated food preparation and retail. You can look at them as scaled down factories, robotic chefs or one large distributed just-in-time custom food manufacturing system including the associated logistics network. Fresh ingredients and personalized customer orders in, tasty cooked food out.<p>We are in perfect unison with the largest trends in the sector (convenience, personalization, mobile ordering, commodification of last mile delivery), are already oversubscribed for our next investment round and have recently doubled down by moving to Shenzhen. We have great experience with China, less in manufacturing, lots in complex systems and emerging technology, and multiple successful exits globally.<p>Mandarin speakers well regarded, but Chinese knowledge is not required. Clear written technical communication in English is mandatory. Skills and experience first, qualifications a distant second. We respect execution.<p>Email in profile, please include &#x27;Candidate: &lt;Desired Job Title&gt;&#x27; in subject. No recruiters.","time":1501629808,"type":"comment"}
