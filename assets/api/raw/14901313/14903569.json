We are offering retail as a service.  We rent slots in our store to brands who have one off products that they want to get into the hands of their customers.  We have flexible options about selling.<p>Our stack is C# ASP.NET Core backend with a React, Typescript, WebPack front end.  I want to throw Orleans in there eventually but right now we&#x27;re focused on our front end.<p>About you: We need someone who is a self starter and takes ownership of the tasks they are assigned.  If we ask you to design something we&#x27;ll give you feedback as you see fit but if you have an idea we want to hear it!  We don&#x27;t expect the tester to have technical knowledge but interest in automation would be a huge plus.  I&#x27;m sorry no developer positions right now.<p>Please email me elarge [at] apolloroboticstechnology [dot] com. (The company name is ApolloRoboticsTechnology, but we are Doing Business As TrueForm for our storefront)","time":1501610861,"type":"comment"}
