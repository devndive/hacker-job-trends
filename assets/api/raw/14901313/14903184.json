We are committed to open science and everything we do is open source. We currently develop in Scala, Spark, Python and C&#x2F;C++ but will use any tools we need to get the job done.<p>We&#x27;re looking for skilled engineers who have a solid CS&#x2F;engineering background, can quickly write clear, correct code and, for the senior position, have experience working on large, complex projects. You don&#x27;t need experience in biology or our particular technologies. We work in a highly multi-disciplinary environment (with biologists, bioinformaticians, doctors, operations and mathematicians). Self-improvement is a fundamental part of our culture; we want to grow great engineers. You must be excited to be challenged and learn new things.<p>Questions? Want to apply?
