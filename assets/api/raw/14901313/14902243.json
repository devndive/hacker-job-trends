Having raised $80M in our ICO, we&#x27;re now ready to scale our team and tackle bigger challenges.<p>We&#x27;re primarily looking for strong Rust developers, but are open to smart programmers willing to extend their skillset. We are strong believers in CI, testing, and safe and secure programming principles, as we&#x27;re doing business in a very rough and demanding environment.<p>The extent of what we&#x27;re building is very wide, so various backgrounds are welcome, as long as you do not\n mind writing solid backend code. Experience with credit card payment integrations is a definite plus for\n some of our projects.<p>No whiteboard or fizzbuzz interview, but don&#x27;t worry we&#x27;ll make you sure can code.<p>Reach me at klodio at the company&#x27;s domain if you want to know more!","time":1501603791,"type":"comment"}
