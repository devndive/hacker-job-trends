Our long-term goal is to provide the building blocks for developers to automate the offline world through APIs.<p>I&#x27;m the head of engineering at Lob. In between my last job and this one, I spoke to 42 organizations before I found what I was looking for in Lob: an exceptional team at the beginning of its growth phase, and also a company with a track record of being deliberate about its culture and which is intentionally building a good place to work.<p>We are a small and mighty engineering team with a ton of product and infrastructure problems to solve as we keep pace with rapid growth. So, we&#x27;re currently looking for experienced software engineers who can take ownership of entire projects. We hate contrived interviews, so our process rewards practical problem solving (based on real problems we&#x27;ve faced) and excellent communication.<p>Apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lob.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lob.com&#x2F;careers</a> if this intrigues you!","time":1501611720,"type":"comment"}
