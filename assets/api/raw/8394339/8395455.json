Our customers use a mobile app, our website, or SMS to schedule a delivery, and then we use sophisticated software and processes to &#x27;level up&#x27; what is still mostly a pen-and-paper industry. We&#x27;ve been growing exponentially for over a year now; if you live in SF and haven&#x27;t heard of us, you will soon!<p>Before considering joining our team, you might try out our service.  Send me an email and I&#x27;ll make sure you get a credit.<p>We&#x27;re hiring Software Developers of all experience levels to solve problems ranging from the capacitated vehicle routing problem to image processing to linux kiosks. We&#x27;re primarily Django + Bootstrap.js with a healthy dose of Celery + Heroku + Ubuntu. Big bonus points if you have history in the industry!<p>We&#x27;re also hiring a Customer Experience Specialist. No technical skills are necessary for this role, but you&#x27;ll need well-developed empathy and solid written and verbal communication skills. We have absolutely stellar customer satisfaction and retention statistics, and we aim to keep it that way! If you want to join a rapidly-growing startup in San Francisco, but aren&#x27;t an elite hacker, here&#x27;s your chance!<p>Finally, at our current growth rate, we&#x27;re hiring part-time drivers constantly.  If you have a car, a clean driving record, and want a part time job with evening hours, join us!  The job is great for students, or perhaps those who want a little extra cash while bootstrapping their startup.<p>If you have any questions about any of these roles, please do not hesitate to email me directly at sam &lt;at&gt; rinse.com","time":1412179119,"type":"comment"}
