Our mission is to make these tools as easy to use as possible, which dramatically broadens the availability of solar.  It&#x27;s a unique place in the solar industry, new technologies desperately need software like ours to convince both banks and installers that they can have positive impact on energy production.<p>We launched to revenue in January, and have real traction and high growth, and we&#x27;re still just a 4 person team, so there&#x27;s a ton of opportunity.   Everyday we get to deal with a range of problems that few startups get to offer – we have a modern web-stack, we need to use our cloud-clusters for the simulation half of the product, but also get to solve interesting physics&#x2F;optimization problems on a regular basis (if that&#x27;s your thing).<p>– Paul paul.gibbs@folsomlabs.com<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/better-faster-ba..\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.greentechmedia.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;read&#x2F;better-faster-ba...</a>.\n[2] AngularJS, Python&#x2F;Flask (API&#x2F;Backend), Cython&#x2F;C (Physics Simulation Engine)","time":1412174172,"type":"comment"}
