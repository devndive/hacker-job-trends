(Potential for Visa support, but we need people fast so would start by having them work remotely.)<p>We&#x27;re a small group (aiming to get not-for-profit status) that focuses on improving the usability of open-source secure-communications tools. We launched last month with support from Dropbox, Google, and the Open Technology Fund, and we&#x27;re now hiring for the following positions:<p>+ Research Director (or Associate Director) – ideally with a background in UX research, product&#x2F;project management, and security<p>+ Operations Manager – with a background in grants management, communications, and admin support<p>Our immediate efforts will include partnering directly with open-source toolmakers to help them improve the usability of their tools (by bringing in UX researchers and UX designers), and building a repository of online resources that toolmakers can use without working directly with us.<p>The team will be small, so folks hired into these roles will have a lot of responsibility and a lot of potential for impact and growth, both on the open-source secure-communications ecosystem and on the culture of the organization.<p><a href=\"https://simplysecure.org/hiring/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simplysecure.org&#x2F;hiring&#x2F;</a>","time":1412952438,"type":"comment"}
