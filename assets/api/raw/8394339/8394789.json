We build software that helps hosting companies compete against Amazon by providing a turn key Cloud and CDN platform. We are well funded and have big clients such as major cloud hosting companies (Dediserve, VPS.net etc.) and big telcos on our Cloud and CDN platforms.<p>We have more than 500 individual hosting providers running our software and we want to cluster them all to bring a compute federation so users can spin up a cloud server of any scale anywhere in the world. We&#x27;ve already done this for the CDN market: <a href=\"http://onapp.com/platform/onapp-cdn/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;onapp.com&#x2F;platform&#x2F;onapp-cdn&#x2F;</a><p>-------------------------------------<p>Our dev stack comprises of Rails, Git, Postgres, Redis and Ansible but there&#x27;s plenty of other technologies being used like Python, C++, Java, MySQL and more.<p>We are actively looking for Rails Developers for our London office to help us develop the OnApp Compute Marketplace.
