Thousands of kids have already signed up to our service.<p>But we not only help young people buy Legos and save for bicycles - we are building an awesome technology team that eliminates legacy code, keeps the bug rate tiny, and stays small and joyful. We are doing this by adopting techniques like pair programming, test-driven development, continuous deployment, and microservices. Read more about our plan to be awesome on our blog <a href=\"http://tech.osper.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.osper.io</a>.<p>We want to meet and work with geeks of all varieties - from sysadmins to server-side devs, testers to mobile coders, data crunchers to security analysts.<p>We are willing to arrange relocation to London for the right candidate. Sorry, we&#x27;re not ready to take on remote team members yet.","time":1412173633,"type":"comment"}
