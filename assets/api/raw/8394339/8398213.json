Most needed are experimentalists and programmers willing to take on the challenge of structuring &#x2F; automating data-taking and analysis for  the next generation of quantum computing research.  We code in Python.<p>There is also great need for an FPGA coder, for a homegrown technology platform that emphasizes low-latency for feedback experiments.<p>Experience with quantum optics, electromagnetic simulation, NV centers in diamond, MBE metals growth, or microwave engineering are all helpful.<p>Here are a few links to the job records:\n[FPGA and software]: <a href=\"https://www.ll.apply2jobs.com/ProfExt/index.cfm?fuseaction=mExternal.showJob&amp;RID=4426&amp;CurrentPage=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ll.apply2jobs.com&#x2F;ProfExt&#x2F;index.cfm?fuseaction=m...</a>\n[Others]\n<a href=\"https://www.ll.apply2jobs.com/ProfExt/index.cfm?fuseaction=mExternal.showJob&amp;RID=4435&amp;CurrentPage=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ll.apply2jobs.com&#x2F;ProfExt&#x2F;index.cfm?fuseaction=m...</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.ll.apply2jobs.com/ProfExt/index.cfm?fuseaction=mExternal.showJob&amp;RID=4433&amp;CurrentPage=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ll.apply2jobs.com&#x2F;ProfExt&#x2F;index.cfm?fuseaction=m...</a>","time":1412202614,"type":"comment"}
