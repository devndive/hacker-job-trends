The company is well-funded by some of the best enterprise angels and VCs in the business.<p>We&#x27;re building a mobile- and web-based app for anonymous feedback and communication within companies. Getting feedback in the workplace is hard. Suggestion boxes suck, 360 reviews suck, questionaires from HR suck. We can do better.<p>We&#x27;re looking for solid developers to work on all aspects of the app. Experience with node.js, Python, Objective-C, Java, client-side Javascript, Postgres and Linux would be directly relevant, bonus points for hackers with experience with &quot;mind-expanding&quot; technologies, like Lisp, Smalltalk, Erlang, Haskell etc.<p>We&#x27;re also looking for a security engineerâ€”someone who can audit the codebase, find and fix vulnerabilities and evaluate proposed features for their security impact. We&#x27;re taking anonymity seriously.<p>Finally, we&#x27;re looking for a technical marketer. This job is a combination of user reasearch and growth hacking. The ideal candidate is technical enough to dig into data but who is creative enough to test ad copy, write content, and comfortable talking on the phone with users to tease out insights.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, please contact me - colin@bettercompany.co","time":1412211810,"type":"comment"}
