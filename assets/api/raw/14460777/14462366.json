Our systems engineer job is not listed there so feel free to contact me directly for this or recruiting.asia@teralytics.ch. Salaries are extremely competitive and perks are good but we&#x27;re also extremely selective. For interns, the work and environment is very good: I&#x27;m ex-Microsoft, and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s better than the MS intern experience in those regards (we can&#x27;t match their intern salaries though).<p>We are an analytics company (ETH Zurich spinoff) that operates across a very large swath of the problem space: integrating deep into the &quot;sensors,&quot; through the processing and analytics, and then the visualization. We are solving some hard problems around realtime streaming, geospatial, and predictive analytics and work closely with customers to improve how data-driven cities and businesses work. The Singapore technical team is small (approximately 10) but growing in size and capabilities. Unfortunately, our work and opportunities are outpacing us, so come and help us!","time":1496337787,"type":"comment"}
