A very conservative market with old competitors and products = tons of potential. We are a remote team, which means we have no office and you can work from wherever you want. We&#x27;re all in on transparency, a great work culture and teamwork. Founders are 500 Startups alums and have previously worked on two startups, one of them out of Silicon Valley.\nWe&#x27;re looking for a full stack web developer to join our remote team. Ideally, you are a person who is not only proficient in frontend and backend work, but also have some experience in DevOps and system architecture. As you will be part of the early team, you should be a fast learner and be able to work in different roles.\nRead more here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;pento&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;242469-full-stack-web-developer-javascript-go-remote\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;pento&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;242469-full-stack-web-developer-...</a>\nOr contact me: emil at company url<p>Edit: layout","time":1496662377,"type":"comment"}
