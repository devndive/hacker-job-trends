Plaid&#x27;s goal is to enable this shift by building the tools and infrastructure that allow developers to create the next generation of financial services applications. Today, hundreds of companies such as Robinhood, Acorns, Coinbase and Venmo rely on Plaid to integrate with banks and the financial system.<p>Plaidâ€™s infrastructure handles millions of requests per day and thousands of bank integrations, and we pride ourselves on maintaining a robust API to support the developers who depend on us -- and the millions of consumers who use their apps. Our API and most of our services are written in Go and Typescript. Our infrastructure is built on top of AWS, Elasticsearch, Redshift, S3, Spark -- and although we love trying new technology as individuals, as a team we are pragmatic in our choices, favoring the right tool and not the flavor of the month.<p>We&#x27;re Series B and our current team is about 85 (including 35 in engineering).<p>If you are interested in any of our roles please reach out to me over email - jgreze __at__ plaid.com\nHere is a link to our job postings: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plaid.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plaid.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a><p>We&#x27;re especially focused on hiring experienced engineers (backend, product, security) at this time.","time":1496330572,"type":"comment"}
