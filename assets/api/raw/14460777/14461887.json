We&#x27;ve gotten significant traction with top brands like Nike, AirBnB, Weiden + Kennedy, Target, Levis, and many more. We&#x27;ve recently closed our B round and are gearing up for major growth.<p>We believe the best products are built when design and engineering work in concert, and are looking to hire the best to support that vision. We have tons of openings including:<p>- Front End Engineer (React, Javascript)<p>- Back End Engineer (Elixir, Javascript, Ruby)<p>- SDET (NightmareJS, Jenkins, anything needed to get it done)<p>Plus, we offer relocation assistance for candidates who are looking to move to Portland (who wouldnt want to live in Portland ^_^)<p>If you&#x27;re interested, ping at bnguyen [at] workwithopal.com","time":1496335354,"type":"comment"}
