We make quality software for the property management industry that helps save them time and get more leases.<p>We are at the stage where it makes sense to bring on a full-time QA Engineer.  You would be responsible for building out the QA side of things and would have complete ownership of the role as we grow.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rooof.com&#x2F;qa-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rooof.com&#x2F;qa-engineer</a><p>If you have any questions, reach out to me at matthew.mccormick@rooof.com.
