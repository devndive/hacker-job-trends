Our public site is powered by Django and the Django-REST-framework - we also use Pandas, Numpy and Jupyter for analysis and forecasting, and Celery for background tasks.<p>We use AWS heavily, employing most of the &quot;Hashistack&quot; (eg Packer, Consul, Terraform, Atlas) as part of a continuous deployment pipeline. See, for example, <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.octopus.energy&#x2F;2016&#x2F;05&#x2F;05&#x2F;django-elb-health-checks.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.octopus.energy&#x2F;2016&#x2F;05&#x2F;05&#x2F;django-elb-health-chec...</a><p>Client-side, we use React and SASS; our mobile apps are built using React Native.<p>Engineering standards are high. All code is well tested and thoroughly reviewed.<p>This is a great opportunity for several reasons:<p>* We have lots of difficult <i>design</i> challenges to solve. The UK energy market is complicated, dated and process-heavy - there&#x27;s an awful lot of domain modelling that we need to get right.<p>* We have difficult <i>technical</i> problems to solve. With the advent of smart meters, we&#x27;ll soon be processing millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption.<p>* There&#x27;s a great opportunity for disruption in the UK energy market. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not exactly popular. The energy landscape is changing as we move to more dis-aggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology.<p>* You&#x27;ll be working for a company that’s fighting climate change. We’re the largest investor in solar generation in the UK, and are funding wind and anaerobic digestion. We&#x27;re helping people to use greener technology and renewable energy, all helping move the UK towards a lower carbon future<p>We’re looking for someone who thrives on providing alternative opinions, challenging those around them and being challenged, and owning a problem and working on their own initiative.<p>Drop us a message at talent@octopus.energy","time":1496392428,"type":"comment"}
