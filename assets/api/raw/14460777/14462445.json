We are hiring young teachers from top 100 US colleges who are (1) AMAZING with kids, (2) engineers (don&#x27;t need to be a software engineer though), and (3) available to teach 10 hours per week. Each class is scheduled, 40 minutes long, and requires a stable Internet connection.<p>Our curriculum combines Puzzle, a Scratch-like language, with a 3D block world similar to Minecraft. While in alpha, we use Code.org and Scratch too.<p>*Pay is $30 per hour, and some equity, even though you won&#x27;t be a full-time employee.<p>Here&#x27;s a video: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ApjTV1iseHE&amp;t=5s\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ApjTV1iseHE&amp;t=5s</a><p>Technologies: You must be extremely comfortable teaching&#x2F;using Scratch mainly. Certain advanced students will require you to know JavaScript too.<p>Contact: tony[AT@]block[dot]school<p>Website: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;block.school\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;block.school</a>","time":1496338325,"type":"comment"}
