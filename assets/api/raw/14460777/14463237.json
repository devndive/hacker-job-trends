We are vertically integrated with our own supply chain, fulfillment &amp; delivery, and customized e-commerce platform optimized for a great customer experience. As you can imagine, technology plays an important part at every step of that process. We&#x27;re looking for more engineers&#x2F;developers to help build out features for our internal usage and for our customers&#x27; delight. You&#x27;d have a lot of say and room to experiment. Our API is primarily in NodeJS. Our front-end is a React&#x2F;Redux application. We absolutely love PostgreSQL with PostGIS and Redis. Lambdas are becoming a new favorite for services. A full stack developer would be ideal but if you&#x27;re more comfortable with the backend then that&#x27;s totally okay (i.e. if you&#x27;re focused on front end dev, this position isn&#x27;t going to be interesting for you. But reach out to me in the fall).<p>We&#x27;ll pay for relocation if you aren&#x27;t in the DC area.<p>4+ years of experience<p>- Backend languages: NodeJS&#x2F;Python&#x2F;Ruby&#x2F;&lt;insert language here&gt;<p>- Datastores: PostgreSQL (or SQL in-general), Redis, etc<p>- Building APIs (internal&#x2F;external)<p>- General understanding of DevOps<p>(Awesome to have) 1+ years<p>- Front end JS (React&#x2F;Backbone&#x2F;Angular&#x2F;etc)<p>- HTML&#x2F;CSS knowledge<p>Email me with your resume and blurb about a project you love(d) working on and why.
