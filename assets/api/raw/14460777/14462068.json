We believe that good performance management is critical for companies and employees to be successful. Unfortunately, the process is often painful, but we don&#x27;t think it has to be that way.<p>We&#x27;re growing really fast, based in San Francisco, and backed by some of the best investors including Thrive Capital, YC, Khosla, Marc Benioff, and Alexis Ohanian. The company was founded by myself (Eric Koslow) and our CEO Jack Altman. The engineering team only has four full time employees, so there&#x27;s a tremendous opportunity to grow your career and have a big impact on a growing startup.<p>We use React on the frontend, NodeJS on the backend, and communicate over a GraphQL API. If you enjoying working with cutting edge technologies this is the place. We&#x27;re looking for individuals that are product minded and enjoying owning problems from ideation to deployment.
