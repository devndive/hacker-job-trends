Through our push-to-talk wearable and voice platform, we deliver a heads-up and eyes-free experience that enables people to communicate more efficiently without losing focus, and to do their best work.<p>Our users depend on companion apps for connecting wearable hardware to the Internet, creating and switching groups, managing contacts, finding the location of their teammates, and more.<p>We&#x27;re looking for teammates who enjoy building, refactoring, and testing mobile software, and take pride in their work. You should care passionately about intuitive user interface design.<p>Java should be your bread and butter, and Android Studio your playground. We use Dagger to provide dependency injection, and RxJava to support reactive programming patterns. Our mobile applications use Bluetooth LE (GATT protocol) to talk to our wearable product, and RESTful APIs to talk to our service backend. We aim to iterate quickly, delivering app updates to our users every couple of weeks or so.<p>Orion is dedicated to building a diverse and inclusive team with a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. This means not only striving to hire a diverse set of humans, but providing them with support, mentorship, and opportunities to grow. We firmly believe that hiring and supporting a diverse team is valuable endeavor in itself, but also allows us to do our best work and make better products.<p>30min phone screen --&gt; take home exercise --&gt; 3.5hr on-site<p>Apply here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;vhar011\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;vhar011</a>","time":1497050316,"type":"comment"}
