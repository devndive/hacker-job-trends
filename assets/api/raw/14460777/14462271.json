Citizenship is a job requirement.<p>We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff like valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly. We write our own low-level tools, frequently in C99 to run on Linux. We also use IDA Pro, qemu, Simics, JTAG debuggers, gdb, Coverity, KlocWork, LLVM, and so on. Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers. We work with more than a dozen architectures including PowerPC&#x2F;ppc&#x2F;POWER, MIPS, ARMv8&#x2F;Thumb2&#x2F;AArch64, x86-64&#x2F;x64&#x2F;Intel, DSPs, and microcontrollers. We hire from no-degree to PhD. Common degrees include Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics.<p>We don&#x27;t normally work overtime, and we get paid more if we do. We&#x27;re never expected to take work home or be on call. Because of the citizenship requirement, there is no chance that the work will be outsourced. Flex-time is fairly extreme; some do randomish hours.<p>Location hint: Pick Arlington for a car-free life. Pick Florida or Texas to live in a place with no state income tax. Pick Florida for almost no traffic or commute, surfing, and houses that commonly go for $100,000 to $400,000.<p>You can email me at users.sf.net, with account name albert.","time":1496337313,"type":"comment"}
