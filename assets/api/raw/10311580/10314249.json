We pride ourselves on being the whole package - from transistor, to 3D print, to server, to web interface. We work on projects both with multinationals and startups as the virtual technology team, helping to drive the specification, prototyping and implementation of the client’s product.<p>We can promise you that no two projects will be the same and that you’ll get to work with a wide variety of amazing companies.<p>We maintain a technology blog here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zoetrope.io&#x2F;tech-blog\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zoetrope.io&#x2F;tech-blog</a>. We’d love to know what you think.<p>We’re looking for a multi-talented software engineer to join our Bristol team.\nAn ideal candidate will be at home with developing API’s, backends and occasionally even some front end work.<p>Given the size of the team (currently 3.5), it’s essential that we find an all rounder who will be happy to muck in and help complete the project.<p>Interested?
