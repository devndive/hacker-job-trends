We’re following in the footsteps of great companies like Gusto (formerly ZenPayroll) and Zenefits in making essential HR administration a snap for businesses large and small, and like Wealthfront, in making sound investing strategy accessible to everyone.<p>We also just closed a substantial seed round from top investors, but we’re currently just three people. If you’ve been wanting to dive into an early stage startup, this is the perfect time to start talking to us.<p>If you’re interested in working with us, you can expect:<p>* A prompt response with your next steps in the interviewing process.<p>* A challenging in-person technical interview based around collaborative pair programming. No whiteboard coding.<p>* An offer with market salary and above-market equity compensation.<p>* A friendly work environment that emphasizes clear communication and respect.<p>Ideally, we’re looking for someone with experience building and scaling web services in the wild. If you’re familiar with node.js, PostgreSQL, or React, that’s a slight plus. We don’t care where (or if) you went to school.<p>Definitely talk if us if you’re interested in user psychology and building tools that encourage good saving habits. That’s a big part of what we’re going to be thinking about going forward.<p>We encourage you to include pointers to open source contributions, your GitHub profile, and personal portfolios in addition to the usual resume and LinkedIn.<p>Reach out to careers@captain401.com (or apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;captain401.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;captain401.com&#x2F;careers</a>)","time":1443711708,"type":"comment"}
