Our current clients (credit card processing companies) are all international. Depending on the position, you may need to travel for on-site deployments and technical discovery meetings. We are internally funded and are working with MasterCard, who holds the IP.<p>Our stack is a lot of Node.js (dealing with a mix of binary and JSON data) and PHP (user-facing code). We are in the process of breaking the PHP monolith into smaller Node.js services. On the app-side, we are hiring Android and iOS developers.<p>Each client will be need to support millions of users. If you are good with scaling multiple small services in tricky deployment environments, we want to hear from you.<p>We are a tiny company – a tech team of six – taking on a lot of work from our well-connected business team. If you can be agile and build stability in the storm, we want to hear from you.<p>Our board would prefer to find people located in the Atlanta, GA area, or those who are willing to move. However, I personally work from Maryland, and our systems guy is in North Carolina. But if you&#x27;re a good fit, our CIO has the go-ahead to hire remote workers.<p>Interested? Send me a resume and tell me what you&#x27;re best at, and what you&#x27;re working on now. If you have a good joke, that&#x27;s fine, too.
