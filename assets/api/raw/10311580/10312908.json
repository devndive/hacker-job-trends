Gradescope lets instructors give out the same paper-based assignments they&#x27;ve always used, but then grade them online, while keeping track of the exact mistakes made by every student on every question. This enables unprecedented data analytics: we can reveal which concepts a student needs help with, or which questions are too difficult. To top it off, instructors finish grading in half the time.<p>Our product has been used to grade over 3.5 million pages of work belonging to over 30,000 students. We’ve raised a seed round, and are making our first full-time engineering hire to join the founding team of two PhDs and a professor from Berkeley CS. Over the next few months, we’re looking to expand our user base and roll out advanced features including autograding, additional analytics, and more. We offer market-rate salary with generous equity.<p>We’re currently looking for a full-stack engineer. We&#x27;ve got a Rails backend with some React on the frontend.<p>If you’re interested, please email jobs@gradescope.com","time":1443720837,"type":"comment"}
