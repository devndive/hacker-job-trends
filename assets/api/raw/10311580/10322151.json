Our company&#x27;s mission is to connect businesses with their customers.  My team specifically works on problems like sentiment analysis, topic classification, outlier detection, etc to derive insights from feedback including comments from hotel review sites, transcribed tech support calls, suggestion boxes left at your favorite restaurant, etc.<p>We&#x27;ve built an 85%+ accurate sentiment classifier which works in six languages, open sourced a Java port of Word2Vec, optimized a language detector for our data, and are currently working on a semi-supervised topic clustering algorithm.  In addition to the research component, our team also handles scalability and real-time distributed processing, processing millions of comments per hour.<p>If interested, please contact Andrew Ko at wko@medallia.com","time":1443833422,"type":"comment"}
