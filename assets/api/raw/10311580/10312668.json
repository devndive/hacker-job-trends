Bend&#x27;s on the small side, but big enough to not be boring.  It has a ton of outdoor stuff, and a climate that&#x27;s pretty good too.  It&#x27;s a great place for families, with good schools, and a relaxed atmosphere.  The company is large enough that it&#x27;s possible to go home every evening and spend time with your family or friends or outdoors.","time":1443719201,"type":"comment"}
