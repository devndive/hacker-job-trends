Our small team of biology and math Ph.D.’s has the potential to save lives and  be at the forefront of the revolution in image-based biological analysis.<p>What we do<p>There are more than 5,000 untreated rare genetic diseases, which together affect nearly ten million people in the US alone. Each of these diseases affects too few people for traditional pharmaceutical companies to approach them, so we&#x27;re building a way to seek treatments for hundreds of these diseases in parallel. We aim to find treatments for 100 of them in the next 10 years.<p>What you&#x27;ll do<p>The high-level job description has only one item: do whatever is necessary to help us progress in identifying cures for diseases. We hire the best, and trust that they are usually in the best position to decide what to try next. See the post linked below for more details.<p>Logistics<p>We&#x27;re based in Research Park at the edge of the mountains overlooking Salt Lake City, Utah. Gorgeous hiking&#x2F;running&#x2F;biking is literally out our back door, and it&#x27;s half an hour to 5 top ski resorts. We offer competitive pay, health insurance, relocation assistance (working at the office is part of the deal), equity, an awesome team to work with, and the chance to impact the world in a massively positive way.<p>Apply<p>Data science post: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recursionpharma.com&#x2F;senior-python-data-scientist.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recursionpharma.com&#x2F;senior-python-data-scientist....</a>\nData science applications: datasci@recursionpharma.com goes to Blake, cofounder&#x2F;CTO.
