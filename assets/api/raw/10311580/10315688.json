We&#x27;re a collection of electrical, mechanical, aerospace, software, science, etc. folks looking to image the whole planet on a daily basis with a large number of small satellites. It&#x27;s a terrific bunch of folks doing what we call &quot;agile aerospace&quot;.\nI&#x27;ve personally been with the company for over a year, working on &quot;Mission Control&quot;, an internal web app for managing the satellites and make life easier on our &quot;Spaceship Captains&quot; -- the operators who manage them. This is definitely one of the most interesting and fun roles I&#x27;ve had in my career (and I&#x27;ve had a few).<p>Python (Flask, Django) and Javascript (React, Backbone) are used heavily in the web projects. We of course have systems programming to do for the onboard software. Plenty of other interesting work from the satellite design and various subsystems, manufacturing, georectification of images, image corrections, dev ops, site reliability engineers, and heaps of possibilities with a supremely interesting dataset that we&#x27;re growing.<p>Full list of jobs at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.planet.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;#openings\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.planet.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;#openings</a>","time":1443743948,"type":"comment"}
