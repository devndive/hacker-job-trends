We are expanding the team to build the next version of our true multi-tenant platform with a few thousand events happening per second.<p>Data Scientists: We wish to push to edge of what is possible, and advance the field of routing problems itself. If Travelling thief, Knapsack, Capacity planning and other optimisation problem excite you, we are looking for you. We are team of PhD scientists and engineers with background in stats, working on building faster &amp; more scalable implementation of NP-hard problems, or even a combination of a few NP-Hard problems.<p>While we have pizza, beer, whisky, drones, oculus rifts, raspberry PIs on the house, the biggest perk we provide you is a remarkable team. We would love to spend our most productive years, around people with great intellect and unbridled enthusiasm.
