IoT, embedded systems, big data, you name it! We also have some opportunities in iOS and Android if you&#x27;re interested in working on those too. (That is, you must have Go experience, we are not looking for iOS-only or Android-only devs).<p>I don&#x27;t care about your experience or resume, I only care if you can code, communicate, and work well with others.<p>If you want to work on Go and live in a low cost of living area, we can even talk about relocation. But remote is great too (we actually don&#x27;t even have an office).<p>Email <i>jobs at stridatum.com</i> with a code sample for more info.","time":1443718140,"type":"comment"}
