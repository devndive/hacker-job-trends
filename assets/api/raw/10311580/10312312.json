Basically, we&#x27;re trying to do forms on the web more human and more like a human conversation. A picture says more than a thousand words and a website even more! So check out <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;typeform.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;typeform.com</a> for our standard project and also <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;typeform.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;typeform.io</a> for our API project, where we are also hiring!<p>We just got a series A funding, one of the largest in Europe! So if you&#x27;re excited about making the web a better place (duh) and want to do so in a sunny country with a lovely team, don&#x27;t hesitate to contact me at victor@typeform.com or go to <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;typeform.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;typeform.com&#x2F;jobs</a> to apply directly.<p>Hope to speak with some smart HNers soon :)","time":1443716663,"type":"comment"}
