We have a few open positions in the SW team:<p>- I manage the development of two products here -- PowerCASE (simultion preprocessor) and PowerACOUSTICS (numerical analysis post-processing tool), both both of which are C++ desktop applications developed Qt on Windows and Linux. We&#x27;re looking to grow both of these teams to support some major new enhancements that are planned. Both roles are listed as &quot;senior&quot;, but I&#x27;m flexible on the level of seniority.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;exa.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;senior-software-engineer-cae-post-processing-c-qt\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;exa.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;senior-software-engineer-cae-post-pro...</a><p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;exa.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;senior-software-engineer-cae-pre-processing-c-qt\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;exa.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;senior-software-engineer-cae-pre-proc...</a><p>- The team which develops PowerINSIGHT is also looking to add a couple of developers. PowerINSIGHT is a multi-platform desktop application (developed using C++, Qt, and some Python), which is used by engineers to help explore, compare, organize, and share the vast amounts of data generated by a series of fluid flow simulations.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;exa.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;principal-senior-software-engineer-c-application-development\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;exa.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;principal-senior-software-engineer-c-...</a><p>- Finally, we have a team which is developing a product that provides web-based access to Exa&#x27;s suite of engineering products (using Java&#x2F;J2EE and various other web technologies), with a particular focus on managing simulation&#x2F;analysis projects at a high level and supporting collaboration of multiple engineers working on the same projects.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;exa.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;principal-software-engineer-architect-exacloud\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;exa.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;principal-software-engineer-architect...</a><p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;exa.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;senior-software-engineer-exacloud-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;exa.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;senior-software-engineer-exacloud-0</a>","time":1443711871,"type":"comment"}
