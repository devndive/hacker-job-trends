Headquartered in downtown Ann Arbor, this post is about the developer positions listed in the Resumator link above.<p>We are a .NET shop through and through, with applications built using ASP.NET MVC (for our SaaS offering) or WPF (for our high performance ETL tool or our flagship Supply Chain Design offering).  The exception to .NET is our Simulation engine, which is C++.<p>A candidate applying for a role on the SaaS product, SupplyChainGuru.com, should be<p>* Strong with jQuery, JavaScript design patterns<p>* Familiar with ASP.NET MVC (understand routing, lifecycle management, authentication, authorization)<p>* Strong OO&#x2F;AO skills and familiar with typical .NET tooling (Unity, Entity Framework, NuGet, Dapper, consuming WCF)<p>A candidate applying for a role on the desktop product should be similar, forsaking jQuery and ASP.NET MVC for WPF.<p>A candidate applying for work with our Simulation engine should understand the simulation domain quite well with tremendous skill in working with brownfield projects.<p>Overall people tend to thrive best in LLamasoft when they are happy to be autonomous and self-motivated; management in development takes a hands off approach.  Teams generally work in whichever SCRUM fashion fits that group best.<p>Questions to careers@llamasoft.com.","time":1443716894,"type":"comment"}
