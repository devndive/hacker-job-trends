This enables unprecedented data analytics: for example, we can reveal which concepts a student needs help with, or which questions are too difficult. To top it off, instructors finish grading in half the time.<p>Our product has been used to grade over 3.5 million pages of work belonging to over 30,000 students. We’ve raised a seed round, and are making our first full-time engineering hire to join the founding team of two PhDs and professor from Berkeley CS. Over the next few months, we’re looking to expand our user base and roll out advanced features including autograding, analytics, and more. We offer market-rate salary with generous equity.<p>We’re currently looking for a full-stack engineer. We&#x27;ve got a Rails backend with some React on the frontend.<p>If you’re interested, please email jobs@gradescope.com","time":1438627517,"type":"comment"}
