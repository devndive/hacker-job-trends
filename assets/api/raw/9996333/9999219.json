Shoot over an email to careers@swarmnyc.com<p>About Us:<p>We&#x27;re actually a bunch of kids who never wanted to give up playing, so we decided to work in such a way that we could get away with playing all day. On the surface, we make apps for iPhone, Android, Apple TV, wearables and emerging technology, behind the scenes though -  we draw, doodle, and solve puzzles. Usually, those puzzles are in code, product, or design. I guess we&#x27;re also a bunch of individuals who are passionate about technology.<p>Truth be told, weâ€™re not just a services company. We experiment and hack a lot. Sometimes those experiments fail (like an anonymous twitter chat app) and sometimes they get excellent traction and recognition.<p>We&#x27;re also pretty big on education, we don&#x27;t expect any new team member to know everything. We&#x27;ll train you in our process, how to build apps for mobile and web, why certain design structures work and why others don&#x27;t, and we&#x27;ll mentor you as you grow in your skill-set.<p>Our 10 person team is in a coworking space with plenty of comfy collaborative areas, and is beautifully situated in the Flatiron district.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;swarmnyc.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;swarmnyc.com</a>","time":1438630822,"type":"comment"}
