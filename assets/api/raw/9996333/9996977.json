It goes into a combination of MySQL, HBase and ElasticSearch for processing by various batch and realtime services. We use it to create interactive web experiences using AngularJS, and to generate millions of email and PDF (yes, PDF) reports to be sent to eager utility customers. This happens on top of micro-service and batch processing frameworks we&#x27;ve built in-house to handle our specific use cases.<p>We use queuing systems like RabbitMQ and Kafka to coordinate all this work in progress. We automate all our testing on top of our Jenkins infrastructure, and we&#x27;re gradually introducing Docker into the mix for even better end-to-end automated testing.<p>Go to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.greenhouse.io&#x2F;plans&#x2F;64451&#x2F;jobapp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.greenhouse.io&#x2F;plans&#x2F;64451&#x2F;jobapp</a> for more info.","time":1438617349,"type":"comment"}
