Specifically, in the short-term, we&#x27;re looking to build out more powerful search and discovery features on our platform. You&#x27;d be working with 1 other junior Rails dev, 1 other senior Rails dev, and 1 senior Angular dev.<p>We&#x27;re a super early startup with seed funding. It&#x27;s an amazing time to join, as you&#x27;ll have a lot of autonomy, and you&#x27;ll have a good amount of control over the direction of the product. Every week is a completely different experience.<p>If any of this sounds interesting, contact me at ken {at} liquidtalent {dot} com<p>And feel free to check out what we have now: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;liquidtalent.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;liquidtalent.com</a>","time":1438616314,"type":"comment"}
