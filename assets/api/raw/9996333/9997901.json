We have a team of 6 engineers (frontend &amp; backend) and create cutting edge stuff for high-profile clients in the food&#x2F;beverage industry.<p>Stack: io.js (node.js), tons of JavaScript, Stylus, Jade, etc.<p>Super fun place to work (socially). More importantly, there&#x27;s plenty of freedom and time to try out new tech. Quick turnover of projects mean you&#x27;re less likely to get bored. Good place to grow your skills, as us seniors love to help!<p>Email me: yosh@imperodesign.com<p>Impero - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;weareimpero.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;weareimpero.com</a>","time":1438622294,"type":"comment"}
