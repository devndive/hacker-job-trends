We&#x27;re a growing team of 85, based in Edinburgh but with remote staff around the UK (7 engineers are fully remote).<p>We have a lot of happy customers (40,000+, NPS=76!), a lot of traffic (13 million+ page views&#x2F;mo), and some lovely staff to work alongside, learn from and have fun with. We invest a lot of time in our platform (code health, scalability, security) as well as working on new features, which is nice.<p>Our engineers tend to be full stack, but weâ€™re seeing people move towards more specialist work these days, such as front-end programming (we&#x27;re doing a lot of React.js, primarily on our iOS app), our real-time accounting engine, data science. People play to their strengths really. Our stack is intentionally straightforward. It&#x27;s sensible and sustainable. Javascript aside, we mainly write Ruby alongside MySQL, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch, Puppet.<p>We are looking for <i>UK-based</i> full-time staff only right now.<p>Job listings and applications via <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;freeagent.workable.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;freeagent.workable.com</a><p>Our Engineering Blog can be found at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;engineering.freeagent.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;engineering.freeagent.com</a>","time":1438614701,"type":"comment"}
