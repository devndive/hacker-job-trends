When we released our first application – Timeline - News in Context – on January 15, 2015, it was immediately featured by the App Store Editors and then re-featured at the beginning of February as the best app of the month of January. They loved us so much that Timeline is now featured on iPhones in many Apple Stores worldwide.<p>Timeline team members work in a comfortable and results-oriented environment that comes with a great deal of autonomy, competitive compensation, and generous benefits. Equally important, people here believe deeply in what they&#x27;re doing. Timeline is driven by a passion for a big idea. The world deserves better information. In one word, they deserve more context.
