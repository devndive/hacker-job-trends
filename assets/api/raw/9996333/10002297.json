We are a skilful and informal bunch of people that highly respect craftsmanship and we are therefore looking for a competent Linux GNU&#x2F;Linux software- and system engineer to join our team in Delft full time.<p>Taking a radically novel approach to building cloud infrastructure, you are not afraid to face unique challenges in networking, storage and distributed systems. You have an opinion on how you want to solve such technical problems, but are not afraid to admit you were wrong yesterday. So were we. Really.<p>You want to automate everything, because you understand it is mandatory for keeping steady pace in development. You like to use modern tools like Ansible, Docker and Go, but also understand when Python and Bash serve you best. You are thrilled to experiment with new technologies like Rancher, Kubernetes, Vault, Consul and are confused or mildly upset that we failed to mention technology X here (come explain!).<p>If you can put checkmarks all over this list, get in touch:<p>- You are not allergic to champagne and confetti","time":1438678722,"type":"comment"}
