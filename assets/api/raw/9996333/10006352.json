If you specify your function parameter as an ARRAY then it operates as an AND, otherwise each argument is an OR.<p>For instance, to see posts that are remote and python OR remote and ruby, you can do<p>query([&#x27;remote&#x27;,&#x27;python&#x27;],[&#x27;remote&#x27;,&#x27;ruby&#x27;]);<p>The return of the function shows how many jobs were shown versus in total. For instance, as of this writing, I get the following result when running the above function:<p>{ shown: 56, total: 827 }","time":1438723135,"type":"comment"}
