We live-stream DJ sets from underground music hubs such as London, Berlin, New York, Paris, LA and many others to music lovers all over the world. It started as a webcam taped to a warehouse wall in East London - in five years it has grown to become the online home of underground music, and also a complex broadcasting and editorial platform in its own right.<p>Our website hasn’t caught up with this huge expansion - it currently runs on WordPress and is in sore need of a complete overhaul. We’re in the process of totally redesigning it, giving us the opportunity to choose the perfect tech stack. You’ll be an essential part of a dev team currently consisting of 2 developers and 2 designers. You ideally have strong opinions about how web development should be done in 2015, and you should be able to come up with and implement new ideas for consuming &amp; sharing online music experiences.<p>Going forward, we have some really exciting ideas around peer-to-peer audio and video streaming. We have upwards of a million pageviews on our site a month, and that’s not including the hundreds of millions of views that our videos have accumulated on YouTube and Dailymotion.<p>(...on top of that you’ll of course be able to go to &amp; invite your friends to our exclusive parties being live-streamed on the site!)<p>If this sounds like your kind of jam, give me a shout on harry.l+hn@boilerroom.tv!","time":1438617365,"type":"comment"}
