Biology is the next great engineering platform, and can be leveraged to make chemicals, biofuels, new materials, and generally improve many aspects of our economy. Ginkgo is applying disciplined engineering practices to standardize designing, building, and testing microbial strains. Using our platform, organism engineers can design and build hundreds of strains quickly, significantly increasing chances of success.<p>Want to use your programming, analytical, and informatics skills to change the world? This is your chance. We face many software challenges, from reverse engineering nature, to automating pathway design and construction, to automating data analysis, to debugging and modeling the cell. But, in 10 years, the biggest impact left by our efforts will not be any single piece of software, but a set of forward engineering rules that enables true design automation and makes biology a great engineering substrate.<p>Requirements: passionate about building the right tools to solve problems, motivated to learn skills you donâ€™t already have, comfortable using or picking up Python, Ruby, Javascript, and other programming tools. Relevant experience in molecular biology a big plus.<p>Interested?
