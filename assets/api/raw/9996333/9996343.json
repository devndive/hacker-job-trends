Most of our existing folks have a PL research and&#x2F;or formal methods background and enjoy demonstrating the correctness of their solutions with gusto: randomized test case generation, model checking in SPIN&#x2F;Promela or interactive theorem proving using Coq. We are active maintainers of the Cloud Haskell project and authors of the HaskellR project, among other open source contributions.<p>We are a distributed company with a presence across Europe (and a smidgeon in South America), but for this position we&#x27;re looking to have you join a local team near our headquarters here in Paris. We&#x27;re pretty happy to look at helping you relocate if you&#x27;re up to spending some time in this beautiful city. Fluency in French not required.<p>If you&#x27;d love the opportunity and the space to solve the hard problems of science&#x27;s large dataset infrastructure, by systematically decomposing them into simple, orthogonal solutions that compose and commute like in algebra, shoot us an email at jobs@tweag.io.","time":1438614059,"type":"comment"}
