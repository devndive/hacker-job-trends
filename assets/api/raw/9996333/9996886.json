We&#x27;re a completely bootstrapped startup that sells a web service that automates financial regulatory compliance. We&#x27;re a company of 15 right now, and somewhat unusually for a startup are growing rapidly through acquisition of customers rather than funding.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a full-stack engineer with a focus on user experience to work closely with our UX and Visual designer. You&#x27;ll take a huge role in shaping the evolution of our product - from tackling those small tweaks that can have an immediate impact for customers through to the broader user experience and the technical approach we want to take.<p>This isn’t some shiny but vacant consumer app. There’s real complexity both in terms of volumes of data that we deal with, and how we visualise the results of hundreds of rules running across thousands of portfolios – in a way that’s simple, understandable and easy to manage.<p>More here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fundapps.workable.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fundapps.workable.com&#x2F;</a> or email me direct - james@fundapps.co if you have questions.
