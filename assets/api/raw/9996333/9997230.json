We are known for our high-quality audio interfaces, our professional multi-track recording software, synthesizers, virtual instruments, and effects. Our products are depended upon by musicians like Beyoncé, Danny Elfman, Michael Giacchino, Alan Menkin, Pat Metheny, Alexandre Desplat, Pete Townshend, Cirque du Soleil and Madonna.<p>We&#x27;re a small, dedicated team of engineers based right in Harvard Square in Cambridge, MA. We are a different sort of full-stack: from the UI down to the DSP, the drivers, the FPGA and the physical hardware and everything in between. Our latest AVB line of hardware is a networked audio device that can stream hundreds of channels over ethernet following the AVB IEEE standard with just .625ms latency. Each unit has an embedded linux server that allows users to control it and mix in realtime from any device with a browser. Our DAW, Digital Performer, is a standard for film, TV and game composers around the world.<p>We develop mostly in C++11&#x2F;14, Python, CoffeeScript and JavaScript. They&#x27;re not prerequisites by any means, though, and we&#x27;re always excited to incorporate new technologies.<p>Interested in the future of digital audio and music creation?
