We process millions of dollars a month in payroll, provide access to healthcare that is significantly less expensive than standard small group rates and also automate tons of the really difficult and time consuming parts of running a business (tax filling, workers comp, epli etc.). We&#x27;re growing about 25% month over month.\nI really enjoy working here. We&#x27;re working on tough problems that really impact the entrepreneurial community. It&#x27;s nice to work on something that has a clear value and solves a clear problem for a group of people I care about. The team is excellent and the business is being run very well.\nContact info in profile, feel free to ask any questions or reach out to me directly.","time":1438624827,"type":"comment"}
