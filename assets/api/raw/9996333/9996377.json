We&#x27;re currently rebuilding our site to use Spree (so Spree experience preferred although not required) and we need an extra developer as soon as possible. You will need to be experienced building systems with complex business logic (there&#x27;s a surprising amount) and working with integrating third party protocols, APIs and file formats[1].<p>We test heavily using Rspec and Cucumber. We&#x27;re using the AWS stack (EB, S3, etc) and whilst knowledge of these would be beneficial it&#x27;s by no means a requirement. Postgres and CoffeeScript experience would be nice too. Lots of Rails experience is the main thing.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, please email bang@boomkat.com for more information or to apply. If applying, please include your CV &#x2F; Github &#x2F; links to any projects you&#x27;re proud of &#x2F; etc, as well as your availability and your day rate.<p>[1] Example of this is DDEX: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Digital_Data_Exchange\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Digital_Data_Exchange</a>","time":1438614229,"type":"comment"}
