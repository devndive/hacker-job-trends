We’re hiring for our data team.<p>It turns out that most of the work in machine learning and data science is around managing and scaling data. So we’re going to focus on developing this talent in house: we’ll hire smart full stack engineers and train them to get better at building data systems at scale. This opportunity to learn and level up is unparalleled.<p>There are a few dimensions here:<p><pre><code>  - scaling data infrastructure\n  - managing distributed systems\n  - manipulating and managing data\n  - acquiring, cleaning, and modeling data from 3rd party APIs and crawling\n  - applying machine learning algorithms, including some math to know why\n  - software engineering and systems design\n</code></pre>\nIt’s good to have some familiarity with our environment to hit the ground running. We write code in Python, deploy on Heroku, and use Postgres, Redis, and AWS data stores. We use the python data and machine learning libraries like numpy, scipy, pandas, and scikit-learn.<p>Email me: ivan@yesgraph.com","time":1438650043,"type":"comment"}
