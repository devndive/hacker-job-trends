We launched out of a Harvard University materials science lab a year ago, and just closed a $12M Series-A. We are actively seeking full time junior and senior software developers.<p>I am hiring developers interested in 3D printing who have experience with web technologies like Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and WebGL. We are also looking for embedded software developers to work on our printer firmware, and anyone interested in computational geometry.<p>And finally one role that may be a little different than what is out there is someone to manage &quot;DevOps&quot; on our printer. Our device runs linux on an internal single board computer. If you have experience managing linux systems on machines with limited resources then this job is for you. We need to ensure the machine is up and operating with high reliability.<p>If any of the above sounds interesting shoot me an email at jack@voxel8.co","time":1438653532,"type":"comment"}
