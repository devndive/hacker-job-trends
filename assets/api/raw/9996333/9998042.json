PipelineDB runs SQL queries continuously on large volumes of streaming data, giving companies the capability to easily develop scalable, realtime applications and services using only a familiar SQL interface. No application code is required. This inherently involves solving a lot of big problems, many of which are novel. We’re looking for creative engineers who appreciate the value and freedom of choosing their own projects, approaches, and working with other top talent in a low distraction, streamlined work environment. Our small team has backgrounds from Berkeley, MIT, Facebook, Locu and AdRoll, and we&#x27;re all doing exactly what we want to be doing: building a groundbreaking new product out of thin air. As an early stage engineer you&#x27;ll ultimately own a very large part of the product. Which part of the product you take charge of depends on where your interests are, but there are several different potential areas of focus. You&#x27;ll be entrusted to make sound architectural decisions as well as implement your vision effectively. We are well funded by top investors including SV Angel, Susa Ventures, Data Collective, Paul Buchheit, and more. If you’ve been waiting for an opportunity like this, please send your resume and a quick blurb about yourself to jobs@pipelinedb.com.<p>Benefits:\n* Full medical&#x2F;dental&#x2F;vision insurance * No set work hours--work when you feel smart * Choose your own setup * No vacation policy other than that it is strongly encouraged * Large equity ownership","time":1438623162,"type":"comment"}
