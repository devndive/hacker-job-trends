Basically we are &quot;making gaming social again&quot;. We&#x27;re in closed beta now, but will be opening up very soon!<p>The frontend is built in Clojurescript and Om, the backend in Clojure on a PostgreSQL database.\nWhile we do require some degree of prior experience with these technologies, we also greatly value an ability to learn, take ownership, be proactive, and communicate well with others.
