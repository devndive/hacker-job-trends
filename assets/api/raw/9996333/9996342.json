Because of Amara, tens of millions have been impacted through greater access to educational materials, news, entertainment, and more. Partner organizations such as Vimeo, GitHub, and TED (among many others) rely on Amara for subtitling tools and collaboration ecosystems.<p><i>What makes Amara Different?</i><p>Amara is developed by a non-profit organization, the Participatory Culture Foundation (PCF), whose mission is to build a more open, collaborative world.<p>Our work helps make video more accessible and global. The subtitling on Amara is completed on both volunteer and paid basis (depending on project), and as we grow, we’re asking: &quot;how do we build a more equitable future of work?&quot;<p>These goals and aspirations make PCF and Amara a fun and unique org. We’re a globally distributed team looking for empathic, creative, and driven people who want to make a difference.<p>If this is you, we’d love to chat!","time":1438614055,"type":"comment"}
