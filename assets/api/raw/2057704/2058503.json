Smart and fun people drinking free soda and working with groovy and grails, continuous integration, test coverage metrics, user stories, distributed version control, etc.  All the things you'd want and expect in a startup, plus a business model that actually has a shot at paying off as an added perk.","time":1293917259,"type":"comment"}
