We have 15 people worldwide and are well funded.  Actual LA office is in Santa Monica and we need people on site there. Looking for a lead web developer, ideally with exceptional JavaScript skills (not just playing around with JQuery), and we're looking for another senior visual designer.<p>It's a great team and if you're in the area or willing to relocate to LA, it's a fantasic opportunity to have the startup experience while not sacrificing competitive pay.
