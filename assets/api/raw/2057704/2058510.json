We're a non-profit, online news organization that covers state politics and policy in Texas. State and local governments spend more money than the federal government in America, yet far less attention is paid to what's going on outside of D.C. We aim to fix that.<p>We're currently working on improving and open-sourcing our CMS to allow other similar organizations to get off the ground much more quickly. We also build data apps that help our readers visualize, browse, and search through various data that the government puts out[1]. It's fun, fulfilling, and well-compensated work.<p>If you're interested, email me at nbabalola@texastribune.org. Include GitHub and HN usernames if you have them.<p>[1] Some examples:<p>Government Employee Salaries: <a href=\"http://www.texastribune.org/library/data/government-employee-salaries/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.texastribune.org/library/data/government-employee...</a><p>Prison Inmates: <a href=\"http://www.texastribune.org/library/data/government-employee-salaries/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.texastribune.org/library/data/government-employee...</a><p>Elected Officials: <a href=\"http://www.texastribune.org/directory/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.texastribune.org/directory/</a>","time":1293917484,"type":"comment"}
