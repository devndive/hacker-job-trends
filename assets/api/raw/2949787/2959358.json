The current stack is Ruby on Rails, MySQL, jQuery hosted on a VPS.<p>I need help with:<p><pre><code>    Setting up new Linux servers, including VPS and AWS\n    Getting data feeds from various UK retailers and affiliate networks\n    Scraping sites which do not have data feeds\n    Building systems for speeding up manual editing and correction of product data\n    Building backend admin tools\n    Documenting everything in a wiki\n</code></pre>\nYou'll get real responsibility and real power to do things the way you think is right. I'm a solo founder, so I expect you to learn, teach and document infrastructure stuff to help me focus on the core product.<p>I expect a good standard of work, so you're not expected to work for free.
