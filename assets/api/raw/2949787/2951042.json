We are a 4-person startup (2 biz guys, 2 developers) who are making web and iPhone apps to help small local businesses reach out to customers.<p>You get to figure out how to make the UI beautiful and the functionality flow like water--you'll handle the designing, Photoshopping, HTML/CSSing, jQuerying, user testing, etc..  We care first and foremost about katana-like elegance of functionality, and only secondarily about flash--but we're hoping you bring both.<p>We'll make the rest of the business model and tech stack work, though if you are interested in entrepreneurship or code we love teaching and building a kickass team together.<p>Let us know if you're interested, please include some portfolio action to: elliot@winasaurus.com<p>Looking forward to hearing from you!","time":1314899733,"type":"comment"}
