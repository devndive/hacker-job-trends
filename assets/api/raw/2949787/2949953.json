You can work from home, but need to be in the Boston area for occasional face-to-faces (and we may be getting office space near Burlington at some point).  We pay well, good benefits, cool team, lots of flexibility.<p>Sales/Marketing/Intern:  We're also looking for a paid co-op/intern to work (possibly part time) on our sales, marketing, and account management efforts.  Learn the ins and outs of working at a fast paced tech startup, and learn first hand how to sell to and deal with Fortune 500 executives.  Research into sales opportunities and competitors, authoring white-papers and PR releases, \"happiness\" management for existing customers, and more.  We're really looking for someone with some education or big ideas on how to effectively sell and market our company.  We're all tech-heads and need another perspective.  This could turn into high paid full time work, if the co-op proves to be valuable/productive.<p>Contact me: devon@sparkred.com with questions or resumes<p>Thanks!","time":1314884067,"type":"comment"}
