Your job will be to do similar things.<p>(If all that stuff sounds out of your league, it sounded out of mine too, until I got started.) We use javascript, python/django, hadoop, and haskell, though we really don't care if you've never touched any of those technologies.<p>Contact info is in my profile. Send a link to your github or other work you've done if you are interested. Here is our github: <a href=\"https://github.com/styloot\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/styloot</a><p>[1] We aren't jumping on a silly NoSQL bandwagon.
