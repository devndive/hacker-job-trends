My co-founder had to leave because he couldn't quit his job (boooo). I went all in and quit mine a few months ago (freeeeeedommm!!).<p>Social Tables is a web-based seating chart designer for weddings and other events with assigned tables. We help event/wedding planners create floorplans and assign their guests seats. We're called Social Tables because we have a social feature that lets guests meet who they'll be sitting with beforehand. We have a tested product, over 1,000 users, brand awareness, and deep industry expertise. In other words, we know our stuff and people love our product (we save an event planner 4 hours per event). We've been self-funded to date and are currently talking to interested angels.<p>Like I said, I'm looking for a CTO (understanding of Rails is a must, love for SproutCore is a big plus). You should have that startup fire burning in your belly, ridiculous drive (e.g. you like some degree of risk), appreciation of test-based development, and passion for learning new things.<p>If you're at all interested or just want to shoot the shit, send me a quick note: dan@socialtables.com - I love meeting new people and helping others out.","time":1314887348,"type":"comment"}
