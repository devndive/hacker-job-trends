Right now we're focused on mens fashion, but our ambitions are much larger.<p>pg did a good job of explaining the opportunity, here: <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/rfs2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ycombinator.com/rfs2.html</a><p>Here's a sample of some of the user feedback we get daily:<p>* I can't wait until you open a store.<p>* When are you going to start selling things?  I want to spend all my money with you.<p>* It's like you entered my brain and turned it into a store.<p>* I want to buy all my husband's clothes from you -- please start selling!<p>We're well-funded by really awesome investors and need engineers who are interested in building the next big online retail destination.<p>Our current stack is Ruby, Rails, MySQL, and Heroku, but smart and hungry beats knowledge of specific languages.<p>If you're interested send me an email at jesse@everlane.com and mention this post.  The most important thing is for you to be excited by the opportunity, so make it clear.<p>Bonus points for including a solution to this exercise in the language of your choice: <a href=\"http://static.everlane.com/everlane_exercise.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://static.everlane.com/everlane_exercise.pdf</a>","time":1304283558,"type":"comment"}
