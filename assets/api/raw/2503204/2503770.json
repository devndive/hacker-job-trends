Yammer helps turn the mayhem of the corporate world into return-on-investment unicorns and leveraged-employee-engagement butterflies.<p>We are a medium sized start-up that is battling several big enterprise software companies in this space. So yes, our target customers are in the enterprise space but we are turning this space upside down with our viral approach and how we build solutions for the user (which doesnâ€™t include an army of salesmen). We are solving consumer type problems but also monetize like enterprise software. (i.e. real revenues with fewer users)<p>What's in it for you?\n - Amazing group of smart engineers to work with. (Sounds cliche, but we really do have smart people here :D)\n - Ability to have influence without authority. Yammer is a product-focused and user-focused organization. Everything we do revolves around that.\n - We hack in Ruby/Rails, Scala/Java, Javascript/JQuery/Node.js/Adobe AIR, Obj-C for iOS, and some MSFT stuff for Sharepoint I don't know too much about. You'll probably find something you want to work on.\n - Good catered lunch and dinner daily, with a 3PM snack cart. (Really.)\n - Fancy Apple hardware of your choice (you can have a PC if you really want one.)\n - Our engineers can outdrink anyone.\n - Top of the market compensation.\n - Seriously, we rock.<p>For more information check out: <a href=\"https://www.yammer.com/about/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.yammer.com/about/jobs</a> or contact me: bkudria@yammer-inc.com<p>(Note: we also offer <i>real</i> referral fees.
