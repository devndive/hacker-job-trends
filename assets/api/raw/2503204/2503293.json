We are looking for full-timers and interns.<p>Factual aims to be the place where people meet to share, improve, and mash-up data. We have an awesome team that is still fairly small, and an incredible CEO (he was the co-founder of Applied Semantics, which was sold to Google and became AdSense). We recently raised a Series A from Andreessen-Horowitz, and our customers include Facebook (we provide some of their Places data) and Newsweek. We have lots of challenging problems to work on at all layers of the stack: data cleaning and canonicalization, deduping, storage, serving, APIs, etc. If you love data, Factual is the place to be.<p>We're looking for awesome Java generalists. Bonus points for experience with MapReduce, developing NoSQL datastores and/or machine learning.<p><a href=\"http://www.factual.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.factual.com/jobs</a><p>You can also email me personally at leo -at- factual.com","time":1304267371,"type":"comment"}
