We recently raised our B round, led by Crosslink Capital, the investors behind Pandora.<p>We are looking for test-driven engineers (and sysadmins) to work on an internet-scale video processing pipeline using Python, MySQL, Selenium, ffmpeg and other open source tools. Its goal is to find and ingest videos from web pages and to generate and store metadata about those videos using our vision algorithms written in C++.<p>You aren't expected to have a background in computer vision, but it would be great if you are interested in learning more about it. We are building a cross-functional team, so you will work closely with our computer vision experts to plan new capabilities and bring them into production.<p>We are also looking for computer vision experts who feel the need as we do to build an engine that can watch and understand all of the world's video. This is truly the greatest AI problem as there is no more quintessentially human activity than watching TV.<p>No remote hires, please. You must be willing to work at our office five days a week in a pair programming environment. Interns welcome.<p>If interested, please contact me (founder/ CTO) at bobby@affinesystems.com<p>Thanks.","time":1304274374,"type":"comment"}
