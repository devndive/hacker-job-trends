We just finished a prototype, raised some seed money, and are headed for greatness. Hopefully. This is a chance to work on some architecture from the outset of the product. I'd prefer those who have a possibility of coming on long-term as I build out the team, most likely around Palo Alto, but do have immediate needs that lead me to consider splitting up short-term chunks of development for freelancers. In any case, we're distributed for now so remote is the only possibility.<p>backend: postgres, python, django, gevent + gunicorn<p>frontend: coffeescript, jQuery, backbone.js, socket.io, modernizr, compass<p>I'm looking for:<p>1. Advanced web jacks-of-many-trades. You know a lot about several things from above and have at least tried your hand at a demo app using the rest. Backend/frontend/deployment.<p>2. A specialized front-end dev who knows their javascript in-and-out. We're designing a single page architecture for the most part. Mobile browser experience would be good.<p>3. Mobile app developers (native iPhone &#38; Android, though we're considering phonegap as well to get something out there faster).<p>We're staying distributed for now -- I'm based in Palo Alto but spend a fair amount of time with some of the team in DC as well.<p>gmail - davidmarble","time":1304291602,"type":"comment"}
