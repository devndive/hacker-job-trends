(We actually filled that opening via Hacker News!) This is a new position, similar to the previous one -- we're looking for someone very strong in and passionate about UI/UX work.<p>Our app is a SaaS project management system that makes it easy for users to visualize their work. While Rally's primary business is enterprise software, AgileZen's customers are primarily small teams and startups.<p>We started as a two-founder startup in Ohio in 2009 and were acquired by Rally in 2010. We're now a team of five with intentions of expanding to seven by the end of the year. We think and act very much like a startup, report to the CTO, and operate with relative autonomy within the company.<p>Experience in any development ecosystem (.NET, Java, Ruby, Python) is great, but JavaScript knowledge is a major plus. Our frontend is a whole bunch of JavaScript and CoffeeScript, and we're exploring doing more with Node.JS on the backend. We like people who are good at lots of things, and excellent at a few.<p>Review My App link on HN (from our launch in 2009): <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=691673\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=691673</a><p>More about us at: <a href=\"http://agilezen.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://agilezen.com/</a><p>More about the job at: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/kZrHzs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bit.ly/kZrHzs</a>","time":1304347433,"type":"comment"}
