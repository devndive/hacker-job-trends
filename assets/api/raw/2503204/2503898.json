We are self-funded, pre-launch, and small (4 in Seattle, 2 in SF). This is an opportunity to be in the first wave and help define how we do things.<p>What we most need right now is one or two great designers to own branding, interaction, and visual design for our web and device products. We're building consumer services, and having the right design will be important. We're committed to making sure designers are full partners in the development process. (See <a href=\"http://vurl.me/AYRJ\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://vurl.me/AYRJ</a>)<p>The current dev team is me plus three former Hashrocketeers in downtown Seattle. That's a great start, but we'd still love to hear from developers as well. (See <a href=\"http://vurl.me/AZHL\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://vurl.me/AZHL</a>)<p>We'd prefer to keep the dev/design team in Seattle for now, but we could bend this rule for an exceptional person who wants to be in SF.<p>BTW, my co-founder used to be CEO of Sun, so we have a lot of runway. Also, in addition to the usual startup chaos, we have a few big-company perks like salaries and health insurance. :)<p>Contact me at walter@pictureofhealth.com, or <a href=\"http://www.pictureofhealth.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.pictureofhealth.com/jobs</a>.","time":1304279955,"type":"comment"}
