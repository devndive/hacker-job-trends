We're primarily working on cellular wireless products.<p>Web Developer:<p>A big part of our primary product involves a monitoring/remote-control portal. We're wanting to invest more in it. At the start, you'll be responsible for maintaining and updating what we have now. Later, you will be involved in overhauling it. You'll have lots of input over the technologies you use to build it. You want to try MongoDB &#38; NodeJS? Awesome. Want to go with PHP &#38; MySQL? Also fine. You'll be involved in both back and front end development.<p>Embedded/Linux Programmer:<p>We use Busybox and Linux for most of our projects, others are bare-metal. Our projects mostly require userspace utilities and shell scripts. We sometimes also have driver work.<p>The team:<p>Our team is very enthusiastic but not overbearing. We all have a very broad skill set and love learning new things. The environment is low-pressure but driven to succeed. We're looking forward to growing our team.<p>Email shawn.goff@accns.com for more information.","time":1304269608,"type":"comment"}
