So, we need great people!<p>We're looking for great developers (and many other roles too) to work on a variety of exciting online projects. We use Clojure, Ruby, Hadoop, Node.js, Sinatra etc.<p>Above all we're looking for smart, ambitious, entrepreneurial people. Full job spec is here: <a href=\"http://www.forward.co.uk/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.forward.co.uk/careers</a> or here: <a href=\"http://www.forwardtechnology.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.forwardtechnology.co.uk/</a><p>And it's fun to work here: you choose the hardware you want, you buy the books you need, the hours are flexible, no dress code, the people are reasonable and the entertainment budget is generous: for example the entire company hangs out in Las Vegas night clubs and casinos for 4 days every December, not to mention other trips.<p>To find out more email me at evgeny.shadchnev@forward.co.uk with your CV.<p>p.s. sorry, all our devs are on-site, we don't hire remote devs. Also, given the recent changes to the immigration laws in the UK, it will be very challenging (maybe even impossible) for us to arrange a visa unless you're an EU national or already have a work permit.","time":1304277742,"type":"comment"}
