The listing says &quot;internship&quot; for the hiring program, but this is really a full-time permanent position in the agency.<p>Hard requirements are 1) U.S. Citizenship, and 2) that you be within 2 years of graduation (pre or post) from a degree-seeking program (undergraduate or graduate).<p>There is no specific language for this position (though Python + scipy + numpy is probably a big plus), the preference instead is on strong general CS fundamentals and interest in solving interesting problems. Broadly speaking, the responsibilities will be to provide assistance to a variety of different research and engineering projects through software development, as need arises.<p>This may sound a bit vague, but I&#x27;d be happy to describe some examples in more detail if anyone would like.<p>I am not technically on the hiring committee, but have agreed to help staff the position. PM me if you have any questions!<p><a href=\"https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/376181600\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usajobs.gov&#x2F;GetJob&#x2F;ViewDetails&#x2F;376181600</a>","time":1407252445,"type":"comment"}
