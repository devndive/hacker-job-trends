Think of it as Heroku for the Internet of Things if you must. We&#x27;ve already ported Docker to ARM CPUs and have hit quite a few more Linux, Docker &amp; ARM related milestones internally.\nWe are a company founded and led by developers and have a strong engineering-led culture. As long as there is progress, we are flexible with regard to location and work hours.<p>About you<p>---------<p>We are looking for Linux talent to work on our cloud services, deployed as Docker containers, but also to work on supporting arbitrary Linux-capable devices. The product is still young so you&#x27;ll get a chance to have real impact on how the end result looks and feels to our users.\nBesides strong Linux skills, familiarity with Docker will help a lot. Much of our codebase (on cloud and device) is in node.js so JavaScript skill is a plus.<p>The Process<p>-----------<p>Send us your CV (a pointer to source code online is a great plus). Those that pass a phone interview will receive a small but paid project as a test. If we like working with you and you like working with us, you&#x27;ll be offered a full-time job.<p>Get in touch<p>------------<p>send your CV to hello@resin.io","time":1406908422,"type":"comment"}
