You&#x27;ll be working closely with our frontend engineering team to develop a consistent design language which spans all of Octopart products.<p>Octopart sits at the intersection of electronic hardware and the web. The design challenges we face are unique:<p>- How do we display dense, highly technical information in ways that let the user process it without thinking too hard?<p>- How do we redesign our search interface so that searching is more natural and intuitive?<p>- What&#x27;s the right design language to use to communicate with a userbase that is partially engineers, and partially component purchasers?<p>The problems are hard, but the results will be rewarding, as our 700,000 monthly users spend less finding parts and more time designing new hardware. Your design skills will grow as you tackle these problems with us.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone full time, but we&#x27;re willing to start of working together on a contract basis.<p>We&#x27;re based in NYC near the flatiron, we&#x27;re backed by Y Combinator, we&#x27;re a team of 14, and we&#x27;ve been profitable since 2010.<p>Please send a link to your portfolio along with anything else to jobs@octopart.com.
