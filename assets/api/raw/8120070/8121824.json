Rather than opening lots of windows&#x2F;tabs or hopping from mobile app to mobile app, we&#x27;re building a platform that brings everything together.<p>We do this by connecting the services we use in a contextual way, through data technologies (search, machine learning, big data, etc.) and original thinking around UI&#x2F;UX.<p>We&#x27;re very well funded - Max Levchin, Drew Houston (Dropbox), Naval Ravikant (AngelList), CrunchFund, and many others. This is a hard problem, but it has the potential to change the behavior of how we do things on the Internet (and make it fun!)<p>Full-time opportunities in San Francisco (interview on-site, H1B transfers OK)<p>* Search &#x2F; Data Scientist &#x2F; Data Engineer - search, classification, ranking, ML, recommendation systems, NLP, graph dbs, data crawling&#x2F;processing.
