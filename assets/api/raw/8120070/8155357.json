The founding team includes the co-founder of Taxi Magic; an experienced Google and Dropbox engineer; the founder of Google Fiber; and the former lead designer at Dropbox.<p>We are looking for engineers who have strong product sense and are passionate about technology and user experience. This includes full-stack, frontend, backend, and mobile engineers. Join our team, come in at the ground level, and shape a product with great potential to transform an enormous market!<p>Our tech stack is HTML5, iOS, Android, and Go.<p>Cars are the largest retail vertical in the US – consumers buy almost 50 million new and used cars every year, totaling $1 trillion in value. Yet technology has barely touched the market; Americans buy cars in the same, burdensome ways they did decades ago. Selling a car means either letting the dealer collect a huge margin in a trade-in, or significant hassle selling to a private party. Our goal is to create a delightful experience for every person buying and selling a car, similar to Tesla’s customer service.<p>Shift is extremely well-funded (with a seed round as large as many A rounds), has strong partnerships with key strategic players across the value chain, and has done dozens of sales in San Francisco. We are lean and hypothesis-driven, led by engineering and design. We work hard together, have fun together, and our culture is healthy and respectful.<p>talent@shiftcars.com","time":1407536180,"type":"comment"}
