{"by":"nwells","id":8136818,"parent":8120070,"text":"Kit Check is a DC based startup. Our technology blends hardware and software to track medications using RFID in hospitals and other acute-care settings. In the last year, we&#x27;ve grown from 7 to 84 hospitals and are expecting to add another 70 by the end of this year alone.<p>The reason weâ€™re so successful is that our product allows hospitals to save money while also saving lives through a drastic reduction in human errors.<p>Our applications are written in angularJS, and Ruby on Rails and run in AWS. We use RDS for our data and as we rapidly collect more drug tracking and administration data we will need to build out a data analytics platform, as well. We need top-notch talent to solve very interesting problems at the intersection of hardware and software, the cloud and data analytics.<p>We have a very strong team of engineers and I am looking for a highly talented front end engineer who enjoys pushing the AngularJS envelope (backbone or knockout skills are also applicable).<p>You would be part of a team that is changing healthcare and pushing the model of a modern SaaS company.\nWe are able to offer relocation to the right person. Please email nicole@kitcheck.com if you are interested.","time":1407246194,"type":"comment"}
