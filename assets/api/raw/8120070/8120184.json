Take a small risk and join us in building a growth business.<p>Who are we?\nBefore any meeting, Charlie automatically researches people before you see them.  Researching people is a complex problem: we sift through, analyze, and manipulate data into powerful insights (i.e. what are they passionate about, what do you have in common?).

We’re a funded startup, backed by some very awesome VC’s and prominent angel investors.<p>We’ve built Charlie to research people at massive scale, using the latest Ruby on Rails stack with MongoDB, Redis, Sidekiq, and hosted in an elastic cloud farm.  We write code with agility and have a tight process where anyone on the team can deploy to production at any time, without approval.  We thoroughly test our code, though we’re not strict TDD.  We&#x27;re a small dev that loves to code, and constantly pushes, and learns from each other.<p>This is your opportunity to join an early-stage company that’s making moves.  Sound interesting?
