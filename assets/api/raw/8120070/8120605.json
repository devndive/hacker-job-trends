People who don&#x27;t just want to build tools, but actual infrastructure products, for the rest of the product organization. Want to touch provisioning, package&#x2F;configuration&#x2F;service management, monitoring, deployments, network &amp; datacenter tooling, etc. in an environment with &gt;10,000 hosts? We&#x27;re currently solving very challenging problems at a large scale and are looking for people to build out the next generation of operational infrastructure.<p>You can apply through the website but if you have any questions, I&#x27;m on the SRE team, feel free to email me at gary@dropbox.com.","time":1406907630,"type":"comment"}
