We do everything from WordPress sites to our own products to custom web and mobile apps, and most of our work relates to politics&#x2F;issue advocacy. We&#x27;re particularly passionate about Internet freedom issues. Right now we&#x27;re gearing up to launch a new product so it&#x27;s a pretty exciting time. Check out our portfolio here: <a href=\"http://enga.ge/work/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;enga.ge&#x2F;work&#x2F;</a>.<p>Anyway, we are looking for a college student with back or front-end talent (PHP&#x2F;MySQL or Javascript&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;CSS). Must be in the DC area or willing to relocate; foreigners welcome as long as you can secure a visa on your own (usually J-1 or F-1).\nAlso, note that we treat our interns well and hire them. In fact, one of our current developers used to intern here, as did I. And, management doesn&#x27;t really care if you have side projects, which is always nice.<p>To apply, please send me an email directly to michele@engagedc.com with the subject &quot;Developer intern from Hacker News&quot; (I&#x27;m the technical project manager). Include your resume, GitHub&#x2F;portfolio link and a brief description of why you want to work with us. Hope to hear from you!<p>(Repost from July thread.)","time":1406915484,"type":"comment"}
