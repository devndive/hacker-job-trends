Our commercial clients include international auto manufacturers, major television networks, and national retailers.<p>We’re building a platform that will transform businesses’ customer relationship management (CRM) and their approaches to marketing. Business CRM platforms focus on the past purchase behavior of existing customers -- these generate stale insights and say little about where to hunt for growth. Our platform will incorporate outside data sources as well as live research in order to generate up-to-date and actionable leads.<p>We’re looking for top-notch Backend and Frontend Engineers to join our team in New York or Washington, DC. We’re a small company (and growing!) so engineers must be ready to contribute to the technical vision of our organization and take ownership of real projects, from design to development to deployment.<p>Backend engineers should be strong Python web application developers. We use Django for larger, client-facing projects and Flask for smaller, internal-facing APIs. Frontend engineers should have strong familiarity with client-side development in JavaScript, familiarity with HTML and CSS, and a good sense of design. Familiarity with database design and administration (we use MySQL) as well as version control (we use Git) are also important.<p>We offer competitive compensation and benefits. We value diversity and encourage engineers from all backgrounds to apply.<p>Interested? Send an email to engineering@haystaqdna.com.","time":1406909213,"type":"comment"}
