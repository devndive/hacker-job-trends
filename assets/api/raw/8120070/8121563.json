Our respective mobile teams have 7 members apiece, and we have about a 1:1 QA to dev ratio.

Salary is top-notch for the northeast. Very chill office environment, free gym membership, bring your dog in, stocked kitchen, that kind of deal.And New Hope is a fantastic town for afternoon walks and Starbucks runs.<p><a href=\"http://www.meetmecorp.com/careers/jobs-available/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.meetmecorp.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;jobs-available&#x2F;</a>","time":1406913576,"type":"comment"}
