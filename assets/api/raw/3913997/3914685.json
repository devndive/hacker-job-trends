Our software helps scientists manage, analyze and collaborate around their drug discovery data (chemistry and biology). We are are in a great position to support the evolution towards more collaboration, specialization and distribution in a market that has been historically closed and secretive. The model has been successful with academic labs, small biotech startups and very large collaborations (like the Gates foundation TB initiative or MM4TB in Europe). We are now gaining some traction with government agencies and the big pharmaceuticals.<p>I am hiring a full-stack software developer (<a href=\"https://www.collaborativedrug.com/pages/employment#h-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.collaborativedrug.com/pages/employment#h-1</a>). As one of three developers, you need to be comfortable working or interested in building expertise at every level of the stack. Experience or interest in system administration and operations is nice to have though not required. We have many projects involving web development, data visualization, data processing, scaling, security, privacy and other software challenges to make our scientific application collaborative, engaging and rewarding.<p>It is perfectly OK if you do not have experience with any of the languages or technologies we currently use (Rails/Ruby/JS/MySQL/Solr...) as long as you can learn those quickly.\nCDD is a great place if you want to have a lot of impact and like to take on projects and responsibilities.<p>If you are interested, contact work@collaborativedrug.com, you will get an answer from one of the developers.","time":1335885148,"type":"comment"}
