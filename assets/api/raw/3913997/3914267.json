We're a young company with experienced founders and a bit of seed money. We are hard at work building out our publishing platform and creating apps for each industry vertical. Pull up constructiondive.com or utilitydive.com on your phone to get a rough idea of where we're headed. (I'll let you in on a little secret: B2B isn't as sexy as working on the next Instagram of Spotify, but there's a lot of money there and the B2B publishing industry is ripe for disruption.)<p>We've got a variety of projects that would be a good fit for a developer intern interested in web design, mobile apps, and/or stable and scalable architecture. Our primary stack is Python/Django (with a little bit of PHP), but being smart and eager to learn is more important than any prior specific technical skills.<p>We're also looking for editorial interns interested in aggregating content and writing features &#38; news summaries.<p>Email eli-at-industrydive.com for details.","time":1335880113,"type":"comment"}
