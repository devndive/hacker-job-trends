Our focus is on groups and events (\"spur of the moment, on the fly\"). We think we have something unique to offer the world and are launching a native iOS app in a few weeks and expanding to web and mobile web next.<p>The founders are straight shooters who value clear communication and getting stuff done. We're obssessed with creating a product that fills what we see as a major hole in social networking software -- helping people more efficiently connect in real-life with close networks so they can spend more of their time building and enriching real relationships.<p>Technologies:<p><pre><code>    • frontend: coffeescript, jQuery, backbone.js, socket.io, compass\n\n    • backend: python, django, gevent, gunicorn, nginx, postgres\n</code></pre>\nWe need some knowledge/experience optimizing and scaling some or all of the above technologies to handle growth, and building real-time single-page architecture sites or mobile web.<p>Immediate front-end needs include design and development of our desktop web and mobile web versions and giving thoughtful consideration to iPhone workflows as we get feedback from users.<p>Full-stack devs are needed to help optimize and expand our API, re-assess our real-time web architecture, add background processing for actions triggered by the API calls, optimize queries, and support what's going to potentially be a wild ride as we do launch events over the next few months.<p>gmail - davidmarble (main tech guy on the founding team)","time":1335883602,"type":"comment"}
