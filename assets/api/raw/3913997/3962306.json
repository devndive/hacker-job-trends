We're building a SQL engine, fulltext search, and more on top of HBase. It's incredibly fun because we get to build a database <i>from scratch</i>, and we get to do some really cool stuff with distributed systems.<p>We’re obsessed with building pragmatic things that work in “the real world” and joining them with the most cutting-edge distributed systems research. We’ve built and run some of the largest companies and infrastructures: Sun, Amazon, Google, Intel, and more. Even the CEO codes almost every day.<p>Engineer: Database Core / Distributed Systems: San Francisco<p>Help our core team build a database from the ground up. Finally, you can do things “the way they should be”. Instead of a db from the 1980′s, we’re creating a platform for modern, real-time applications.<p>Here are some things you may enjoy doing or learning about:<p>-Building query planners and optimizers\n-Compiler design\n-Functional programming (Scala, Clojure, etc.)\n-Distributed systems architecture: failover, replication\n-JVM tuning and performance hacks\n-Turning academic research into reality\n-Resilient systems for the real world\n-Engineer: Operations and Automation: San Francisco<p>Yes, this is a “DevOps” role. If you like coding <i>and</i> systems work, you’re going to enjoy this. You’ll be the one responsible for building clusters that heal themselves and deploy seamlessly in the cloud or customer sites.<p>-Cluster automation\n-Deployment frameworks like Chef, Puppet, CFEngine\n-Building monitoring tools that you enjoy using\n-Upgrading and recovering from failure with no downtime\n-How to make Linux behave\n-Hadoop/HBase/BigTable/other distributed systems\n-And perhaps a bit of UX hackin’","time":1336786565,"type":"comment"}
