It is just now becoming possible thanks to recent advances in mobile technology and the product is incredibly rewarding to work on. Our days are full of interesting challenges around UI/UX, engineering, and machine learning. Our goal is to give you a sixth sense about the world around you, showing you things that you’ve never been able to see before. It’s difficult and ambitious, which is what makes it fun.<p>We launched in January and the response has been very exciting. We recently closed a round of funding from Benchmark Capital, SV Angel, Crunchfund, and a great group of angel investors.<p>We want to make Highlight an amazing place to work, with a creative, open culture that deeply values both engineering and design.  If you are excited about what we are doing we would love to hear from you.<p>You can reach us at jobs@highlig.ht.<p>For more details, please see <a href=\"http://highlig.ht/jobs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://highlig.ht/jobs.html</a>.","time":1335890551,"type":"comment"}
