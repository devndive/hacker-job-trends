There's a huge problem with the way kids in the US learn math: lack of basic arithmetic fundamentals. We want to fix this problem using an alternative East meets West adaptive curriculum, and we could use your help.<p>We're a NYC startup, a bit different from the Silicon Valley boys, more results oriented, less fluff and you can bet that everyone on your team is as talented and driven as you. We have awesome proprietary technology and architecture that's going to make a huge impact on math e-Learning and are already working with several schools, organizations, and private consumers. They agree what we have works.<p>This is your chance to \"do good by doing good\"-- get competitive compensation, cash + equity, and make a real difference in the world.<p>Like everyone and their grandmothers, we're looking for talented engineers, Javascript/PHP/AJAX/MySQL. Bonus points if you're UX oriented and have a keen eye for cool design or hopped on the iOS SDK early and are a guru at objective C.<p>You gotta be laid back, we're all going to be spending long hours together and don't want to work with anyone too high strung. After all, most of the times you'll need to see problems from a child's perspective.<p>If this sounds like something you're interested in, tell us why and send your resume/portfolio to recruiting@thefactortree.com with HN in the subject title.<p>www.thefactortree.com","time":1336154966,"type":"comment"}
