The company is several hundred employees and nearing a hundred in engineering.  Things are organized in small teams and you get to have a big impact.  We were also named the #2 place in Massachusetts to work.<p>On the backend, we use Java (modern Java with DropWizard, Guice, and the like) and Python (Django).  We love using JSON to get things done.  For storage, there&#x27;s HBase, Hadoop (for MapReduce jobs), MySQL, ZooKeeper, Redis, and Memcached.  We do great monitoring and deploy hundreds of times a day.  We use CI and have automated deployment.  Don&#x27;t expect your code to languish in git (we have GitHub Enterprise) for long.<p>On the front end, we use Backbone.js, CoffeeScript, and jQuery.<p>We&#x27;re also looking for iOS and Android engineers.<p>Work schedule seems flexible (most engineers work 10-6), you get great equipment (like a Retina MacBook Pro and Thunderbolt display), and you get to make a meaningful difference in the product.  There&#x27;s free drinks (including beer), snacks, etc.<p>It&#x27;s a great place to be and hope you come join us!  We have lots of positions open.<p>Software Engineer: <a href=\"http://jobvite.com/m?3UQdwgwe\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobvite.com&#x2F;m?3UQdwgwe</a><p>JavaScript: <a href=\"http://jobvite.com/m?3iQdwgwC\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobvite.com&#x2F;m?3iQdwgwC</a><p>Infrastructure Automation and Tooling: <a href=\"http://jobvite.com/m?3wRdwgwR\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobvite.com&#x2F;m?3wRdwgwR</a><p>Mobile, iOS, Android, JS: <a href=\"http://jobvite.com/m?3XRdwgwi\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobvite.com&#x2F;m?3XRdwgwi</a><p>Core Data (Hadoop, HBase): <a href=\"http://jobvite.com/m?34Rdwgwp\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobvite.com&#x2F;m?34Rdwgwp</a><p>Reliability: <a href=\"http://jobvite.com/m?3HSdwgw3\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobvite.com&#x2F;m?3HSdwgw3</a><p>Technical Lead: <a href=\"http://jobvite.com/m?3zSdwgwV\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobvite.com&#x2F;m?3zSdwgwV</a>","time":1404223834,"type":"comment"}
