The crowdfunding site for ongoing projects.\nSan Francisco, CA.<p>Software Engineers: Full-stack, Mobile, DevOps<p>Yesterday we were featured in SFGate with pictures of the apartment we were working out of but, as of today, we have a beautiful new office on 9th Street, South of Mission.<p>A vibrant community of artists and musicians are already using the site and it continues to grow. We just closed our Series A round. We&#x27;re in that moment of transition where the site has stopped being a project written by two enthusiastic roommates and becomes a real company. This means that there&#x27;s a huge amount of work to do on every level of the stack. The existing site is written in PHP, but we&#x27;ve already started adding Node.js services to do the heavy-lifting for new features. As our third full-time engineer, you&#x27;d help us figure out the technology stack we use as we grow.<p>More information at <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.patreon.com&#x2F;jobs</a> .
