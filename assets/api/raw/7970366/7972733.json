The founding team includes the co-founder of Taxi Magic; an experienced Google and Dropbox engineer; and a long-time Google Product Manager.<p>We are looking for engineers who have a strong product sense and are passionate about both technology and user experience. This includes full-stack, front-end, back-end, and mobile engineers. Join our team, come in at the ground level, and shape a product that has great potential to transform a huge market!<p>Our tech stack is HTML5, iOS, Android, Go, App Engine, and AWS.<p>Cars are the largest retail vertical in the US – consumers buy almost 50 million new and used cars every year, totaling $1 trillion in value. Yet technology has barely touched the market. Americans buy cars in the same, burdensome ways they did decades ago. Selling a car means either letting the dealer collect a huge margin in a trade-in, or significant hassle selling to a private party. Our goal is to create a delightful experience for every person buying and selling a car, similar to Tesla’s customer service.<p>Shift is extremely well-funded (with a seed round as large as many A rounds), has strong partnerships with key strategic players across the value chain of the car buying process, and has done dozens of sales in San Francisco. We are lean and hypotheses-driven, led by engineering and design. We work hard together, have fun together, and strive to ensure a healthy and respectful culture.<p>talent@shiftcars.com","time":1404240753,"type":"comment"}
