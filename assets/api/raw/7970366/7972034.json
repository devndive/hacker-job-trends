Can you think up mind-blowing solutions to complex, hairy problems? Do you get excited by things like graph databases and machine learning? We want someone who can move fast, think creatively, and deliver quality&#x2F;tested code. Is this you?  Have at least a couple years of professional experience writing code.  Take a small risk and join us in building a growth business.<p>Who are we?\nBefore any meeting, Charlie automatically researches people before you see them.  Researching people is a complex problem: we sift through, analyze, and manipulate data into powerful insights (i.e. what are they passionate about, what do you have in common?).  CNBC called us “One of the world’s most promising new companies” and SXSW selected us as an Accelerator Finalist.<p>We’ve built Charlie to research people at massive scale, using the latest Ruby on Rails stack with MongoDB, Redis, Sidekiq, and hosted in an elastic cloud farm.  We write code with agility and have a tight process where anyone on the team can deploy to production at any time, without approval.  We thoroughly test our code, though we’re not strict TDD.  We&#x27;re a small dev that loves to code, and constantly pushes, and learns from each other.<p>This is your opportunity to join an early-stage company that’s making moves.<p>Interested?
