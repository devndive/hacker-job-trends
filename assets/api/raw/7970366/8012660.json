I was working for a start-up called LucidMedia Networks (hence the &quot;lmn&quot; in the e-mail address below), which got acquired by Videology.  Our stack is Java on Spring on *nix with MySQL and some NoSQL stores on AWS.  The Baltimore office also has a team on a large .NET stack as well, but Java teams are spread across both offices.  We have some big projects in the works involving big data and volume as we scale globally and across mediums (video, mobile, etc.).  Currently, our Reston platform alone handles 4 billion requests a day.<p>Contact me directly at sahil_lmn@yahoo.com.<p>I actually got hired through a HN &quot;Who is Hiring&quot; thread, and I hired an intern through these threads. These things do work!","time":1404946410,"type":"comment"}
