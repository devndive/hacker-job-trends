We normalize, scrub, and then re-distribute all this data to customers in all of those countries in an efficient manner. The Terminal provides analytic and visualization tools to work with market data, as well as the same tools to work with news and alerts. On the news side, we ingest over 80,000 news feeds (e.g. WSJ would be one &quot;feed&quot;) from around the world and do the same kind of processing, applying ML for sentiment and topic classification, machine translation, etc. The web side (bloomberg.com, businessweek.com, Government, Law, etc) uses mostly Rails stacks and everything you would expect to find in a web shop.<p>If you want to join a team in the single digits and work for one of the most profitable software companies in the world, contact me -- andrew@ishiboo.com (personal e-mail)","time":1404220569,"type":"comment"}
