Looking for smart, relatively senior devs and designers. No remote, but we&#x27;ll pay relocation expenses if you&#x27;re not local and we&#x27;ve sponsored two H1Bs so far.<p>We&#x27;re the prettiest entrant in a traditionally un-pretty industry: real estate. This is an entrenched industry that is overdue for some innovation, and it&#x27;s a great opportunity to work on improving the difficult experience of finding a home. Your rent payment is probably the biggest bill you pay every month.<p>It&#x27;s a great time to join because we&#x27;ve recently hit an inflection point, especially in SF where it&#x27;s hard to find an apartment. We&#x27;re on Lifehacker regularly, featured in last month&#x27;s WIRED magazine, and 7x7 named us one of the top startups changing the world.<p>We&#x27;re just over 20 people right now but we&#x27;re growing as fast as we can find people. We just signed a lease for our first office by ourselves, a gorgeous 6000sqft building.\nI run engineering -- ex-YC, Django dev, been in the real estate space most of my life. I&#x27;d be happy to answer any of your questions: zain@livelovely.com.","time":1404231898,"type":"comment"}
