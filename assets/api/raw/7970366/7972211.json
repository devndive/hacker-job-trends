SPINS is the leading provider of analytics, reporting, and insights for the natural, organic, and specialty products industry. We deliver analytics to naturally-focused retailers and manufacturers, based on point-of-sale data, transactional data, and other sources.<p>Technologies we&#x27;re using include Java, Hadoop&#x2F;Pig, DB2&#x2F;MySQL&#x2F;PostgreSQL, REST, and AngularJS. We use agile development, git, and maven.<p>Reasons I love working here:<p>- SPINS is about 100 people, but still like a startup in some ways. There&#x27;s a great team and good resources, but everyone is friendly, casual, flexible on hours and which office you work from. There&#x27;s free snacks, biweekly masseuse, that sort of thing.<p>- We are at the intersection of two awesome growth industries: big data analytics, and natural foods&#x2F;products.<p>- We are spinning up some cool tech projects: Moving all our processing to Hadoop, new responsive webapps, and mobile later this year.<p>You can see some postings at <a href=\"http://spins.atsondemand.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;spins.atsondemand.com&#x2F;</a>, or feel free to ping me at snoto@spins.com if you&#x27;re interested in any engineering role.","time":1404235946,"type":"comment"}
