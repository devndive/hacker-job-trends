Our goal is to index the state and functionality of apps as well as Google indexes the web, and then present app functionality directly to users in search results. We currently provide iOS and Android app search that soundly beats Google Play and iTunes in blind tests.<p>We have a variety of projects in Python (most of our web-facing stuff, mid-tier services, and our search API), Java (our relevance engine and other computationally intensive code) and Clojure (our app content pipeline.)<p>We&#x27;re basically hiring most good generalist software engineers, or engineers with domain knowledge relevant to any of our work (e.g. analytics, scraping, semantic web, machine learning, search, web development, Android development and internals.) Email me at mquander@quixey.com for details or a referral.<p>We also host the South Bay Less Wrong meetups on Tuesday evenings, so stop by the office and check it out!","time":1404238604,"type":"comment"}
