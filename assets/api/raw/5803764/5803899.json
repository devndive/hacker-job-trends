We're known for our bravado and our aim to always overdeliver on our client's expectations. Right now we're working on establishing a development-centric New York City office. The NY office will focus primarily on long-term \"product\" projects.<p>We're seeking one or two experienced Rails and/or JS developers. You'll be working directly with yours truly. We're going to make some seriously killer stuff.<p>Full-time salary with a great benefits package. You'll be instrumental in creating the office itself - we're starting with a blank slate. Occasional (every couple weeks, if that) travel to HQ in Philadelphia will be required. We are not a start-up, full compensation is not a concern.<p>Send me a note: interactivejobs (at) redtettemer (dot) com.<p><a href=\"http://redtettemer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://redtettemer.com/</a>","time":1370094165,"type":"comment"}
