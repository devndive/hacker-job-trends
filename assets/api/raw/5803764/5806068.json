I'm hoping HN can help me come up with a good title for the position (We've been calling it Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) but the more people we talk to the more it sounds like that isn't quite right).  The job is:<p>1/3 of the time you'll be either the call leader for an outage situation or following up on a previous outage to determine root cause and what can be done to prevent that class of failure in the future.<p>1/3 of the you'll be working with teams throughout the company evangelizing best practices for reliability, scalability and distributed computing, such as helping them figure out caching strategies or how to use queues more effectively or avoiding global locks.<p>The last 1/3 of your time will be spent coding (mostly in Python) writing tools that help maintain the reliability of Netflix.  Some tools we have written are an intelligent alert routing gateway, and tool to keep track or changes throughout the AWS environment, and simple tools like one that keeps track of EIP assignments or collects tcpdumps to send to Amazon.<p>So HN, what do you think the title of this role should be?  Also, I didn't include the work DevOps in the description because it feels overused, but do you think it should be in there?","time":1370121738,"type":"comment"}
