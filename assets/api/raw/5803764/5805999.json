We'd love you to join us.<p>We are looking for a generalist Ruby and PHP developer who is comfortable with front-end development and sysadmin tasks. Our stack varies from project to project, but includes:<p>- Rails, Sinatra, Drupal, and Wordpress websites, deployed with Capistrano<p>- MySQL and MongoDB databases, with SOLR for search<p>- Ubuntu on our bare-metal servers, provisioned using Chef<p>- Front-end development using JQuery, LESS and the usual gamut of interesting libraries in Javascript and CSS<p>- Git for SCM<p>You'll be comfortable collaborating on a range of projects, taking the lead on technology choices, learning new things every day, and taking part in every area of the business. We are specifically looking for help with the development of a large Rails project, but there are always lots of other things going on - Skype bots, Wordpress sites, nascent ideas for mobile apps; if you have an idea, pitch it and make it happen!<p>We're a relaxed bunch, and working at Error is both interesting and fun. We're committed to investing in you, and you'll have the option of a share of the business after your first year of employment. We'll obviously be providing you with whatever hardware you need to do your job; we're Mac people but you can choose whatever you like.<p>Error's lovely studio is in Liverpool, but we'd certainly consider a UK-based remote employee.<p>If this appeals, get in touch with Ed Jones at ed@errorstudio.co.uk<p>[edit: formatting]","time":1370120472,"type":"comment"}
