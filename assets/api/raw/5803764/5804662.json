(Nasdaq: LLNW) is the content delivery partner for thousands of entertainment, technology, enterprise, and government entities around the globe. Our customers include some of the greatest companies in the world: Netflix, HBO, Amazon, Pokemon and thousands more. If you have ever watched video or read a web page on the Internet, chances are that they were delivered using Limelight technology.<p>Our team began as a start-up in Pioneer Square here in Seattle, and were acquired in 2010. The acquisition has gone well, with no turnover in the development team as a result, and we are growing our team.  We still like to keep the office as informal and start-uppy feeling as legally possible. Pretty much as long as you wear clothes, can handle inflatable palm trees and out-of-season holiday decorations, and can put on your professional face when needed, you'll be fine.","time":1370104574,"type":"comment"}
