We're scaling machine learning and operations research to tens of thousands of CPUs.<p>Our team's language of choice is Clojure, but we operate in a polyglot environment. We love using things that the rest of the world has built, and we recognize the benefits of contributing back. We believe in the Unix way. We often show our code to each other as we iterate towards simpler designs.<p>Two Sigma is a career destination for the intellectually curious who want to learn, invent, and create in a collaborative, down-to-earth environment. The people of Two Sigma – a dynamic and diverse group of scientists, researchers, and engineers – are accomplished analytical thinkers and passionate problem solvers.<p>We are a technology company that applies a rigorous, scientific method-based approach to investment management. Since our founding in 2001, Two Sigma’s vision has been to develop technological innovations that intelligently analyze the world’s data to consistently deliver value for our clients.<p>While we analyze the data-rich domain of finance, financial experience is not necessary.<p>If you're excited about working with us, please send your qualifications to buildstuff [at] twosigma.com.","time":1370100175,"type":"comment"}
