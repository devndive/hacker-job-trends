Does years of experience determine who the best engineers are? How about a whiteboarding session with people peppering you with questions - is that how you normally work?<p>We may only be a simple startup, but we have this crazy idea that your past work, production code and open source contributions are the best indicators of your ability. If these are high quality, let’s talk.<p>Who we are:<p>A small group (under 10) that has built two consumer facing products. We’re technology agnostic and believe the best developers can teach themselves what they need to learn. There are no politics, no prima donnas and we just like getting things done.<p>Edviso is a consultation marketplace for experts to give advice via live video chat.\nCatincan is a crowdfunding platform for open source projects.<p>What we need:<p>Software Engineer that solves problems. You’re someone that figures things out, cares about code quality and understands the choices you make can lead to technical debt. You like learning new languages and have your own method that’s worked for you time and again to get spun up on something quickly.
