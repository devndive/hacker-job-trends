Software Engineer.<p>We're hiring :)<p>Come hack the news.<p>The Guardian are predominantly a Scala shop but use anything that does the job. We're into that whole agile thing, so expect a minimum of bureaucracy.<p>My team works on The Guardian's Content Platform, the central infrastructure that enables virtually everything we do here. The Content API holds a datastore of Guardian content from the 90's to the present day and serves about twenty million requests for it every day. It powers large chunks of our desktop site, as well as the entire mobile site, our Android/iPhone/iPad/Kindle apps, our syndication business and a heap of lucrative partnerships. We're also the ones best placed to be looking at non-traditional revenue streams â€“ how do we generate value from our content except through our own ad-support properties?<p>We have hard problems to solve. We offer a competitive salary. And, it being The Guardian, health insurance and a good pension come as standard.<p>Ping cantlin at guardian.co.uk if you want to grab a coffee.","time":1370250035,"type":"comment"}
