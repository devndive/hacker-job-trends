Our customers range from vast multinationals to small private intelligence outfits.<p>We are looking for at least two developers to help us accelerate work on the myriad hard problems that we are solving. Currently we are a team of eight - with four engineers - so you would have a huge opportunity to shape the technological future of the company.<p>Startup atmosphere, real salary, flexible working hours and quality equipment provided.<p>We are a Python shop so expertise in that (and, inevitably, JavaScript) is a strong advantage (Django is our framework of choice). We have a number of different application components, including multiple distributed applications, so experience orchestrating large numbers of machines with tools like Chef or even Fabric would help. Above all though we want smart, multitalented people who can think for themselves and take pride in their work.<p>Willing to consider remote applicants only if they can commit to at least 1-2 days/week in London in a normal week.<p>To apply: email founders@arachnys.com to introduce yourself and your Github profile (or some other code you've authored or contributed to).","time":1370107576,"type":"comment"}
