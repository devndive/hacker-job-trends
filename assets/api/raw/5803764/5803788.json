H1B okay.<p>AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the currency markets.<p>We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything. We\ndesign and implement our own trading strategies and infrastructure,\ndown to the networking code that ties us in to financial markets. We\nare a very small team (I am the only employee) and are looking to add\none or two engineers who will focus on strategy or on infrastructure.<p>No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However,\nyou do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be\nable to implement your strategies carefully in C++.<p>An example of a project that a member of our infrastructure team could work on is a system for logging to non-volatile memory.  We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data.  NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss.  Hardware like this has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters.  Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable.  This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis.  Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more.  If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.<p>For more details go to <a href=\"http://amacapital.net/careers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://amacapital.net/careers.html</a>","time":1370091953,"type":"comment"}
