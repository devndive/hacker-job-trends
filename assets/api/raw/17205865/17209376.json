Our mission is to help a company understand what they need to focus on to drive retention and revenue, and quickly.<p>We’re tackling the challenge companies face getting feedback from customers, and have built a beautifully simple, no-effort-required solution that delivers micro-surveys via the product itself to samples of its users.<p>Our platform analyzes the responses with machine learning and is able to deliver actionable insights to help our customers grow their business. It&#x27;s a fully automated solution and can answer some of the toughest questions SaaS companies are facing, such as how to capture more signups or reduce churn.<p>We are signing more customers than our product can handle, just closed a seed round and now looking to grow the engineering team to keep up with demand.<p>Previously I was an early employee at five successfully acquired companies (including Weebly ($365M) and Vurb ($115M)) so I’m excited to make the sixth exit as a Founder this time.<p>Interested?
