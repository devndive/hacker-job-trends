We’re a bootstrapped, profitable company launched in March of 2012. We are a remote company based in Los Angeles but have a worldwide team (Canada, Europe, Armenia to name a few).<p>We’re looking for a senior, full stack developer, preferably with Perl experience, to help us advance our mission by: building new webservices to integrate with other SaaS solutions, and building and supporting our CourtAPI solution.<p>Testimonial from a team member: “Long story, but I worked there for maybe 6ish months part time a while back. They offered me full time, but I ended up going to a startup because I wanted to learn some specific technologies + up my skills in Data Science. That job was definitely good for some people, but it wasn’t as remote as they advertised it (had me fly in alot), and the team was somewhat difficult to work with ;) I ended up starting my own consulting and at the same time CourtDrive reached back out to me (perfect timing). Point I was trying to make was that I went back to work with them because they were so nice to work with. Not super demanding and very open to listening to ideas&#x2F;suggestions - just a pleasant environment.”<p>Full job listing and specific skills we are looking for: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1-Ffwezl2D76eFT_X9qnNMU51Ti7b74g9dKEQl1-8sPI&#x2F;edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1-Ffwezl2D76eFT_X9qnNMU51...</a>","time":1527870414,"type":"comment"}
