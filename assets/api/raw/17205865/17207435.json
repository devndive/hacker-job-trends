He seemed obsessed with MongoDB migrations and upset I hadn&#x27;t done any.<p>I realize it prob wasn&#x27;t you and it&#x27;s up the hiring manager but ghosting is unprofessional, IMHO. If I&#x27;m going to take time to pass a technical test and have 2 hour-long phone call interviews, at least e-mail me later to say no thanks.","time":1527872530,"type":"comment"}
