We&#x27;re working in a number of sectors including production lines, nuclear, agriculture and steel-making in collaboration with other companies and universities. The company is growing year-on-year and we&#x27;re looking to expand. The team collectively has decades of expertise in optics so this is a great opportunity to learn, as well as teach us what you know!<p>We&#x27;re hiring for a software engineer who is familiar with robotics. Specifically you should have experience with ROS and C++. We also use Python for day to day scripting. Bonus points if your background is computer vision, particularly for mapping. This job would really suit someone with a hacker mentality who enjoys tinkering with stuff. We have a lot of cool toys in our lab (thermal cameras, spectrometers,3D printer,lots and lots lasers...).<p>You will be working on software to interface cameras with other robotic systems e.g. arms or rovers. This includes general product and IP development as well as developing custom vision systems for clients.<p>The work is variable and interesting and there is scope to focus on projects that match your expertise. Some experience with hardware would be useful (eg basic electronics or CAD), but not necessary.<p>Any questions, please email jveitch@i3drobotics.com or nbantin@i3drobotics.com","time":1527877227,"type":"comment"}
