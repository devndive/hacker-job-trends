Our current focus is the development and deployment of the Lightning Network[1], an open blockchain scalability protocol[2] primarily being developed for Bitcoin. Lightning allows for high volume, low fee, instant payments on top of Bitcoin. We strive to continually push the edge of innovation w.r.t blockchain scalability, advanced privacy-preserving smart contracts, and cryptocurrency UX. Amongst our team include applied cryptographers, the designers of the Lightning Network protocol, and several Bitcoin developers making key contributions to the open source Bitcoin eco-system such as roasbeef[3].<p>{Cryto Protocol Engineer || Distributed Systems Engineer}:<p>We&#x27;re looking for an experienced software engineer well versed in applied cryptography, peer to peer networks, distributed systems, open source software collaboration, and cryptocurrencies. Your job description would include working on lnd[4] the most feature-complete implementation of the Lightning Network, neutrino[5] an advanced lite client operating mode for Bitcoin, conduct novel research into cryptocurrencies (and related areas), and helping to design the next generation of smart contract applications on Bitcoin.<p>{Frontend Developer}:<p>Our work on the second-layer of blockchains presents a number of UI&#x2F;UX challenges as we lift traditional wallets to the next layer creating a new application platform on top Lightning. As a result, we&#x27;re also looking for a frontend developer to build out the key applications, libraries, and tools for the masses to interact with Lightning. Our applications are built on React, React-Native, MobX and Electron, communicating with a Lightning daemon over a binary RPC protocol. Ideal applicants have experience building+shipping React-Native applications, and have also have experience maintaining open source projects.<p>You can contact me directly at jobs@lightning.engineering with some, or all of the following: link to your github account, resume, a brief cover letter detailing your past experience in the areas listed above, and some relevant work you&#x27;ve done.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lightning.network&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lightning.network&#x2F;</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lightningnetwork&#x2F;lightning-rfc&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lightningnetwork&#x2F;lightning-rfc&#x2F;</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;roasbeef&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;roasbeef&#x2F;</a>, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;roasbeef\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;roasbeef</a><p>[4]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lightningnetwork&#x2F;lnd&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lightningnetwork&#x2F;lnd&#x2F;</a><p>[5]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lightninglabs&#x2F;neutrino\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lightninglabs&#x2F;neutrino</a>","time":1527884199,"type":"comment"}
