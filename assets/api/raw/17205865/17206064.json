This includes the classification of researchers and physicians to their scholarly research, predicting the altruistic activities of donors to non-for-profit foundations, and much more.<p>We&#x27;re growing fast in a field that is also growing fast, so we&#x27;re looking for people who want to grow fast too.  We think an environment that is supportive, collaborative, and sophisticated is the key to making this happen.<p>We&#x27;re working with technologies like Python, Scala, Spark, React, Docker, Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, and Terraform, and we&#x27;re experimenting with many more.  Our data science group is math-focused and loves deep learning, Bayesian modeling, but also good old-fashioned regression.<p>If creating foundational infrastructure in data science using the latest tools and techniques sounds appealing, we&#x27;d love to start a conversation.
