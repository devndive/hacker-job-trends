Check us out at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;springshare.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;springshare.com</a>. We’ve been around since 2007. Our target market is small so we’ll never go public and we won’t promise you equity worth millions on paper. Come and help us grow – slow but steady. In return we offer a great and supportive small team environment where your work will definitely have a big impact, competitive salary and full benefits, a steady job, and that great feeling that your work matters because it is improving the worlds’ libraries and schools (we are international, with client institutions in 80 countries).<p>We’re looking for a full stack intermediate&#x2F;senior software engineer. Our tech stack is LNMP and Angular so you must have 5+ years of professional experience with current knowledge of PHP or Angular, or both. Experience in OOP&#x2F;MVC concepts is a must, too.<p>We’re also looking for a product manager with 3+ years of PM experience, to manage one or two products with each product having 2-3 developers working on it. PM is not purely technical position but working knowledge of concepts of web technologies is required.  We’re agile&#x2F;scrum shop.<p>You must be comfortable – and highly productive – working remotely. We do have an office in NYC but everyone else works remotely. We’d prefer if you live in one of these states - NY, CA, FL, PA, MA, or KY. If you’re international, the working hours must overlap significantly with US working hours.<p>Send us your resume at jobs@springshare.com or contact me personally (I’m the founder&#x2F;owner) at slaven@","time":1527869879,"type":"comment"}
