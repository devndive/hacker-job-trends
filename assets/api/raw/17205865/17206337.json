The full team is remote, so you won&#x27;t be missing out on in-office conversations.  Work weeks are 40 hours, and we generally try to have people overlap 10am-4pm EST.<p>Journeyman Dev:<p><pre><code>  - develop backend and endpoint applications for security compliance, risk scoring, authentication, etc.\n  - strong in python, perl, ruby, or PHP\n  - experience with a second language (others within that list, or C, Java, Clojure, etc.)\n  - good Linux&#x2F;Unix skills (command line, scripting, etc.)\n  - recommended&#x2F;beneficial experience: relational DBs, security, and networking\n  - requires a DoD 8570 baseline certification: Security+ (can be obtained prior to your start date) or CISSP\n</code></pre>\nSenior SysAdmin:<p><pre><code>  - lead a small team of sysadmins, including delegating tasks\n  - manage a multi-site enclave of virtualized Linux servers\n  - maintain system security per DoD policy and best practices\n  - knowledge of networking protocols, system hardening, and virtualized environments\n  - experience with a configuration management tool (puppet, chef, ansible, etc.) and RHEL&#x2F;CentOS (packaging, services, etc.)\n  - requires DoD 8570 baseline certifications: either Security+ or CISSP, and Linux+ or RHSA\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t have salary ranges for either position at the moment, but if I had to throw out a ballpark figure I&#x27;d guess 90k for the dev position, and 115k for the sysadmin position.  But again, those are guesses on my part.<p>Please email parsonsremote@gmail.com to get in touch.","time":1527867537,"type":"comment"}
