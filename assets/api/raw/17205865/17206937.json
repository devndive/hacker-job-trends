Avoiding the traditional approach to architecting systems in-house and instead embracing the future of building a highly scalable and secure web application built upon the emerging PaaS providers quickly turned the original vision of disrupting the SEC market into a reality.  Today Workiva’s solution Wdesk is being used by thousands of companies globally, including over 70% of the 500 largest U.S. corporations by total revenue. Workiva’s vision is reaching into new and larger markets with the same original goal of disruption, building a platform that will continue to revolutionize the way businesses operate and collaborate.<p>Our Stack:<p><pre><code>  *Java&#x2F;Python&#x2F;Dart&#x2F;Go\n\n  *MySql&#x2F;BigQuery&#x2F;Datastore&#x2F;GraphDB\n\n  *Vessel and Nats messaging bus\n\n  *Google App Engine, AWS and Docker for application deployment, scaling and service management.\n</code></pre>\nWe’re hiring:<p><pre><code>  * Software Engineers\n\n  * Senior Software Engineers\n\n  * Site Reliability Engineers\n\n  * Software Development Engineers in Test\n</code></pre>\nCheck out our careers page to learn more: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workiva.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workiva.com&#x2F;careers</a>","time":1527870226,"type":"comment"}
