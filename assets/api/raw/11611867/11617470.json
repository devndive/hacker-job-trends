Currently, we are focused on visual perception problems, like recognition, segmentation, and scene parsing. We are interested in general solutions that work well across multiple sensory domains and tasks.<p>Using inductive biases drawn from neuroscience, our system requires orders of magnitude less training data than traditional machine learning techniques. Our underlying framework combines advantages of deep architectures and generative probabilistic models. We use modern software engineering practices, and we strive to maintain a codebase and a culture that are a joy to work in.<p>We have raised ~$70M in funding and are not constrained by publication, grant applications, or product development cycles. At Vicarious, there is room to develop new approaches that would otherwise not be supported in academia or industry.<p>The Vicarious team leverages progress in machine learning and computer vision communities, and we are always looking for exceptional researchers to join our team.<p>Interested?
