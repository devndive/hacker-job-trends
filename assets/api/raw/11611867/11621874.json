Are you an engineer or scientist that colors outside the lines and isnâ€™t afraid to do so? Synthego is turning molecular biology into an information science. We&#x27;re building hardware facilities that abstract biological syntheses and research into software.<p>The vision is that biologists won&#x27;t need their own labs anymore - they&#x27;ll go to a website. \nInstead of doing manual labor, they&#x27;ll write code.<p>We are looking for people who want to help build our fully-automated facility (hardware and software). We just launched our first product: a CRISPR Kit for scientist!<p>* Mechanical&#x2F;Mechatronics Engineers | <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;synthego.recruiterbox.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;fk06qal&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;synthego.recruiterbox.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;fk06qal&#x2F;</a><p>* Frontend Engineer | Do you have JavaScript and Angular Ninja skills?<p>* Junior Mechanical Technicians<p>* Automation Engineers<p>* Roboticists<p>* Organic Chemists<p>* Wet lab technicians (must have chemistry or biochemistry lab experience)<p>* Biologist experienced (must have CRISPR experience)<p>We are backed by Founders Fund (the Peter Thiel crew), and Menlo Ventures.
