About 70% of our code is Haskell but we&#x27;re also using TypeScript, Scala, C# and Objective-C (moving to Swift) for web- and native mobile clients. If you&#x27;ve got strong frontend skills (web or iOS development) and like functional programming you&#x27;d probably also be a perfect match for our team. Please note that unfortunately we can only hire German speakers at the moment because we have not entered the international market (yet).
