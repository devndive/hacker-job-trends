This is your opportunity to get involved in a dynamic San Francisco-based startup with major growth potential.<p>Kentik Technologies is the creator of Kentik Detect, a big data-based SaaS for network visibility, DDoS detection, and infrastructure optimization. Accessible via portal, psql client, and API, Kentik Detect is the network visibility solution that our founders — former network operators from Akamai, Netflix, YouTube, and CloudFlare — always wanted but could never find. It lets network operators see complete traffic paths, find root causes for link congestion, reduce costs by peering with other networks, and know immediately when their networks are under DDoS attack. Our customer list includes Shopify, Pandora, DailyMotion, Yelp, Box, Neustar, and OpenDNS. And with your help we can keep making it even better.<p>On the backend we&#x27;re looking for folks with real-world experience building distributed systems in Go&#x2F;C&#x2F;C++. On the front end we need experts at both client- and server-side JavaScript, with broad experience in monitoring, visualization, and building state-of-the-art Web applications. And in sales we need proven performers with a track record in highly technical markets (network-related preferred).<p>Sound like a good fit?
