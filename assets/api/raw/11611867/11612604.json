Our mission is to exponentially lower the cost required to film sports at the youth, high school and D2&#x2F;D3 college levels to make it easy for coaches and parents to film and live-stream games.   But we won&#x27;t stop there. We want to make the programmatic viewing experience better than the manual one, complete with automatic highlights and editing.  To that end, we&#x27;re building a cost-effective, computer vision powered unmanned camera designed to intelligently film and live stream any sporting event.<p>Roles:<p>-- Lead Backend Engineer | 100K - 115K | 0.5% - 1.5%<p>-- Lead Computer Vision Engineer | 100K - 115K | 0.5% - 1.5%<p>If interested, reach out to engineering@fieldvision.co or contact us on Angelist","time":1462205128,"type":"comment"}
