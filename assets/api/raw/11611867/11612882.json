Since 2011 we&#x27;ve been focused on simplifying Direct Debit for small and medium companies (who previously had no access to it) and we&#x27;re now expanding to serve the largest companies (think newspapers, utilities) and connect with existing payment systems in countries all over the world. We already support the UK and Europe and are aiming to expand to more countries over the next year.<p>As an engineering team at GoCardless we care most about stable, reliable, understandable code. We rely on testing and code review and a culture of frequent constructive feedback. We define and manage our own roadmap and run projects in whatever way works best for us.<p>Our stack: Rails, Angular, Postgres, Elasticsearch, Docker, Chef.\nWe also have a bit of Go and Python knocking around.<p>We love learning new things and contributing back to the community. We open source everything we can and regularly host meetups and hackathons at our office in Angel. We have a weekly bookclub within the team and give internal (and external) talks about things that interest us.<p>Interview process: a couple of phone screens, one take home test, one onsite interview (pair programming and some chats - no whiteboards)<p>More info: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gocardless.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gocardless.com&#x2F;jobs</a>.<p>If you&#x27;ve got any questions, let me know (email&#x27;s in my profile).","time":1462206614,"type":"comment"}
