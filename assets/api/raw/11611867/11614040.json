Founder has a demonstrably strong track record in perhaps the most competitive quantitative field there is, and, in his new field, he expects to win.  Hours will be longer than you would work elsewhere, and, for a period, cash pay, while sufficient, will be lower than you could get elsewhere.  Equity percentage, meaning, control, responsibility, opportunity, learning, and power will all be much better than you could get elsewhere.<p>You would be working from a small office in Lincoln Park, right by the zoo and park.<p>Looking for a winner.  Someone with high standards, high ambition, and the judgement to know what’s important and what’s not.  Track record and attitude much more important than pedigree.  The more experience building world-class software the better, but junior candidates will also be considered.<p>Technologies:  Java, Kotlin, Swift, a bit of JavaScript, and AWS.<p>Email resume and&#x2F;or github profile to austin@jupiter.ai.  Next step is phone screen and then an interview at office.","time":1462213447,"type":"comment"}
