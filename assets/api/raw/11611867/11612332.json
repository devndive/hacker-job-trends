(We&#x27;re happy to have you relocate, but we don&#x27;t offer relocation assistance. We also don&#x27;t do visa sponsorship.)<p>If you read the posting &lt;<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitly.com&#x2F;sproutinfosecjob&gt;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitly.com&#x2F;sproutinfosecjob&gt;</a> you&#x27;ll find that we&#x27;re looking for a pretty well rounded (and at least somewhat experienced) security professional with a diverse skill set. Here&#x27;s a sampling of the kinds of things that you&#x27;ll be asked to help with:<p>* Vulnerability Scanning<p>* Basic Web App pen testing<p>* Security education&#x2F;training<p>* Security code review (Python&#x2F;Java&#x2F;JavaScript&#x2F;PHP&#x2F;ObjC&#x2F;Swift)<p>* Policy drafting<p>* IDS<p>* Log management&#x2F;SIEM<p>* Network design<p>* Incident Response<p>* and more...<p>This is a small enough security group that if it is related to security, you will probably touch it at some point. If that kind of experience sounds like fun, send us an application (again, &lt;<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitly.com&#x2F;sproutinfosecjob&gt;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitly.com&#x2F;sproutinfosecjob&gt;</a>).<p>If you have questions about the job, you can email me at bob@..., but please don&#x27;t send me applications or resumes. (I&#x27;m in security, not recruiting.) Those go to the apply link (see above).","time":1462203613,"type":"comment"}
