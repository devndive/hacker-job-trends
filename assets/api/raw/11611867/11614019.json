In simple terms it&#x27;s a petri dish with electrodes that read electricity from living cells. Uses in research, drug discovery, personalized medicine and finding treatments for all kinds of diseases (ice-bucket challenge!).<p>We need a developer and a quality engineer. Our development is a mix of embedded firmware and C# desktop application for Windows. The QA role would focus on automating as much of our testing a possible (regression, data validation, performance, etc...) so that the team as a whole can move faster.<p>For both positions, ideally 1-3 years of experience in C# and Python but similar languages &amp; skills are ok.<p>If you&#x27;re interested: careers@axion-biosystems.com","time":1462213342,"type":"comment"}
