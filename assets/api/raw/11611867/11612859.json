If you are someone who places equal emphasis on writing correct code and shipping things, we might be the right place for you.<p><i></i>Interview Process<i></i>: We will never ask you to write a Binary Search Tree during an interview. We typically do a phone screen followed by an optional coding-assignment (take home). The onsite-interview process is around 4 hours including a lunch and 3 interviews; 2 of these are usually hands-on coding rounds where we let you code on restricted real-world problem (in a language and editor of your choice). The entire process takes around a week from the date of application.<p>We also do a lot of open source stuff.
