These applications are built on our technology stack, consisting of a node web service backend, which streams analysis results via websockets to the web applications, where results are visualized using D3. The successful applicant will be involved in further developing the iobio framework (client libraries and server), designing and building new web apps, and creating new visualizations.<p>For backend engineers we are looking to create systems that will analyze huge amounts of genomic data, support the visualization and collaboration needs of our web apps, and provide a robust API for data visualization. We are built on AWS and are looking to leverage the cloud wherever possible, but will most likely require traditional server setups for clients with sensitive patient data. The successful applicant will be involved in both designing and building these systems. Remuneration will include both a competitive salary and stock in Frameshift Genomics.
