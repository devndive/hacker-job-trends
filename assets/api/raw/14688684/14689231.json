We&#x27;re tired of schools being stuck with crappy software that never changes, and we&#x27;re working to bring actual innovation to the space, and solve the hair-on-fire problems fundraisers face.<p>Michael Seibel, CEO of YC, expects us to be a household name in the next few years: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13896296\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13896296</a>.
