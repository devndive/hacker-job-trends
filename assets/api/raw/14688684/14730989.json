It&#x27;s going well - in fact, we&#x27;re already the number one data source for this sort of information. And we&#x27;ve built a clever online platform so that we can share unprecedented amounts of it with our users. They tell us it&#x27;s enormously valuable but, as an ambitious company ourselves, we&#x27;re not done yet. If you&#x27;re a fearless generalist who loves working with Django and Python and doesn&#x27;t mind getting stuck into different problems then this this might well be the job for you.","time":1499624833,"type":"comment"}
