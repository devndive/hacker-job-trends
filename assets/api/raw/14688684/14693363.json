Our mission is to bring massive amounts of joy and efficiency to impact work. We&#x27;re funded by a large client contract with a top intl agency.<p>You&#x27;d be the 4th hire into a team of 3 (family-sized). You&#x27;ll have the time of your life growing this thing. We&#x27;ve started multi-million dollar companies before. Our team rocks, and we&#x27;re low-ego, and mission-focused. Plus, people really want our product. Very really.<p>We need a Sales Animal. We haven&#x27;t solidified titles, but you could morph into the future VP of Sales, a Senior Account Exec, Sales Ops Mgr, Partnership Mgr. At first, you and I are doing it all: cold calling, proposal handing, scheduling, deal closing, etc. This is my focus as well; you won&#x27;t be alone.<p>Experience with $10k+ deals a big plus, but first and foremost, we need (a) smart, (b) animal-ness, (c) and a &quot;James&#x2F;Jill Bond&quot;-like emotional resilience. Be ready for startup life. We&#x27;re early enough to make you rich; but late enough to have validated the biggest risks w&#x2F; a big client and pipeline.<p>Equity, commission, base, and impact.<p>Email me at kyle at (our company) com","time":1499139463,"type":"comment"}
