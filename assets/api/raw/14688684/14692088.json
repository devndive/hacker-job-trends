We are the first automated electronics factory built around a modern tech stack. We help hardware companies producing self driving cars, satellites, 3D printers, robotics, &amp; more to rapidly prototype electronics and get to market faster.<p>Join our growing team to work on a variety of problems across CircuitHub&#x27;s entire stack. No direct experience with factory automation or electronics is necessary but we like curious people willing to learn.<p>Our stack:<p>- Haskell API server using GHC 8, Yesod, Opaleye, and many other libraries from Hackage.<p>- Elm front end.<p>- PostgreSQL for data storage, with querying via Opaleye &amp; Rel8.<p>- AWS &#x2F; Heroku for hosting.<p>- NixOS for development environments, continuous integration and deployments.<p>- Functional reactive programming for standalone GUI applications.<p>- Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and instrumentation.<p>careers@circuithub.com","time":1499122912,"type":"comment"}
