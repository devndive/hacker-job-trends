We&#x27;re based in the Seattle WA metropolitan area.<p>Our application is built on C# with .NET (migrating to core), Javascript, and Jquery.  However, we&#x27;re going to migrate to a frontend framework like angular in the short term.  We are going to work on distributing our application API so there will be room for growth in that direction as well after launch.<p>We have 2 positions open for entry level engineers, but if you are a talented software engineer and want to reach out feel free to email too.  There is room for us to pivot with these positions based on talent.<p>email me at elarge@apolloroboticstechnology.com","time":1499100327,"type":"comment"}
