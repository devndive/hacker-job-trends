While review sites lack authenticity and local credibility, and travel guide books go out of date the moment they’re published, Localeur gives you a real look into what it’s like to be a local. If it’s not local, it’s not on Localeur.<p>Since launching Localeur in 2013, our mission has been to help people experience local wherever they go. We are passionate about helping people feel like they belong and experiencing the true culture of a city, rather than the tourist traps and chains. Quality, authenticity and integrity are paramount to us achieving this mission.<p>We are looking for a great JavaScript developer who is proficient with React.js. Your primary focus will be on developing user interface components and implementing them following well-known React.js workflows (such as Flux or Redux). You will ensure that these components and the overall application are robust and easy to maintain. You will coordinate with the rest of the team working on different layers of the infrastructure. Therefore, a commitment to collaborative problem solving, sophisticated design and quality product is important.<p>Please send any resumes and sample apps to moody@localeur.com","time":1499098252,"type":"comment"}
