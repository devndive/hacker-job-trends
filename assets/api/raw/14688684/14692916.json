We&#x27;re 100% remote.<p>We&#x27;re looking for super talented product designer with a passion for data and web applications to help design and build the next generation of tools for doing useful things with data.<p>Knack is a no-code application platform that enables anyone to easily build business and workflow apps. It&#x27;s a big fun product that creates tons of value.<p>We&#x27;ve spent a lot of time playing feature catch-up and optimizing for product-market fit. We&#x27;re now at the point where we want to focus on product design to truly make Knack special.<p>Other things about us: we&#x27;re 100% bootstrapped, so we know how to build a product customers will pay for.

We don&#x27;t have a VP layer or management, and want to keep it that way as long as we can.<p>Other things about you: you want to join a team that actually enjoys working with each other. You want to be engaged with the product and company beyond just design. You are not afraid of taking ownership and responsibility. You want to maximize your impact.<p>Find out more at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knack.com&#x2F;work-at-knack\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knack.com&#x2F;work-at-knack</a>","time":1499133058,"type":"comment"}
