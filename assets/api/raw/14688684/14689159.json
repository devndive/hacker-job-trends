We run our own stack with ERP5 (Business Suite), SlapOS (Cloud Deployment) and Wendelin (Big Data&#x2F;Machine Learning) being the main solutions for which we provide customization services (our code is free, our time isn&#x27;t). We have time to tinker, need to think out-of-the-box&#x2F;ram&#x2F;space and work mostly autonomous. We all use Chromebooks, our hierarchy is as flat as the area around Lille, our offices are paperless and we have no meetings. We mostly hack in Python and (vanilla) JavaScript. If you&#x27;re looking for fame or gain, we&#x27;re not the right place. For purpose and leverage, we might be worth considering. Join us!","time":1499097232,"type":"comment"}
