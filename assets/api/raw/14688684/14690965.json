Millions of farmers globally don&#x27;t have access to the basic farm tools the rest of the world depends on for food production, good seed and fertilizer. We sell these proven agricultural tools on credit, and use satellite data and ML to figure out who we can lend to profitably.<p>We use Scala, Python&#x2F;NumPy&#x2F;SciPy (for science&#x2F;ML), android and are heavy postgres users. We&#x27;re building great software for places with low reliability networks and harsh environmental conditions.<p>We  delivered fertilizer to ~1000 farmers earlier this March and are now in the process of getting paid back and supporting our farmers this season. As an example of the kind of work you&#x27;d be doing, this week our team is responding to a break out of army worms amongst our farmers by rolling out a  pesticide loan on credit so our farmers can save their crops<p>To apply, send me an email at earl@apolloagriculture.com","time":1499112010,"type":"comment"}
