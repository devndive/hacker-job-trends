You know it makes your service way easier to understand, reduces your churn and even increases signups. But it is just too much manual labor to keep the shots up to date.\nWe are creating a solution to fix this and it is coming along pretty nicely.\nOur stack includes PHP, Python, VueJS, MySQL, Docker, Selenium, Browser Extensions, Bugs, Performance Issues and a sense of humor.<p>If you have any questions or you are interested - Please reach out to me arjen@cliperado.com","time":1499103410,"type":"comment"}
