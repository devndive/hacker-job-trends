The service is powered by college students who select work from our job board for part-time income and to start developing a professional track record of success. After testing in small markets last year, we are fully-funded and rebuilding the operations from ground zero. (If you visit our site, you will see the old one.) We are currently housed at the Lamp Post Group (venture incubator) under great mentorship and with a handful of other exciting startups in the beautiful Chattanooga, TN. Chattanooga was the first city in the US to have gigabit Internet.<p>I am the sole developer on the project, and I am looking for a partner to either serve as a strong generalist or take over front-end, back-end, or mobile. Strong sysadmin skills preferred.<p>Please contact me at jason@campusbellhops.com if you are interested.","time":1359732752,"type":"comment"}
