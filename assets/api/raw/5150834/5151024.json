{"by":"andygeers","id":5151024,"parent":5150834,"text":"Hubbub - London or surroundings - Full time<p>Hubbub is saving independent food shops by letting people order online when they can't get to the shops themselves. We mask the complexity of ordering from lots of separate shops and allow customers to place a single order online and receive all their weekly shopping in one go. It's good for the shops because it lets them reach a wider audience, and it's good for our busy customers because it allows them to support their local community.<p>We're looking for two developers, who will double the size of our current team, to work on our Rails based website and supporting applications. Ruby experience is a plus, but we're very happy to take on people without direct experience if they know how to learn - our second developer hadn't written any Ruby before starting with us.\nMore details, including how to apply, are at <a href=\"http://developers.hubbub.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://developers.hubbub.co.uk/</a>","time":1359730788,"type":"comment"}
