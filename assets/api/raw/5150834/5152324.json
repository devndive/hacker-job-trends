Fast. If you're into high-traffic concurrent server-side programming on Linux, our set of problems is fairly unique. We're Python fans, but never forget our C roots.<p>We offer competitive salary, great benefits, challenging problems to work on and smart engineers to eat lunch and have fun with.<p>The projects we're currently working on are not old. You won't be fixing other people's bugs or debug some legacy spaghetti. Our technical debt is at all-time low, and most of what needs to be built needs to be done from scratch. Join us!<p>We're in SOMA, San Francisco. Ping us at jobs@mailgun.com","time":1359742262,"type":"comment"}
