We're highly influenced by Valve's Employee handbook, and the culture at GitHub, Stripe, etc. SF-local employees have catered lunch every day.<p>The frontend is a fat javascript client, using HamlCoffee, Less and Knockout. We have a lot of interesting design and data-visualization problems that need to be solved.<p>The backend is written in Clojure. Backend engineers should know Clojure or another 'weird' language (Haskell, Scala, Scheme, etc), and Linux Devops (C compilation model, make, packaging).<p>Contact us at jobs@circleci.com.
