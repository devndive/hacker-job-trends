PHP experience is a perk but not required.<p>For mobile, we're working on iOS first since 75% of our mobile traffic is iOS based, but if you develop for Android we'd still love to talk to you.<p>Marketplaces pose a lot of interesting technical challenges like working with large and rapidly growing sets of user submitted items, processing large volume transactions, working with image processing and manipulation, developing algorithmic solutions for curation, spam, and fraud, and automating chunks of the logistical backend that runs behind the scenes.<p>As a company we value transparency, sustainability, and customer service. We're relentlessly focused on developing a product people love, and to that end we focus on quantitatively measuring impact of the changes we make to the product, as well as getting constant feedback from our customers.<p>You can reach us through angel list, or contact me direct at sash@tradesy.com<p><a href=\"https://angel.co/tradesy#recruiting\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://angel.co/tradesy#recruiting</a>","time":1359736629,"type":"comment"}
