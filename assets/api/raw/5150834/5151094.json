It's a \"level 3\" engineer job- you'd be taking escalations from the 1st and 2nd tier techs when they weren't able to solve problems themselves; mentoring them on skills they should know; advising clients on the best ways to improve their infrastructure, and implementing solutions to some fun projects (getting those 8 dusty old DL 320's out of someone's rack and onto their very first VMware deployment!)<p>The right candidate will need 3+ years of experience in a helpdesk or service delivery environment; proven skills with Windows servers from 03-08, including Active Directory, Exchange, DNS, DFS, WDS would be cool.. and experience with multiple server environments. Know what a firewall is too- Sonicwall experience would be great!<p>Be a good communicator, superior troubleshooter, able to work under pressure, and really want to be part of a team.<p>I'd love to talk to you more about it if you're interested!
