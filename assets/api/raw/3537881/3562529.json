We’re looking for a talented junior/mid-level Rails developer preferably in the Philly/NYC/DC area, but remotes are welcome as well.<p>Perks:<p>- Work at a well-established small company that’s 5 years old, bootstrapped, profitable, and proud!<p>- Join a tightly-knit small team of very talented coders to help drive the product.<p>- We are very progressive with the technology we use. Chef, kiji-ruby, authlogic, Backbone.js, etc. We implement the things we find promising, and encourage all developers to help bring ideas to the table. Let your voice be heard and your opinion be respected!<p>- Our team is very test- and spec-driven. We typically use a peer-review model to ensure that none of us are going off the deep end with a solution. We are striving towards continuous deployment. We have our CI server run our test suite upon each push to the remote repo. We measure almost everything.<p>- You are encouraged to contribute to open source, and we have open source Fridays!<p>- Relish in the fact that the projects you will be working on will be used directly by thousands of our customers worldwide!<p>- Reimbursement for conferences or meetups you would like to attend, books you want to buy, screencasts you want to watch.<p>- Great benefits package, a competitive salary, and lots of room for growth. Our goal is to ensure you are comfortable so you will be productive.<p>Requirements:<p>- We are looking for a relatively green go-getter who’s chomping at the bit to make a lasting impression and eager to learn new things.<p>- Must have at least a year of experience working directly with ruby, either with a company, or via open source. Past contributions to open source projects, or maintaining your own, are looked very highly upon.<p>- At least a year’s experience working with Rails, either your own or at a previous company.<p>- Experience with jQuery and (double rainbow bonus) Backbone.js.<p>- Solid familiarity with git or other distributed version control system.<p>- Enough SQL to understand what rails is doing in the backend.<p>- A good sense of humor is a strict requirement. Company culture is very important to us, and we are absolutely NOT a bunch of straight-laced, profit-driven, cubicle-sitting curmudgeons.<p>- Remote work OK, but it is highly preferable if you are located around the Philadelphia area. You will be expected to be at our Philadelphia office sometimes. We do get lonely.<p>Check out the site, play with the demo. <a href=\"http://www.pipelinedeals.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.pipelinedeals.com</a><p>Interested?
