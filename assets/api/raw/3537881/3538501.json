Help us invent new products for the modern (mobile) web in our brand-new, dog-friendly SF office.  You'll meaningfully impact product direction, contribute to open source, and hook tons of people up. (Oh, and we're mostly a ruby + coffeescript shop -- all the C++ is in NY.)<p>I started as a developer two months ago, and I'm really enjoying it here: people are positive, and it's a pleasant mix between a startup and established company.  If you have any questions, send em over to drost@okcupidlabs.com and I'll get back to you with a candid response.<p><a href=\"http://jobs.okcupidlabs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jobs.okcupidlabs.com/</a>","time":1328112555,"type":"comment"}
