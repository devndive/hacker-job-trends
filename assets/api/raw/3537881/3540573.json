Real-time collaboration and full versioning history aren't our only advantages; users tell us they like LucidChart because it's faster, easier, and smoother than Visio and Omnigraffle.<p>We need great engineers who want to work in a Silicon Valley startup, but would rather live 15 minutes from the ski resorts in Utah. We have one of the largest Javascript codebases on the Internet supporting LucidChart's client, and are using Scala, PHP, node.js, MongoDB, and MySQL to power our servers. Experience in one or more of these areas is helpful, but we're most interested in people with inhuman problem solving skills.<p>We currently have 9 full-time employees, including 6 engineers. That ratio reflects the focus of our organization -- we are a software company, and we live or die on the strength of our engineering team. We think we have the strongest engineering team in Utah, and want to add at least 3-5 people this year.<p>All hires are made by unanimous decision of the current team. If you join us, you can know that everyone here wants you here.<p>Send resumes, github profiles, or whatever else might be relevant to jobs at lucidchart dot com.","time":1328138127,"type":"comment"}
