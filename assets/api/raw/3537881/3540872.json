It's a large, untapped market, and we are funded by great investors who share our passion: Lightbank (Groupon's original investor) and ffVC (Klout's original investor).<p>We are a team of two (one hacker, one business guy with a CS degree) and we are looking for another hacker. As our first hire, we would consider you a late co-founder and expect as much. You'll get serious product ownership with real equity and a salary. You'll be the third leg of the tripod.<p>We're looking for someone who has built and scaled products on the Ruby / Rails stack in the past. You've probably worked at a startup if not started one. You are smart and relentlessly resourceful. You'll spend most of your time crafting code in Ruby and Javascript, so you should love it. We think hackers should drive product, so you should be comfortable doing this. You've probably at least dabbled in MongoDB and Node.js.<p>We have great shared startup space in the Lower East Side with tons of great food and bar options nearby. In addition to equity and salary, you'll get your choice of equipment and we'll cover 100% of your health benefits, and lunches and dinners while you're working. And of course the fridge will always be stocked with soda and great micro brews.","time":1328143131,"type":"comment"}
