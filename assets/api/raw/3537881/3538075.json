We're a small company with a laid-back atmosphere (we love dogs and cookouts) located right on Union Square, in the heart of the city.<p>We're looking for a back-end engineer to help grow our product. Rather than any buzzwords, we value folks who are passionate about and take pride in their craft. Our back-end stack includes PHP, a bit of C, PostgreSQL, Sphinx and Memcached but we'd welcome inquiries from anyone with experience in designing and writing distributed systems, systems programming, and back-end development in general.<p>Our diverse staff includes veteran engineers from HotJobs and Yahoo, one of Computerworld's 40 Under 40 tech innovators, and even a well-known concert photographer. We offer competitive salaries, stock options, bonuses, great benefits, and try to grab dinner together (on the company!) every few weeks.<p>If you're interested, shoot an e-mail to devjobs@photoshelter.com. Thanks!","time":1328107076,"type":"comment"}
