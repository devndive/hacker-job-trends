We have a nice office and are working on a site with millions of unique visitors a month.<p>The site is growing by double percentage points every month, so we need to hire a few backend engineers to help us refactor the code and to implement some great new features.  The company is very open and is a great place to work.  Your ideas and code will have an impact on how this company grows and launches features.<p>If you would like to find out more here is what we are looking for.<p>Someone who has worked deeply in PHP on at least one project and has worked on a a site at scale with at least one project.  We would prefer if you were the one who brought the site to scale, but it's ok if you learned a lot while you were there.<p>We are also looking for someone that had worked in a test driven development culture, but it's ok if you always wanted to.  We want to be able to release daily and to know that our code is well covered.<p>I am at @jdavid on twitter if you would like to grab coffee or lunch.  We are near the market and california.<p>One of our founders is extremely inspired by how GitHub is able to launch new code.","time":1328127007,"type":"comment"}
