On Academia.edu, academics can upload their papers, tag them with research interests, and distribute them instantly to the News Feeds of everyone following those research interests. On the flip side of this, academics see in their News Feeds in real time all papers that have been uploaded to the site in their research areas.<p>The platform is speeding up the distribution of papers amongst researchers around the world. The goal is for papers to be distributed as quickly within research communities around the world as photos are distributed within friend groups on Facebook.<p>Amongst other technologies, we work with Rails, Redis, MongoDB, Beanstalkd, Varnish, Solr, PostgreSQL, Node.js and Memcached.
