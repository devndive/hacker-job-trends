We're primarily a Rails shop.  Having said that, we do have projects in other languages, and we're more than willing to hire someone smart with no Rails experience and bring them up to speed.<p>Stuff we use:  Ruby, Rails, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Node.js, jQuery, AWS/Scalr/Engine Yard, and more.<p>For open positions and a better idea of what we do, take a look at our job page here: <a href=\"http://vitrue.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://vitrue.com/jobs</a> (don't let the site design dissuade you, we're about to change it).  Not every open position is posted, though, so if you're more of a back-end developer, a configuration management type or similar, we'd still love to hear from you.<p>By far, this has been my favorite job that I've ever had -- the corporate culture is very much open, collaborative, and full of change; I'm surrounded by people smarter than I am; and I'm working on interesting/challenging things.<p>You can either apply through the jobs page I linked, or drop me an email at my user name at vitrue.com with questions/comments/resumes/etc..<p>P.S.: This isn't my main account, for reference.","time":1312217943,"type":"comment"}
