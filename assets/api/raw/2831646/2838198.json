{"by":"hitch22","id":2838198,"parent":2831646,"text":"Palo Alto, CA - Rails Developer (CTO?) (local preferred, but will consider other U.S.)<p>Stealth start-up focused on a consumer finance vertical that's very large like Mint.com's, but distinctly different and, we believe, more interesting / subject to disruption. The initial site/app is nearly completed and we're close to launch. Our non-local lead developer, pursuant to known prior commitment, became CTO at a local (for him) start-up in an unrelated area. We're looking for an experienced rails developer immediately to fill his shoes to take company to launch and beyond.  Ideally, this role would lead to co-founder / CTO role. Looking for very strong rails / jQuery / MySQL expertise, test-driven development style and entrepreneurial instincts. If interested, please inquire at workfor@finpicture.com.","time":1312309923,"type":"comment"}
