Then when the YC Winter 2012 program application starts, we are going to apply for the program. Our goal is if we can have few hundreds (or thousands) users base before going into the program, that would be a great achievement.<p>What we need is someone who is strong in web engineering to help us in technical areas and take it to the next level while we are going to do the testing development of the site, business development, funding, user base, marketing, and opportunities. We are looking for help from the following candidate<p>- Can-do attitude, never give up, and love to solve problems (there is always a solution to every problem)<p>- You will be one of the co founder, we are partners.
