We've got a commitment to open web standards, and have even gone to the extent of making our (unfortunately flash-based) video player programmable using Javascript and styleable with CSS3.<p>Much of our player is open sourced and you can find it on our github page (see: <a href=\"https://github.com/videojuicer/smilkit-as3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/videojuicer/smilkit-as3</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/videojuicer/stylekit-as3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/videojuicer/stylekit-as3</a> in particular).<p>The cool part about our full stack video serving platform is that we've focused on minimalist ReSTful component design, which has given us the flexibility and power to be able to experiment and build new visual experiences.<p>Our video player in particular is a cool piece of tech and in conjunction w/ our platform lets users build custom interactive experiences w/in the player (again w/ JS &#38; CSS3), and deploy them selectively attached to relevant videos.<p>You can ping jobs@videojuicer.com, or hit up Ted Han (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/knowtheory\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://twitter.com/knowtheory</a> ) or Dan Glegg (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/angryamoeba\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://twitter.com/angryamoeba</a> ) for more info.  Our email addresses are also our first names at videojuicer.com.<p>Also, feel free to ask me anything 'bout the job here if you have questions :)","time":1312204449,"type":"comment"}
