We're looking for people who want to work with:<p>* Ruby on Rails (we're the #2 largest rails site, after Twitter)\n* Javascript\n* iOS\n* Machine Learning / Data mining kinds of problems\n* Technical recruiting (yes, we're hiring hackers to do this too!)<p>That said, we care way more about your personality and general hacking skills then what languages you've used so far, so if you haven't used these but want to break into mobile or web development, this could be a good opportunity for you.<p>We're well funded and have a really fun office environment (go-karts + a zipline!). We've got flexible hours, a very flat organizational structure that gives a lot of product ownership to engineers, and a really terrific team.<p>Last week we launched our first iPhone app, called \"Float\", which hopes to make reading a better experience.  If you're a fan of reading apps like Instapaper and Reeder, you're already familiar with what we're doing.
