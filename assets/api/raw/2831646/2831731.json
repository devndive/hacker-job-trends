We have an office in Model Colony. Currently we are 10 people (CEO, CTO, adviser, web designer, 6 content creators), with lots of work to be done and not enough of us to go around.<p>The main thing we need now is a general purpose developer. In the past month or so I've crunched half a TB of data in hadoop, build an html5/canvas app, and build a system for human oracles to properly categorize our data. We use javascript, python/django, and hadoop, though we really don't care if you've never touched any of those technologies.<p>Contact info is in my profile. Send a link to your github (or similar portfolio) if you are interested.","time":1312201092,"type":"comment"}
