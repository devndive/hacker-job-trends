FeeFighters is looking for an enthusiastic intern with good coding chops. Ideally, this intern would be an experienced ruby coder, but we’re willing to work with something who wants to pick up ruby and learn in a fast-paced environment. Make no mistake: this is a chance to work on real projects for one of the best startups in Chicago… getting coffee, moving boxes, or any other bullshit are not part of this offer. Spend your time working with a great team, tackling hard problems, and learning what it takes to be a FeeFighter.<p><a href=\"http://feefighters.com/jobs/kickass-rails-intern/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://feefighters.com/jobs/kickass-rails-intern/</a>","time":1312204728,"type":"comment"}
