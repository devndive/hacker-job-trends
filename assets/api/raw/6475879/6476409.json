Think HTTP&#x2F;DB&#x2F;memcache&#x2F;NAS&#x2F;etc processing times for all the servers in a datacenter, all by passively watching the network.<p>I&#x27;m a software engineer at ExtraHop and here&#x27;s why I love my job:<p>1. The team is amazing and everyone makes a difference. The two founders, Jesse and Raja, designed and built BigIP v9 when they were at F5 Networks before founding ExtraHop, and are still very much involved in engineering. It&#x27;s a great working environment and we have a lot of fun.<p>2. Hard problems at all levels. We parse a bunch of different protocols at 20Gbps by writing high-performance multithreaded C and our own linux kernel drivers. Our datastore handles 200,000 inserts a second with 10MB&#x2F;s of data. Our UI has a ton of charts and tables, with data going through django and tornado. We use python, C, javascript, flex (slowly moving to a new UI with html5 + javascript), and a modified yacc+bison for some of our protocol parsers. You can hack anything from C to the front-end design and anywhere in between.<p>3. Our customers love it. It&#x27;s awesome to see problems diagnosed and solved with our box.<p>jobs@extrahop.com<p><a href=\"http://www.extrahop.com/company/jobs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.extrahop.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a>","time":1380637967,"type":"comment"}
