The status quo is full of siloed data that can only be accessed via outdated web applications which allow their users to download disjointed Excel reports.  Rentlytics changes all of this by bringing their data into one place, enabling the asset management team to make better decisions with our analysis tools.<p>Today, our software provides trend analysis tools to let users discover previously unseen spikes in their utilities, apartment refinishing costs, marketing spend, or any of the 250 other data points we track for each apartment.  We need you to come help us build tools that help our users perform complex analysis with the click of a button.<p>My co-founder Justin was a partner at a private equity firm that invested into apartments across the USA.  It is from his frustrations there that our product was born.  I built a few large social media analytics tools, mobile games, and a number of analytics tools for other industries.  Our engineering team is 3 people right now, we would like to add 2 more people by January 2014.<p>We use Python&#x2F;Django for our backend, and Coffeescript with Backbone&#x2F;Marionette for the frontend application.  Experience using these would be great, but is not required.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in changing an industry, then we should chat: phil@rentlytics.com","time":1380649084,"type":"comment"}
