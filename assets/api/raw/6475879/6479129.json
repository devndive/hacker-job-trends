It&#x27;s a fun product to work on that gets a lot of usage, and a fun team to work with. I&#x27;ve also watched the engineering culture in the team really develop in my short stay. All the engineers are happy here.<p>Things around here are starting to move really quickly - we&#x27;re working hard on new products and ramping up our hiring. It&#x27;s an exciting place to be right now, I&#x27;m very happy I decided to stick around for a while.<p>You can email me at artur@codecademy.com if you have any questions.","time":1380662135,"type":"comment"}
