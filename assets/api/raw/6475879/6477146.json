Over 160,000 students in more than 190 countries enrolled. Since then, we&#x27;re grown to offer classes in everything from web development (taught by Steve Huffman, one of Reddit&#x27;s cofounders) to cryptography, biology, design, entrepreneurship (taught by Steve Blank), and more.<p>We make all of our own classes, and we&#x27;re trying to fundamentally change how people think about learning. To see our full class lineup, visit <a href=\"http://www.udacity.com/courses\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.udacity.com&#x2F;courses</a><p>We&#x27;re looking for amazing f&#x2F;t engineers (front-end, back-end, and full-stack) to help us in our quest to revolutionize higher education.
