We just crossed 1 million users and are on a $2m annual revenue run rate. There are some super interesting challenges ahead to scale Buffer as we start to focus on Buffer for business.<p>We&#x27;re looking to expand our engineering team with the following open positions.<p>* DevOps Engineer<p>* Backend Engineer<p>* Front-end Engineer<p>Here are some key stats about our technology and scale.<p><pre><code>    - we have over 150k monthly active users.\n    - 6700+ API clients. Most popular: Feedly, IFTTT, Pocket, Zapier\n    - we release changes several times a day\n    - we have an entirely data-driven process, with Einstein and Buffer-Metrics, our custom built a&#x2F;b testing and metrics tracking framework.\n    - Some of the tech we work with: PHP, Python, MongoDB, AWS (Elastic Beanstalk&#x2F;Auto scaling, Elasticache, SQS), Backbone.js, Grunt.js, Android, iOS.</code></pre>\nMore stats and stack insights here: <a href=\"http://overflow.bufferapp.com/2013/08/01/scaling-buffer-in-2013/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;overflow.bufferapp.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;08&#x2F;01&#x2F;scaling-buffer-in-2...</a><p>We&#x27;re a small team of driven hackers and happiness heroes (our support people). Just like you, we&#x27;re excited and passionate about engineering challenges and have some interesting architecture and scaling problems we work on.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in coming on board, you will:<p><pre><code>    - work closely myself on technical architecture and Joel on product.\n    - ship to hundreds of thousands of people who use Buffer and iterate quickly\n    - work with our metrics team to make smart changes\n    - be friendly and comfortable talking directly to customers on issues and features\n    - be a happy, positive-minded and kind person who has a great approach in dealing with others\n    - be a Buffer user \n    - be anywhere in the world, and if you&#x27;d like, you&#x27;ll have help and support from us to move to where you want to be\n    - have experience working with another startup or building side projects before (would be awesome, it’s cool if not)\n</code></pre>\nSome aspects of Buffer culture that makes us a little different:<p><pre><code>    - we are entirely transparent. We raised $450k, we currently have 1 million users and generate $175k&#x2F;mo. Ask me anything else!\n    - within the company, all salaries and equity are open and we have a formula for the distribution.\n    - we&#x27;re all very focused on self improvement - we have daily standups where we discuss our current improvements. This could be waking up earlier, starting public speaking, blogging, exercise, learning a language, etc.\n    - here&#x27;s our culture deck: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slideshare.net&#x2F;bufferapp&#x2F;buffer-culture-03\n</code></pre>\nSalary: 88k-110k depending on location (living costs) and experience.
