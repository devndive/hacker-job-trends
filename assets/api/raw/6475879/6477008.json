As knowledge workers, we and our loved ones spend most of our time living in programs (email, calendar, document editors, etc.) that help us move and manage data, and get things done. This is an opportunity to improve that part of our lives.<p>Our founders Dustin and JR started Asana after they saw some internal tools they prototyped at Facebook spread through the company and substantially boost teams&#x27; productivity. Since our launch, we&#x27;ve seen tremendously positive response from both press and users.<p>We&#x27;ve also built some pretty breakthrough web technologies ( <a href=\"http://asana.com/luna\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;asana.com&#x2F;luna</a> ), assembled a best-of-the-best engineering team (including creators of Facebook&#x27;s News Feed backend, Android&#x27;s sync, Yelp&#x27;s ranking algorithm, Aptana&#x27;s VP Eng, ...), raised $38M in funding (from Benchmark Capital, Marc Andreessen, Peter Thiel, Mitch Kapor, and Sean Parker), built a mature egoless culture, and perhaps most importantly, are earnestly pursuing a vision and opportunity that we believe has great potential for large positive world impact.<p>See what it&#x27;s like to work at Asana here: <a href=\"http://qr.ae/IQgg6\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;qr.ae&#x2F;IQgg6</a> and more info on our jobs page: <a href=\"http://asana.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;asana.com&#x2F;jobs</a><p>Interested?
