Or your wallet gets stolen.<p>What&#x27;s worse than that is that our competitors are pushing users towards paying with options that are cheaper for the bill providers! We believe you should be able to pay ANY bill with any method you choose.<p>So we&#x27;re making it dead simple to put your mortgage on your credit card and get Amex points for that, your kids&#x27; preschool and anything else that you regularly pay.<p>On top of that we&#x27;re alerting users to fraudulent charges by scanning every line item of all your bills for anomalies and alerting our users to them.<p>It&#x27;s a tough challenge, banks and bill providers don&#x27;t have API&#x27;s and in the last three months we&#x27;ve built the technology to be a more full featured version of Yodlee or Intuit&#x27;s partner program all in house, so our overhead is low, our hopes are high and we&#x27;re looking for some great people to make paying bills suck so much less.<p>We&#x27;re hiring for:<p>Backend Engineer: Coffeescript and Ruby - We&#x27;ve built two seperate applications. One uses almost entirely coffeescript the other is a rails application<p>Designer&#x2F;Frontend: You should be able to at least understand enough haml&#x2F;erb to implement features in the frontend without hand holding<p>If you&#x27;re interested get in touch at jobs [at] cloudbill.com","time":1380641019,"type":"comment"}
