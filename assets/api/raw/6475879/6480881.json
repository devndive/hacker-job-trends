Looking for a frontend designer.<p>We make an analytics and visualization platform for natural language text.<p>Luminoso can quantify the things you&#x27;re looking for in a text dataset, and also lets you explore to find the things you didn&#x27;t know you were looking for. It learns from text in your domain, but it doesn&#x27;t have to learn from scratch: it starts out knowing what words mean, in many languages, based on ConceptNet (<a href=\"http://conceptnet.media.mit.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;conceptnet.media.mit.edu</a>).<p>As a frontend designer, you&#x27;d help us with visual design and user experience, to make it easy for people to upload their text data and get insights from it. This position focuses on design but interacts with the frontend code, so you should be interested in learning (or already know) CoffeeScript and knockout.js.","time":1380692989,"type":"comment"}
