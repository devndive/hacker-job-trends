We&#x27;re currently seeing ~80mm page views&#x2F;month and 34% daily actives across 3 platforms (web, iOS, Android). In case you&#x27;re not familiar with metrics, these are insane numbers. CEO has successfully built&#x2F;sold startups in the past. We&#x27;re also VC funded.<p>Our team consists of 14, mostly technical, guys and gals. We have offices in Toronto and Montreal.<p>We only hire extremely talented, smart, nice people we&#x27;d want to hang out with. Our team of engineers is unanimous: this is the best, most talented team they&#x27;ve ever worked with. And we want to keep improving it!<p>These are the key positions we&#x27;re looking to fill right now:<p>* Senior Android Engineer - Our Android app is still new and constantly growing in popularity. \n* Intermediate&#x2F;Senior iOS engineer - Half our traffic comes from iOS!\n* Interactive Designer (UI&#x2F;UX designer) - looking for someone who can design fun and catchy stuff rather than corporate and boring. Everything design&#x2F;branding-wise needs to be done. We&#x27;re running on Bootstrap right now and we&#x27;re not so proud of it. ;-)<p>These positions are open in either Toronto or Montreal. We&#x27;d love to chat with you to see if there&#x27;s a fit. Please reach out by email at jobs@codified.co .<p>Thanks!","time":1380677385,"type":"comment"}
