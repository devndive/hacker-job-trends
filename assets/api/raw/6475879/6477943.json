We&#x27;ll need to optimize regression, graph, and dozens of other statistical algorithms to efficiently handle wildly diverse datasets. Those analyses will sit on a robust data-handling system that finishes analyses before our users even know they need them. And Statwing&#x27;s deep interaction and data exploration needs to feel like it&#x27;s happening locally even when it&#x27;s not.<p>The ideal candidate:<p>. Excited about taking responsibility and ownership over big pieces of the product<p>. Comfortable with efficiently handling and processing relatively large amounts of data.<p>. Interested in data analysis.<p>. Very comfortable with Python. Some experience with Clojure is a bonus.<p>. An extremely talented programmer, skilled in dealing with performance tradeoffs and bottlenecks.<p>. Deeply concerned with system reliability, code quality, and back end architecture.<p>. Open to asking for help, taking feedback, collaborating, and generally being a team player.<p>. Humor. Has a sense of it.","time":1380650779,"type":"comment"}
