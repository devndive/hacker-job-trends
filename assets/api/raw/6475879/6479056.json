We&#x27;re looking for someone to take over the development of our website and related back office tools. You would be a one man show working closely with our Operations Manager and have lots of control with respect to scheduling and the technologies we use. Our existing contractors are HN readers (they&#x27;re the ones helping us make this post). We&#x27;re looking to take someone on full time. They&#x27;ve used modern tools&#x2F;frameworks and kept the code base in good order. The point is this: you&#x27;ll be taking over a well maintained project... not walking into a nightmare.<p>We think this is a good opportunity for someone who would like to work solo but also be secure in a full-time position.<p><a href=\"https://pacglobalins.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pacglobalins.com</a><p><a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/40899/full-stack-ruby-on-rails-developer-in-la-pac-global-insurance?a=NSABMoX6&amp;searchTerm=rails\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;40899&#x2F;full-stack-ruby-...</a><p>jobs@pacglobalins.com","time":1380661150,"type":"comment"}
