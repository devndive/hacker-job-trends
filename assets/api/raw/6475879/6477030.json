As a result, we&#x27;re looking to expand our engineering team. We are looking for full-stack engineers and senior engineers, especially focused on our backend analytics technology.<p>You&#x27;d be joining the company at a great time. Our engineering team is still small enough that we all fit in a room, but unlike two years ago, we are making millions in revenue and have a ridiculous amount of data to draw insight out of on behalf of our customers.<p>You should be an expert in a mainstream programming language, preferably Python or JavaScript. You should be willing to learn, or already know, technologies like Fabric, Chef, Tornado, MongoDB, Redis, Solr, Cassandra, Pig, Storm, and Amazon Web Services. You should be extremely handy at a UNIX command line, possessing all the skills of a sysadmin.<p>If you join us, you&#x27;ll be part of a well-funded and high-revenue SaaS analytics company that is rewriting the rules of online media. Our software aggregates data on over 5 billion pageviews per month of traffic, and we work with major media companies as customers, such as The Atlantic, Arstechnica, Mashable, The New Republic, MIT Technology Review, and many more.<p>Get in touch with us directly at hello@parsely.com if you are interested -- mention HN and ask for Andrew.","time":1380643612,"type":"comment"}
