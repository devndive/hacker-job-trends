We&#x27;re looking for Python, C++ and Verilog hackers. A definite plus if you think the X86&#x2F;ARM duopoly is boring and would like to work on more interesting architectures. Also a plus if you&#x27;re a hardware guy or gal and have shipped asics and know about power optimization flows.<p>The fridge is always stocked with beer (selected by our resident beer geeks), competitive salaries, free gym. Sane and flexible working hours, 6 weeks of vacation that we actually expect you to use.<p>Contact me (HN username at gmail) if you want to have a chat about how things are here.","time":1380639853,"type":"comment"}
