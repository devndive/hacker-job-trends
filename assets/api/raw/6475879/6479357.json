We want to find a new way for children to learn about the world around them using something that looks like a TV app on the iPad but is way smarter, more interactive and enjoyable.<p>Our product is currently in pre-alpha stage and is planned for a limited release this Christmas. Of engineers working on the product, one person is responsible for the iPad app, three more are working remotely on the Python-based backend. The backend is an elastic video processing system: ffmpeg-based transcoding, dynamic allocation of EC2 instances, tons of supported video inputs, strong focus on the resulting video quality and crazy scalability, all managed via a custom web panel. We&#x27;re looking for another backend expert to join our team. If you&#x27;ll join, you&#x27;ll be the first permanent engineering hire.<p>At the moment we&#x27;re based in Google Campus but will be moving to a new office very soon. Compensation (and equity) is very competitive.<p>Buzzwords: Python, Bottle, ZeroMQ, boto, MongoDB, Redis.<p>Interested? Tell us about yourself: mikhanov@fountain-digital.com (my name is Sergey).","time":1380665088,"type":"comment"}
