Range is an iOS kitchen thermometer that helps cooks get better results. Twine is a little square that lets your objects and environments talk on the Internet with little effort. But this is just the beginning. So much technology fails to serve our needs. We want to give soul to electronics, and make connections between us.<p>We get to directly affect the way regular people perceive and interact with their physical world. We&#x27;re small, so we each wear several hats and have the power to do wonderful things quickly. We&#x27;re flexible about work schedule and working from home. We work intensely on the product, but we&#x27;re informal about everything else.<p>If you&#x27;re as passionate about building beautifully integrated hardware&#x2F;software products as we are, we want to talk to you.","time":1380660603,"type":"comment"}
