You need to know a lot about Linux internals, but also Windows, since one of the major projects you&#x27;ll be involved in will be a gradual environment shift to Linux. You&#x27;ll be diagnosing and remedying performance and availability issues. You&#x27;ll be trying to wring more speed from our already very efficient cluster and add more 9’s to our availability metrics. You&#x27;ll be writing code (bonus! in an exotic language!) to move data around, implement high availability and fault tolerance, to do logging and performance reporting, and who knows what else. You&#x27;re going to be the person we all go to when it comes to the low-level arcana, so you&#x27;re very familiar with the Way Things Work. You know who you are. Let us know too.<p>Please send your resume to jobs@1010data.com","time":1380657732,"type":"comment"}
