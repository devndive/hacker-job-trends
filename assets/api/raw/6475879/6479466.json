Before ShowKit, it would take companies and software engineers months of intensive development to add features like audio&#x2F;video conferencing, screen sharing, and gesture control to their applications. Our first-to-market gesture control functionality empowers users to tap, swipe, highlight, and fully control another users’ screen remotely while simultaneously connecting the two users via audio&#x2F;video conference.<p>Notably, ShowKit is the only framework that includes hardware accelerated video encoding &amp; decoding. This enables 720p at 30fps, the highest quality video conferencing resolution on the market, while using minimal cpu resources and allowing the app to run seamlessly in the background while a call is taking place. Comparable solutions use full cpu resources &amp; only achieve 4-5fps at that resolution, which isn’t feasible for video conferencing.<p>AngelList Profile: <a href=\"http://angel.co/showkit\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;showkit</a>\nShowKit Demo Videos: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/ShowKitSDK\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;ShowKitSDK</a><p>Our Office &amp; Perks:\nOur Penthouse office sits on the historic Sunset Strip with the best view of all of LA. \n- Top of the line gear\n- Kitchen stocked full of drinks and snacks\n- Friendly and down-to-earth work environment\n- Health, Dental &amp; Vision Coverage","time":1380666373,"type":"comment"}
