Our members include some of the world’s premier financial exchanges, trading firms, data centers and cloud providers. We are bringing transparency and trust to a $350B market that is fragmented to hell and dominated by middlemen ripping off enterprises that don’t know the true value of their infrastructure.<p>We’re hiring for several technical and non-technical roles:<p>* Senior Engineer - build the beating heart of a commodities exchange in the cloud<p>* Front-end Developer - build the front-end infrastructure of the exchange<p>* Mobile Developer - bring consumer-level ease and beauty to datacenter management<p>* Data Scientist - help refine the predictive Kelley Blue Book of IT<p>* Technical Writer - help us show how and why commoditization will reshape the industry, speed up innovation, save billions and reduce e-waste<p>We’ve raised $3.3MM in funding and pay top of market, plus equity. We are not buying eyeballs in hopes of selling them later. We are attacking massive market inefficiencies and generating extremely healthy margins. We are both riding and driving a huge change in the way IT infrastructure is bought, used and sold.<p>We&#x27;re pragmatists, not purists. We’ve bought into reality, whatever that might be, not married to our ideas. You&#x27;ll fit in best if you are as well. We’re seasoned veterans with big wins and big, educational losses under our belts. We try to use the right technology for the job, with familiarity being a tie breaker. We’re not religious about platforms. Some things we use today: Node.js, ElasticSearch, Asgard, Redis and CouchDB and a slew of AWS services.<p>If any of that sounds interesting, please email me directly at benblair@markitx.com","time":1380667640,"type":"comment"}
