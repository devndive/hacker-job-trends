The position is a 12 month temp req and while we&#x27;re hoping we can turn whoever fills this roll into a full time employee after the 12 month period we can not guarantee that.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone experienced in enterprise application administration. Ideally in the ETL or BI space. The application you would be working with primarily would be Informatica PowerCenter [<a href=\"http://www.informatica.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.informatica.com</a>]. The job posting gives a run down of the various skill sets we&#x27;re looking for.<p>That being said the reason I&#x27;m posting this here is that we haven&#x27;t had much luck finding a good fit for this position using the traditional avenues. I&#x27;m a big fan of the community here and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s more than a few people here that would be right for the job.<p>This goes for all job postings, but even if you don&#x27;t feel you meet all of the requirements, apply anyway. When it comes down to it, we&#x27;re looking for talented, smart people with a passion for technology and an eagerness to learn. If that&#x27;s you, we&#x27;re looking forward to hearing from you.","time":1372689923,"type":"comment"}
