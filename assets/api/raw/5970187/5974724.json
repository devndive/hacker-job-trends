Our sunny Los Angeles office is fueled by an abundant supply of coconut water, coffee, and camaraderie -- with an irrepressible dash of mischief. In case you don’t live in LA or you’re not a US citizen, we consider relocation and&#x2F;or visa costs to be a small price to pay for world-class talent.<p>ABOUT YOU: We set the bar extremely high at Scopely, but that&#x27;s the type of environment you crave. Your ambition to build something significant and lasting is exceeded only by your desire to be surrounded by coworkers who are equally relentless. If you are itching to be involved in a startup that&#x27;s going places and where you can have a considerable impact, then you just might have found your calling at Scopely.<p>TO APPLY: Check out the latest openings and apply here:<a href=\"http://www.scopely.com/jobs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scopely.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a>","time":1372724089,"type":"comment"}
