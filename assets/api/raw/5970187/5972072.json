REMOTE possible.\nTwisted Oak Studios is looking for a strong developer interested in project management for our 4 year old worker-owned consulting company.<p>Our company&#x27;s focus is high-tech interactive projects. Over the past year, our work has included game development (particularly in Unity 3D), graphics&#x2F;shader programming, and language and audio processing. We’re mostly platform agnostic (mobile, desktop, embedded, custom hardware). We don’t do much web tech.<p>We&#x27;re interested in working with people who care about their craft. Ideally this includes thinking at both the design level:<p>- data driven work estimation<p>- keeping long term technical requirements in mind<p>- thinking about how a piece of work contributes to product&#x2F;project end-value<p>And the implementation level:<p>- code standards<p>- readability<p>- maintainability<p>- exploring new effective development paradigms &amp; techniques.<p>For this position we’d like to hear a little bit about you, see something that you’ve worked on that you’re proud of, and hear about how you approach large-ish projects with a team.<p>We offer strong compensation, prioritize developer quality of life (limiting work-weeks, flexible hours), and do varied interesting work. Lots of opportunities and support for professional development and side-projects.<p>Lastly, if the relationship is great after 6-12 months, we’ll want to transition away from wages in to shared-ownership.<p>Hit me up at jobs@twistedoakstudios.com. I’m committed to responding to every serious note I receive.","time":1372699063,"type":"comment"}
