We&#x27;re looking for experienced software engineers who are up to that challenge, and who have a track record of working in an environment that demands a high level of quality.<p>We do clinical genomic variant analysis. We take whole exome sequence data and predict clinical outcome for the variants we observe in patients, which is then used by clinicians to inform treatment. To do this, we aggregate large amounts of additional data on individual genes and variants, and apply a series of proprietary algorithms. We started with seed funding and are currently profitable with revenue from our first customer.<p>We&#x27;re hiring our first engineer. At Codified your responsibilities will be wide - you will probably end up touching every piece of software we write, with an emphasis on the user facing applications. We are currently using GWT and mysql with some scripting in Python. Additionally, you&#x27;ll help us grow our team over the next few months as we continue to add engineers.<p>We have a large number of interesting projects under active development, spanning natural language processing, machine learning, user interface design and of course sequence analysis.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone who is experienced, flexible and willing to work outside of their comfort zone. A willingness to learn is more important to us than a Biology background, but the job will require you to learn the basics of the Biology that we&#x27;re working with.<p>We&#x27;re willing to consider remote work for experienced candidates, but preference will be shown to candidates in the Houston area.<p>We are offering 70k+ salary and equity.
