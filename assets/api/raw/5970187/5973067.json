We need someone to help us assemble the airplane as it is taking off, so we need a strongly independent candidate that understands teamwork and compromise. You&#x27;ll have a lot of autonomy in this role, and will be making big choices on a rapidly scaling application. Don&#x27;t read this as you will not be supported, quite the opposite. Read this as we value your opinion and work and expect you to be deeply integrated within our team. We need to be able to depend on you, and you need to be able to depend on us.<p>What we are looking for:<p>- Our concurrent code is built in Java and handles thousands of requests a second, 24&#x2F;7. We need help keeping it happy and behaving well from deployment, to scaling to everyday operations.<p>- We run on a variety of Amazon Web Services like DynamoDB, EC2 and SQS - we need to get the most out of it. Prior experience here is a huge plus.<p>- Our code handles thousands of dollars worth of transactions a day, and is up 24&#x2F;7 so we need to monitor everything. We like Scout, Nagios and Graphite. If you have strong feelings about why these are the wrong tools, we would love to hear that too.","time":1372707582,"type":"comment"}
