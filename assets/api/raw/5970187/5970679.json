Today, we&#x27;re serving several other networks too, including Seedcamp, NXTP, Union Square, AOL, Angelhack. We&#x27;re doing some pretty interesting stuff in the intersection of community and startup data&#x2F;metrics. We&#x27;re mainly looking for:<p>1) Ruby developers with a particular interest in data and metrics. If AARRR means something to you, or you like the idea of mining data for insights that help entrepreneurs and funds kick ass, get in touch.<p>2) User experience designers or front-end developers interested in crafting great products.<p>If you fit one of these two profiles, you&#x27;ll find my contact information in my profile. We&#x27;re funded and have a stellar team working with some of the greatest accelerator programs, venture capital firms and entrepreneurs out there. Looking forward to hearing from some of you.","time":1372687503,"type":"comment"}
