We are bringing the Gym to your home over live video. The fitness options today work for the highly motivated but not for the rest which is evident in the rising obesity rates in the country.<p>We want you to come help us design our user experiences. Our users are across all age groups, some who are fit and some who are wanting to be more fit. Our design challenge is to build a product that makes it really easy for users to do a workout from end-to-end by getting out of their way and wowing them with the experience.<p>We think any of our team mates should have the following traits. Hardworking, analytical and a great sense of humor. They should be serious about their work, but not take themselves too seriously. We recommend that you try our product so you can tell us how you can make us better.<p>Our customers love us. Every 2 out of 3 users who works out with one of our trainers comes back for more. We graduated from Rock Health in Spring and have some great investors who get marketplaces such as ours. We make money when users pay to workout with a trainer. And our prices are a fraction of the gym costs thanks to efficiencies we provide. This also means we are lowering the cost for our customers.<p>We use our own platform to keep ourselves healthy. We are a small team, so your impact and influence on our culture will be huge. We love the Netflix philosophy of context and control.<p>Contact us at jobs@wello.com or ping me at amol@wello.com with your resume.","time":1372707313,"type":"comment"}
