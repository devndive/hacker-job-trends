{"by":"glou","id":5973892,"parent":5970187,"text":"Racevine.com - Los Angeles - Ruby on Rails Engineer - Full Time<p>Our motto is &quot;I heard it through the Racevine&quot;: We&#x27;re building a Yelp and Ticketmaster for endurance races (5K&#x27;s, marathons, triathlons, etc). With society becoming more and more concerned about fitness&#x2F;wellness, endurance racing has become one of the fastest growing sports in the world, yet it lacks a goto source of information. We are building the world&#x27;s first comprehensive index of races and creating a community where people can connect and share their amazing experiences.<p>We are part of the inaugural class of the USC&#x2F;Kleiner Perkins Startup Accelerator (ending August 16th).  We&#x27;re in the accelerator&#x27;s LA offices until the end of the summer then plan to move to an office in the bay area shortly after.  If you join before the end of the program, you&#x27;ll get access to all the events and network the program has to offer.<p>You are ideally a full stack rails engineer with a passion for creating amazing consumer web experiences and would relish the opportunity to disrupt an industry traditionally underserved by tech.  You&#x27;ll be our first hire, so there&#x27;s tons of room to make a big impact.  Bonus points if you&#x27;ve ever done a race before!
