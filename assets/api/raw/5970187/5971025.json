Fulltime.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a full-stack engineer&#x2F;CTO to love the hell out of this problem. You&#x27;ll be the 4th member, and technical lead, of an incredibly talented team with a track record in insurance, startups, consumer marketing and design&#x2F;UX. We have had a successful alpha phase and are already revenue positive.<p><a href=\"http://knowitowl.theresumator.com/apply/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;knowitowl.theresumator.com&#x2F;apply&#x2F;</a><p>Do you want to solve:<p>A problem with scale.  Insurance is a $2 trillion industry.  That’s 36 times larger than Google and Facebook combined. Insurers pay their aging sales force a mint to sell insurance the old-fashioned way (with paper, face-to-face). We’re going to change this.<p>A problem that’s socially important.  Nobody’s helping people figure out insurance – and that’s bad. Under-insured medical problems contribute to over half of all personal bankruptcies and home foreclosures.  We’re going to deliver social impact.<p>A problem in desperate need of a new approach. The consumer problem in insurance is deceptively simple: insurance is hard to sell because people don’t want to think about bad things like death and illness. Insurers just throw money at the problem: advertising, hefty commissions, pushy sales agents. We’re introducing a new approach.<p>We’re looking to build our team with people who understand the importance of what we’re doing and want to apply their talent and energy to solving a Big Problem. We’re searching for Davids ready to take on Goliath. Come join Virgil and the KnowItOwl team to bring the $2 trillion insurance industry into the 21st century.","time":1372690322,"type":"comment"}
