Founding Team.  www.cinecandy.com<p>I am the founder of Cinecandy, the world's first Movie Studio As A Service (MSAAS, for cute).  I've spent the past year solo and I am looking for a programmer and a designer.<p>Think of what moviemaking is: a writer, a director, some actors, a post production crew, and ultimately distribution. If you think which parts of moviemaking have been disrupted by technology, really only distribution has. The creation of movies, however, has not!<p>My vision is to completely automate the moviemaking process, from scripting, to directing, acting, post-production, and distribution.  And Cinecandy will make it so easy that anyone can do it, and do it with their friends.<p>The first step in achieving that vision is a tool that will let people easily create group videos with their friends for special occasions.  The example I like to use is the video shown at a wedding by the Best Man while he gives a speech - lots of well-wishing from friends and family in the video.<p>Because this initial set of users will show their videos in public, they are willing to pay for an automatically produced video.  More if it's professionally edited.<p>I sold my last startup (www.gamemaki.com) and had a major flop with an app earlier this year:<p>allthingsd.com/20110425/meet-remember-it-an-iphone-app-born-of-a-hangover/<p>But I ship product and this one has me pretty stoked.  More about me in my HN profile.  Do reach out - I love talking about my baby!","time":1320369160,"type":"comment"}
