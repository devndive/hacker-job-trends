But the truth is, we have great jobs for a lot of people. Want to work on awesome visualizations for gigabytes and terabytes of data daily? We got it. Want to work on building a development platform for an extremely powerful data analysis tool? We got it. Want to help make the core server that powers our extremely fast indexing and performance better? We got it.<p>Whether it's UI, core systems engineering, dev platform or anything in between, we likely have something for you.<p>I personally work on the development platform in the Seattle office, but I'm happy to answer questions about anything. Feel free to shoot me an email (in my profile), or comment here.<p>Also, check out our new dev portal which we launched recently: <a href=\"http://dev.splunk.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dev.splunk.com</a>","time":1320172016,"type":"comment"}
