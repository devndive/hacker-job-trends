Full time.<p>We're looking for developers and development managers.<p>The AWS Relational Database Service is one of the fastest-growing AWS businesses, providing super-simple provisioning and management for databases in the cloud. Customers can set up a new database with just a few clicks, and complex administrative tasks like scaling, fail-over, and monitoring are all reliably handled by our control systems.<p>Providing such simplified management for customers comes with the challenge of building sophisticated and reliable control systems. We work on many hard problems: high-performance online transaction processing; partitioned,replicated, real-time, in-memory processing; and large-scale, high-throughput batch jobs. We not only work on deep technical problems, but also use a wide array of technologies, ranging from the various database engines we support(MySQL and Oracle currently) to just about every other AWS service, and many open-source components.<p>Please email a resume to malleta at amazon.com if you're interested.","time":1320165014,"type":"comment"}
