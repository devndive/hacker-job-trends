Full-time Software Engineers.<p>FathomDB needs you to build the next-generation relational database.  Fully buzzword-compliant: distributed, fault-tolerant and cloud-ready; more importantly a great engineering project to do the first real redesign of the database since the mainframe.  Your day-to-day is as much research as it is coding, as you'll be implementing things that have never been built that way before, that you probably invented over a team brainstorming session in the morning, maybe even using some insight you gained from your dreams the night before.<p>We work in C++(0x); you'll likely be experienced in C++ or C and an object-orientated language but what's more important is that you want to think and work where there are no signposts, and that you're comfortable doing so.  Experience with distributed systems or databases is a positive indicator, but I'll read and reply to every application to hn.jobs@fathomdb.com","time":1320165696,"type":"comment"}
