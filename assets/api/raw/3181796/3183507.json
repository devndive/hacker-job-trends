Because you want to put a dent in the universe.  These are some of the things we do at Shelby:<p><pre><code>  Work with (and watch tons of) online video\n  Process updates in real time from a growing list of firehoses\n  Use the best technology for the job (Rails, Mongo, Node, Redis, Beanstalk…)\n  Develop and contribute open source\n  Love the modern web (HTML5, CSS 3, JS, modern browsers)\n  Stay the fuck away from IE &#60; 9 and Flash\n  Love every screen (monitor, tablet, phone, tv, headrest, IMAX)\n  Focus on building an exceptional team that builds something people want\n</code></pre>\nWe're looking for great people that never want to stop improving.  We'd would love to find a bad ass front end person (own the product UI and everything else our community sees) who is looking for a wide range of opportunities &#38; responsibilities.  But these “positions” are buried in this post because they’re more like guidelines.<p>We’re backed by some of the best investors in the game and we hang our hats in our own office at 23rd and Park in NYC (though we’re cool with people working remotely).<p>More info here: <a href=\"http://shel.tv/qWsIxv\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://shel.tv/qWsIxv</a>","time":1320173322,"type":"comment"}
