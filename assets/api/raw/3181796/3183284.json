We're a small team that loves what we do. We only hire others who love what they do, too.<p>Even though we're very profitable, we don't hire just for the sake of it; we hire the best people, then trust them: it's the thinking behind our no-limit vacation policy and company credit card for everyone.<p>We love building things and we focus on being productive, not the amount of time you spend in the office. We hate meetings, so we only have one per week.<p>We put a lot of effort into making Weebly a fun place to work for people who like getting things done.<p>Our millions of users love us (check out our blog comments). We have a net promoter score over 80% (higher than Apple's).<p>Running 2% of all of the websites on the Internet presents some very interesting technical challenges. Making a complex task super simple and intuitive is also an ongoing challenge.","time":1320170645,"type":"comment"}
