The Internet advertising industry is quite complex behind the scenes and somewhat parallels the structure of the financial markets. We are analogous to a high frequency trading firm, buying page views to serve ads in real-time on exchanges like that of Google or Yahoo. Our server software runs on Spring, MySQL, Redis, and AWS at a glance. We handle at least a billion page impressions a day. Big data, big throughput.\nSmall yet experienced team, catered lunches _everyday_, your choice of Mac or PC (dev team is almost all Mac now), good benefits. Our office has superhero posters all over the walls.<p>Contact me directly at sahil_lmn@yahoo.com.<p>I actually got hired through a HN \"Who is Hiring\" thread. These things do work!","time":1320168203,"type":"comment"}
