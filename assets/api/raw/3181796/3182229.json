Was your childhood room full of toys you'd taken apart and put back together in ridiculous ways?  You may be just who we're looking for.<p>At Matasano Security, some of the most interesting companies in the world hire us to break their code/hardware in terrible, terrible ways, and we're looking for people to join the team.  Security experience is great but not required, and we love people with interesting backgrounds and insights.  Above all else, you have to be quick on your feet and be comfortable learning entirely new languages, frameworks, platforms, etc while attacking a product.  You'll be pushed to the very limits of your capabilities and love every minute of it.<p>If this sounds like fun to you (and it is!), check out <a href=\"http://www.matasano.com/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.matasano.com/careers</a>","time":1320158545,"type":"comment"}
