We need great engineers to join us in this ambitious goal. This isn't some Web 2.0 company flipping bits for ad sales. We have difficult and interesting engineering problems to solve. We need people who will not back down if they have to write a compiler, work in a new programming language, or hack a fast approximate solution to an NP-complete problem.<p>We move fast. We launched our private beta a little over two months after starting the company. Since then we've signed up over 3000 developers and have dozens of production apps in the store running on Parse.<p>We are four very technical cofounders who have been early employees or founders at successful startups. No matter your background, you will learn a lot working with the team at Parse.<p>We offer significant equity, market salary, fully covered health insurance, your choice of equipment, but most importantly the opportunity to reinvent how applications are built.<p>Please get in touch - email jobs@parse.com\nFind out more: <a href=\"https://www.parse.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.parse.com/jobs</a>","time":1320165304,"type":"comment"}
