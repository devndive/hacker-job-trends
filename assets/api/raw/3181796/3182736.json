Unlike videoconferencing, youâ€™re not stuck to a wall or desk. It becomes your physical presence, anywhere in the world, with the freedom to move and interact with people as if you were there. Our technology has already been seen by millions of people, and we think the potential impact is substantial.<p>We're looking for great engineers and designers. We need help in C++, multimedia, test and verification, web frontend and backend, UI/UX design, electrical, networking, and more. We think this could be a unique opportunity for someone with experience in web or mobile to work on something a little different.<p>We have funding, offer competitive compensation and benefits, and provide perks such as food and ping pong.<p>Candidates must be authorized to work in the U.S.<p>More information is available on our site: <a href=\"http://suitabletech.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://suitabletech.com</a><p>Contact: jobs@suitabletech.com","time":1320163975,"type":"comment"}
