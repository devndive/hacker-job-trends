Full time.<p>I work at MIT Lincoln Laboratory (<a href=\"http://www.ll.mit.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ll.mit.edu</a>), a research and development center run by MIT that does work for the government. My group has about 20 people in it and does application security, reverse engineering, and other low level systems stuff. Knowledge of things like assembly, operating systems, and systems are pluses but not required. It's great if you have some experience in those things, but if you can code I want to talk to you. The pluses:<p>* Extremely difficult and rewarding problems. In the past few weeks my work has had me hacking on a compiler, scaling up databases, reversing malware, etc. We're a really agile and tight knit group.<p>* Awesome workplace culture. We're a 9-5 shop, you pick your laptop, and you can order any books that you need.<p>* We reimburse tuition for classes at MIT. Last semester my office mate took operating systems with Robert Morris. We send you to conferences, including Blackhat and Defcon.<p>* We sponsor relocation and have multiple positions we want to fill.<p>You do need to be a US citizen and you will have to get a security clearance. I'm happy to talk to you about how the clearance process works and answer any questions you have. If you're local I'll buy you a cup of coffee while we talk it over. You really can't waste my time. The first step is to get in touch with me and I can explain to you how our hiring process works.<p>Email: tsally@mit.edu","time":1320154732,"type":"comment"}
