We've hired people from these threads with everywhere from 0 to 10 years of experience.\nWe're profitable, very well funded and have a really fun office environment (go-karts + a zipline!). We've got flexible hours, a very engineer-driven company culture, and a really terrific team.<p>Scribd alumni have gone on to found 4 other YCombinator companies, more than from any other startup. We think this says something about the kind of people that we like to hire.<p>We're working on a big new product launch now that we're really excited about. If you're interested in eBooks, I'd love to tell you about it.<p>Generally we're looking for full-time and INTERN hires (junior year or older) who want to move to SF.
