We aspire to develop a model that sits at the intersection of disciplines and brings together great people from all over to build interesting companies. We believe innovation often charts its own path and we thus adjust ourselves accordingly by being experimental and lean in our approach.<p>Our ideas seem not bound by verticals or geographies. We are light–packers, risk takers and tend to be driven a bit differently. We are made up of not employees, rather co–founder caliber individuals. We are school, degree and work experience agnostic. What is important to us is: integrity, energy/personality and intelligence (in that order) to apply please visit <a href=\"http://subtledisruption.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://subtledisruption.com</a> .
