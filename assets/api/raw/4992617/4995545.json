Ruby on Rails + jQuery stack, 15-ish person engineering team, the usual startup perks (catering, snacks, soda, etc), gym membership reimbursement, etc.<p>Ways we're trying to make ourselves better engineers:<p>- Deliberate practice with our tools. If you are a vim user, we have the programmer who wrote Command-T on staff and he's a great person to learn from.<p>- Every changeset gets pushed to Gerrit where it waits to get a +1 from our build suite (that runs in 3 minutes) and a +1 from a human reviewer.<p>- Over the last 4 months, we've upgraded from Rails 2.1 to 3.2.3 and are using the static asset pipeline, SASS/Compass, and HAML. We're the largest site I know of on Rails 3.2. We gave a presentation on the upgrade at last weeks SF Rails meetup, slides at causes.github.com/migrating-rails-talk<p>- Everyone is encouraged to take one hour from their day to learn about something they wouldn't otherwise (aka study hall).<p>- Every story is scoped so that it can be completed in less than a day. We don't branch, we just work on top of master. We've found that the closer we stay to master, the less needless work we create for ourselves.<p>Causes is a great place to better yourself and the world. We're particularly looking for a:\n- DEVOPS ENGINEER \n- FULL-STACK ENGINEER\n- iOS ENGINEER<p>If interested, please check our our team page at www.causes.com/team and apply at jobs@causes.com and use \"HN\" in the subject line.","time":1357107856,"type":"comment"}
