Principals only please.<p>Radius Intelligence provides data and tools to help companies reach over 20 million small businesses. Consider that many companies you read about here on HackerNews need to effectively reach these companies to sell to them. Payments companies, deals companies... you get the idea.<p>The reason I joined Radius is two-fold: I want to work on products that can benefit small businesses and I like the fact that our product <i>directly</i> benefits from our work with data. We're selling the data we have with a cool web application, not using data science to get a 1% lift of clicks on the blue button.<p>So we're looking for solid software engineers to work on all sorts of problems. We have a sophisticated web application implemented in Python and Javascript and we have our back-end data processing tech which is implemented in Java with Hadoop, Hive and HBase. We have paying customers, but we're on the ground floor with both -- now is the time to join us and make a huge impact. We also need an engineer who is interested in test and performance.<p>Drop a line: jobs@radiusintel.com . Thanks.","time":1357055314,"type":"comment"}
