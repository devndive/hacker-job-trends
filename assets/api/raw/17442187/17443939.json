Our analyzer scans applications in some two dozen languages, analyzing their source code, looking for hundreds of different types of vulnerabilities.  We are looking for someone to join our core static analysis team.  Our <i>ideal</i> candidate would have a CS PhD or equivalent experience, with emphasis on static analysis using abstract interpretation, and would have worked on whole-program analyzers for dynamic languages such as JavaScript or Python.  (Knowledge of points-to analysis or higher-order flow analysis is especially desirable.)  But such people are quite rare; we would be happy to hear from anyone with compiler internals experience.  Come help us make the world&#x27;s software safer by advancing the state of the art in static analysis!
