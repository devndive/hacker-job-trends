We write tools that are used to secure the largest web applications and APIs in the world. If you&#x27;ve ever watched a video or streamed music online, your data has probably been secured by code we&#x27;ve written. To date, our software has found and fixed over two million security vulnerabilities in the web. Our goal is to reduce the time it takes to find and fix vulnerabilities and make it a part of the software building process.<p>We work in many different domains in a highly collaborative environment. This involves everything from distributed systems to static analysis to information architecture. We value speed, but we value stability and an approachable user experience more. Our software stack is primarily Elixir, Ruby, and Go, but we&#x27;re advocates of choosing the best tool for the job. If something like Elm is going to help you solve a problem more effectively then we want to provide you a place to convince us of that and keep our software moving forward.<p>Sound interesting?
