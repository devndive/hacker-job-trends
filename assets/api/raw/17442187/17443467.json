Currently speaking to investors about raising a seed round of $1-2m with the right founding team onboard. You should have no disillusions, everyone will be paid a fair market salary to work on Open Source, do training, speak at meetups, conferences and help build something that already has strong traction. The goal is to build the Spring of 2020.<p>Our future work will involve machine learning as we move from not just making cloud-native apps distributed but also intelligent.<p>If this is of interest ping me at asim@micro.mu or dm me in the slack at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;slack.micro.mu\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;slack.micro.mu</a>","time":1530551464,"type":"comment"}
