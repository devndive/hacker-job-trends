Penetration testing, security analysis, DFIR, and cutting-edge research into current technologies and attacks (breaking things). You spend most of your day thinking about security systems and how they can break. You get to be creative and have a lot of freedom to be clever while learning new technologies at a very fast pace. Engagements are usually 2-4 weeks long and in a year you will be exposed to 15-20 products and technology stacks. Your work will typically initiate person-months of security improvements in products millions of people use. You will have access to senior engineers&#x2F;architects and your findings&#x2F;ideas will be heard by senior decision makers. You will have enormous impact in making the software and products people use safer!<p>All of our consultants are also security researchers, with dedicated research time. Not too shabby!<p>Examples of some of our current openings include:<p>* Head of Research (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nccgroup.trust&#x2F;us&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;careers&#x2F;current-vacancies&#x2F;head-of-research&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nccgroup.trust&#x2F;us&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;careers&#x2F;current-vacan...</a>), which is just as awesome as it sounds.<p>* Strategic Infrastructure Security, Practice Director (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nccgroup.trust&#x2F;us&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;careers&#x2F;current-vacancies&#x2F;practice-director-strategic-infrastructure-security-sis&#x2F;);\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nccgroup.trust&#x2F;us&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;careers&#x2F;current-vacan...</a> Key services include external, internal, and wireless attacks, social engineering, physical intrusion, red team breach work, and others.<p>* Our amazing Risk Management &amp; Governance team (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nccgroup.trust&#x2F;us&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;careers&#x2F;current-vacancies&#x2F;security-consultant-rmg&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nccgroup.trust&#x2F;us&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;careers&#x2F;current-vacan...</a>) is growing leaps and bounds and expecting aggressive growth in the coming months.
