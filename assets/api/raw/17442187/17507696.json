(If not, I aplogize)<p>A crawling project is running into consistency issues in terms of the returned data&#x2F;content. The crawler targets a dynamic site (no curl&#x2F;wget) requiring a headless browser solution. The apparent issue - the crawler runs into &quot;issues&quot;, and as a result returns inconsistent content. However, if the process iterates&#x2F;loops it will eventually get the correct content. The test URLs work with a live browser FF&#x2F;Chrome&#x2F;Etc and return the result in a few secs. The test crawler often takes minutes!<p>The current stack for the crawler -- Centos7&#x2F;Py&#x2F;Selenium&#x2F;Chrome (headless)<p>I&#x27;m looking for someone who has serious skills in the domain of headless browser crawling, with a deep&#x2F;thorough understanding of possible issues with crawling. The goal is to have the crawler return the correct results in a minimum amount of time.<p>Current possible issues to investigate&#x2F;solve&#x2F;handle:\n -Gateway Timeout Issues\n -Page Not Found Issues\n -Other Incorrect&#x2F;Weird Content!<p>I&#x27;m also willing to contemplate that a consistent crawl can&#x27;t be achieved, but I&#x27;m fairly certain the goal can be accomplished.<p>If anyone wants to reply for more information, or to discuss, feel free to ping me and let&#x27;s see what happens.<p>Thanks<p>-bruce\nbadouglas@gmail.com","time":1531323143,"type":"comment"}
