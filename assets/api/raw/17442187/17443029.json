Based in NYC and Princeton, we are a rapidly growing startup sending out thousands of products to happy customers each week.

You’ll be working with a small team of friendly, easy-going, relaxed engineers. Board game skills a plus. ;)\nYour qualifications - 3+ years of experience in software development roles - Experience with Python-powered web-apps (Flask, Jinja, Google Cloud, Google App Engine, Stripe) - MySQL, Google Cloud SQL, PeeWee ORM - Experience with Git, PyTest, and deployments to Google Cloud.","time":1530548890,"type":"comment"}
