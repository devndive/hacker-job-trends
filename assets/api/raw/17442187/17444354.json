As a developer, your typical day-to-day involves: writing maintainable code (probably goes without saying), having your day ruined by functional QA testers who find every bug you write, carrying out and being on the receiving end of intense code review sessions from your peers who hold your work (and their own) at the highest of standards, agonizing over the user experience until even a trained monkey could use the product, collaborating with and mentoring your peers on security best practices, and finally, deploying your code to production and seeing the customer create something amazing and beautiful with it.
