It is as natural as using real pen and paper but also has all the benefits of being digital. It was created from our founder&#x27;s frustration of taking readable and reusable notes on his first iPad.<p>- We are psyched about the future of computing: touch screen + keyboard + pen\n- We sponsor work visa. Come work in Hong Kong, one of the best Asian cities\n- You will be working with makers. Every engineering members have shipped their own products outside of work.\n- We are bootstrapped and we were one of the top paid iOS apps last year.\n- We have excellent work-life balance because we hire people we can trust. 2 optional days (Thurs &amp; Fri) to work at home.
