See us on BBC News @ 6:15PM tonight. :-)<p>OpenRent is the way people rent property online - a force for good in an industry tarnished by rip-off agencies. Enabled by an unrelenting focus on technology, we now let more properties than any high-street agency in the UK. In the last 12m we let over £11.5bn worth of property, to over 1 million registered users, without charging any admin fees to tenants.<p>We&#x27;re VC backed, profitible, and with plenty of ambition. As such, we&#x27;re continuing to grow the team and still have a couple of positions open. We&#x27;re looking for generalists, thought-leaders, and those with a passion for solving real-world problems.<p>You&#x27;ll be working in a close-knit team, directly with the founders. You&#x27;ll have full autonomy to work on, and figure out how best to solve, the biggest problems in the industry. We find problems and improve customer experiences via code every day.<p>- Full Stack Developer (C#) | £80k (negotiable based on experience) | up to 0.25% equity<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;openrent&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;openrent&#x2F;jobs</a><p>Recent press coverage: - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;openrent&#x2F;activity#press\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;openrent&#x2F;activity#press</a><p>Contact via AngelList or email in profile.
