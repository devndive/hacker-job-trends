We’re looking for two engineers:<p>- Senior Engineer (.NET, JS) - you will lead the development of our desktop product, Draftable Desktop.<p>- R&amp;D Engineer - you will work on improving the document comparison algorithms which power all of our products.<p>We prefer remote hires, but we’re open to an on-site hire in our Melbourne office.<p>We’re looking for experienced and self-reliant engineers. We expect you to work a full time load of 40 hours per week (and no more) and to be very productive during that time.<p>We know you have a life outside work, so we will respect your non-working and family time. We don’t expect you to make work your life.<p>Our tech stack: .NET (mostly C# with some F# and some C++), Python&#x2F;Django, Javascript&#x2F;React, PostgreSQL, Redis and RabbitMQ.<p>We’re easy-going and easy to work with. We’re developer-led and have a flat structure. We are collaborative, and we expect you to take an active role in evolving our engineering culture. We like writing things down. We love Slack. We launch things as soon as they’re ready. We do things right the first time, even if it takes a little longer. We don’t have much technical debt.<p>More details at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;draftable.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;draftable.com&#x2F;careers</a>.","time":1530575430,"type":"comment"}
