Unlike most healthcare startups, we are embedded within a hospital (two actually -- Mass General Hospital and Brigham &amp; Women&#x27;s Hospital) giving us access to the clinicians and data we need to solve the most important issues facing medicine today. And with support from Nvidia, GE, and Nuance, we have the HW, translational expertise, and financial support to execute on our mission.<p>We&#x27;re hiring for multiple roles on our ML, SW, Product, Data Eng, and Infrastructure teams.
