We just launched monetization a few weeks ago and are currently bootstapped, so we are not looking to hire quite yet, but expect to make our first developer hire within the next 4-12 weeks.<p>We use React &#x2F; Mobx in the front-end, and Rails as a API server in the backend.  I&#x27;m looking for someone to adapt our current codebase to React Native, so React Native eperience is a must.  Interest in (spoken) languages is a huge plus! :)<p>Remote is totally fine, though Berlin is preferred.<p>Contact me at jeremy@seedlang.com","time":1530553615,"type":"comment"}
