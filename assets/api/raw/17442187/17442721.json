If you have seen what physicians have to put up with, it&#x27;s a bad version of the 90s, and makes medical care worse and more expensive for everyone. We are a group of previously successful engineers and entrepreneurs (MIT, Dartmouth, Datapower, Stripe, Salesforce, etc) and senior doctors (John Hopkins, UCSF, Oxford, etc) who are determined to finally fix this.<p>Compensation: market salary &amp; equity -- we are well funded.<p>Stack: includes Rust, React and Node. We will also be solving some very interesting problems in the areas of APIs, domain-specific machine-learning and fine-grained application security.<p>Please email jobs@listrunnerapp.com and mention &quot;[hnjobs]&quot; in the subject line.","time":1530546905,"type":"comment"}
