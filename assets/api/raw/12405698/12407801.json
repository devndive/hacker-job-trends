Planet runs a large data processing pipeline that crunches terabytes of imagery per day downloaded from our custom, manufactured-in-the-office satellites. We run a cloud-first, API-driven architecture with the goal of enabling everyone in the world to access our imagery. Our ‘full stack’ runs from the spacecraft to our web tools, and there are enough hard and interesting problems to keep many teams busy for a long time to come.<p>Our mission is to image the entire Earth every day, and provide universal access to that data. A platform engineer not only builds public API’s and interfaces, but will be an integral part in the architecture and design of high availability, scalable, maintainable services to power our mission.
