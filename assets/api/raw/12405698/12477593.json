My company, Veridikal Publishing, is a pre-seed and pre-revenue startup in the academic publishing sphere. We are currently part of the Founder Institute (fi.co) in Bangkok. Essentially, we are an open access journal publisher that helps authors publish papers in our and other journals as well as educating them on academic publishing.\nCurrently, we are looking for a developer interested in equity until we get seed funding and&#x2F;or revenue.<p>So, we offer a maximum amount of flexibility in terms of technology stack, working arrangements, and schedule. We are currently based in Bangkok, but are a registered company in the USA.<p>If you are interested send an email with your resume, portfolio, etc... to info@veridikal.tk . New and junior developers are encouraged to apply.","time":1473661159,"type":"comment"}
