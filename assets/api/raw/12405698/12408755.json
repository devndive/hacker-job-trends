Our product is targeted at developers and built on the newest web tech (such as React, ES6, Elixir). Our tech challenges include great API design for our customer&#x27;s developers, a scalable real-time messaging backend, fantastic design and UX, and most of all writing great code fast with a tiny team.<p>We&#x27;re looking for experienced programmers in the Eindhoven region (office at a 5 minute walk from the train station). Unlike many startups we&#x27;re not ageist and we have sane European working hours. We&#x27;re a small team and you&#x27;ll have significant impact on all aspects of the product.<p>We&#x27;re particularly interested in experienced people who&#x27;re on the verge of being promoted into some middle management &#x2F; &quot;architect&quot; role, but prefer to actually build great software with great programmers and move 4x faster, sustainably, than the average dev team. All that said, if that&#x27;s not you but you&#x27;d like to get there fast, get in touch as well.<p>Contact info is on our website: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkjs.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkjs.com</a>","time":1472762857,"type":"comment"}
