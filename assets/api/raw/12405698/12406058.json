For an example of one of the things we&#x27;ve been working on, see this blog post: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;themacro.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2016&#x2F;08&#x2F;investor-day-software&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;themacro.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2016&#x2F;08&#x2F;investor-day-software&#x2F;</a><p>We&#x27;re looking for a couple of great hackers to join us. It&#x27;s not a job for everyone, but it would be a good fit for someone who loves startups.
