Canary combines the latest advances in computer vision, learning, and data science to help our users live more secure lives.<p>I lead the data engineering team at Canary, and am looking to grow this team in pursuit of making our home security devices faster and smarter. Canary&#x27;s security camera is unique in that it comes with multiple onboard sensors - temperature, air quality, and humidity - that produce a continuous second data stream in addition to the visuals captured by each device.<p>Our team builds the data pipelines and underlying infrastructure that brings in and securely houses this data. As you can imagine, security is a first-class concern in everything we do. This creates many fascinating technical challenges, from crypto to network security to hardening of applications. \nWe&#x27;re all passionate about doing right by our users, and this passion shows in our designs, code, and planning.<p>Please have a look at the job posting[1] if you&#x27;re interested in learning more about the team and what we do. I&#x27;m also happy to answer any questions - e-mail is in my profile.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiegogo.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;canary-the-first-smart-home-security-device-for-everyone#&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiegogo.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;canary-the-first-smart-ho...</a>\n[1]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;s2a6b1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;s2a6b1</a>","time":1472745611,"type":"comment"}
