We&#x27;re a diverse, socially-saavy group from a variety of backgrounds. Our CTO is hands-on and engaged with what we do, offering insightful feedback without the tedious micro-managing.  We&#x27;re data-driven and value learning, testing, and getting it done together. Our team sits in the best part of the office with the sweetest views of the city. We have all the resources we need to execute effectively, and are a few steps away from of all the fun stuff, too (healthy food, hydration, and a sleepy three-legged dog who loves belly rubs).  The company has managed to harness a fickle audience, and now it&#x27;s our job to give them the experience of their lives. Come join us.<p>Check out openings here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.touchofmodern.com&#x2F;#jobvite\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.touchofmodern.com&#x2F;#jobvite</a>","time":1472859900,"type":"comment"}
