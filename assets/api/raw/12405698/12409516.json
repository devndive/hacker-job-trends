{"by":"respondwelljobs","id":12409516,"parent":12405698,"text":"Zimmer Biomet (formerly Respondwell) is hiring. We’re hoping to bring a couple of experienced people onboard to help us build serious games in the healthcare industry, specifically in the rehab space. We use video games to help people get back on their feet after they’ve broken themselves via sprains, breaks, falls, or surgery.<p>We&#x27;re looking for two important hires: The first is a database &amp; network engineer to help us scale our current system to deal with the increased server load as we continually get more patients &amp; clinicians. This position requires serious experience with PostgreSQL, setting up failover, replication, and load balancing on the server, and writing backend Python code to interface with the server web-framework (we use CherryPy). You&#x27;ll also need experience setting up and administering a Linux VPS through AWS (mostly) or Azure (not as much).<p>The second position is a Unity3D engineer. For this position you must have experience in Unity3D and C#, and have reasonable 3D math skills. Python experience is a huge plus but not required.<p>For both of these positions we’re looking for people who are self-directed and like working with cool technologies in ways that haven’t been used before. This job will definitely stretch your brain.<p>These jobs are located in Portland, Oregon, and would require relocation here, with assistance provided to the right candidates. We offer great salaries, great benefits, and a chance to work on projects that actually make people feel better. We work sane hours and don&#x27;t throw around words like rockstar or ninja to describe our team. Work&#x2F;life balance is extremely important to us.<p>If any of this sounds good and you fit the descriptions of what we&#x27;re looking for, send your resume &amp; any relevant links to jobs@respondwell.com and we&#x27;ll take it from there.","time":1472771288,"type":"comment"}
