Out of this passion, we&#x27;ve developed the worldâ€™s first wearable power meter for runners that provides insight into their running technique and performance.<p>We are looking for mobile developers who are knowledgable with Android and iOS development. We use Java for the Android and Swift for the iOS. Good sense of design is bonus.<p>We also want you to be an endurance runner, or a triathlete, or at least to have the passion about running. This is very important.<p>You will be leading the Android development for Stryd first, and possibly share the development for iOS in the future.<p>Being able to relocate to Boulder for the internship is preferred but we also consider the remote talent? BTW, if you like running, Boulder is pretty much your dream place. You get tons of opportunities to run and train with LOTS of elite athletes who are Stryd ambassadors here.<p>If interested, please send an email to kun@stryd.com","time":1472776890,"type":"comment"}
