The mission of SVAIL is to build hard AI technologies that let us impact hundreds of millions of users.<p>We work on deep learning for speech and language; systems research to drive scalability of deep learning models; and new product development to bring research success to end users.<p>We are hiring for <i>lots</i> of roles in all three of these areas. The above link has the full list, but I&#x27;d like to draw particular attention to our need for software engineers (the &quot;Software Engineer - AI Product&quot; role). There is a huge opportunity to be an early member of a newly-formed team responsible for building the next generation of AI-enabled products. No prior experience in machine learning or AI necessary -- if you are a strong engineer, we feel confident we can teach the needed ML.<p>Apply at the link above, or email eloise@baidu.com if you have questions (or ask right here).
