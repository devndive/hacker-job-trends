We&#x27;re generating revenue and among our customers, count a Fortune 50 company.\n* Looking for junior or senior software engineers, and (paid) interns. We&#x27;re less concerned with your skill set and more about what you would find motivating to work on every day. We do work that spans everything from Drones to AI to Data Viz to IOT.<p>About Converge:\n* Started in 2015, our founders were some of the first people to work on drones in the world, worked on the unmanned Blackhawk helicopter, and created the first mobile app ever for flying a drone (way back in 2008 at MIT...)\n* We like people who have excelled at something outside of work, and are just downright interesting to have a conversation with.\n* We like diamonds in the rough, but like to keep high expectations for each other.\n* If you are looking for a keg, ping pong table or bro culture, we&#x27;re not going to be a good fit for each other. We actually do fly drones for our job, so I guess that&#x27;s a culture benefit?\n* Our team is small, we&#x27;re very deliberate about hiring- you would be in the first 10 employees.<p>To get started, please go to this page to get ahold of us: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cvg.io&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cvg.io&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a><p>If you come from an underrepresented group in tech, please get in touch w&#x2F; me (@edave) directly via my HackerNews portfolio.<p>Some buzzwords for you keyword searchers: iOS, Android, Fullstack, Rails, Python, Ruby, React, ES6, Angular, Machine Learning","time":1472750998,"type":"comment"}
