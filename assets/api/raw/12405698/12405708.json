We have raised a seed round, have paying customers who love us, and are on track to be profitable.<p>You’ll be taking over the core engineering of the site, scaling it as we grow and implementing major new features. Because of this, we need someone with significant engineering experience (3-5 years full time work). You should be comfortable Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS. Bonus points if you have mobile experience and an interest in design.<p>Our development process is very collaborative. We&#x27;ll wireframe a new feature together, you&#x27;ll put together an end-to-end prototype, and we&#x27;ll iterate from that. We care more about clean maintainable code than domain expertise. Our stack includes Python (Tornado), Mongo, Swift, Heroku, Stripe, Twilio &amp; Mailgun.<p>If you want to apply, email me a short note about why this posting caught your attention and we’ll go from there.<p>I can’t wait to hear from you!<p>-Nick\nnick@storyworth.com<p>PS: Unfortunately we can’t sponsor a visa at this time, but we’re open to remote candidates if you’re a particularly good fit. Also, this role likely isn’t right for you if you graduated in the past year or recently completed a hacker school.","time":1472742028,"type":"comment"}
