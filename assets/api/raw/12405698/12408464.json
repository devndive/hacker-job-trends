We&#x27;re currently working on a variety of interesting and high-profile projects utilizing the latest real-time technology.<p>We&#x27;re seeking a front end (CSS, JS) specialist to augment our small, multi-disciplinary team of developers (with a focus on Rails). Looking for someone who loves building responsive&#x2F;adaptive websites that look great at any screen size. You should be self-motivated and confident in your ability to complete projects without daily guidance (we&#x27;re always on Slack but don&#x27;t have daily meetings, and count on everyone to manage their own work; within limits, we each set our own schedule).<p>We are all involved in the open source community and love helping each other grow as developers. A visual design background is great but not required. An interest in sports, too, is great but not required.<p>More info: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crossfield.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crossfield.com</a> | jobs@crossfield.com","time":1472760472,"type":"comment"}
