It doesn&#x27;t matter whether your resum√© says PHP or PhD: if you&#x27;re smart, empathetic and know some stuff, we want to work with you.<p>We have <i>many</i> established offices worldwide (pivotal.io&#x2F;locations) and more coming.<p>We&#x27;re broken into three main divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Cloud R&amp;D and Big Data.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i> helps clients to become better at product development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud R&amp;D</i> is where we build the best cloud platform available. We&#x27;re the majority contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. Our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i> and it&#x27;s <i>still</i> zooming up and to the right.<p>Except for upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform available.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is our suite of battled-hardened products, now open sourced. Greenplum tackles massive datasets with the comfort of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, donated as Apache Geode (incubating), is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, excellent benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong isn&#x27;t mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The NYC beer fridge has more IPA than I prefer but I guess that&#x27;s life in paradise.<p>Presently we&#x27;re hiring engineers in Atlanta, Beaverton, Beijing, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Dublin, London, New York, Palo Alto, Paris, San Francisco, Santa Monica, Seattle, Sydney, Toronto and Washington DC. Most of these are hiring designers and product managers. Other roles are being hired worldwide also.<p>To see our open jobs and apply directly, follow this referral URL: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;xiy346\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;xiy346</a><p>You can also email me at jchester+hn@pivotal.io to answer any questions.<p>Either of these helps me score one of our referral bonuses (did I mention our generous referral scheme?)<p>I may not be able to reply immediately, as I am just an engineer here.","time":1472744428,"type":"comment"}
