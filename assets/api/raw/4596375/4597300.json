We are using coffeescript and backbone for our front-end, with Django for the REST api. Most of the data in postgres and some in Mongo. Experience building scalable sites is a must, and experience with polyglot persistence and distributed systems architecture is a big plus.<p>You will join a closely knit team that has been flying under the radar with this product for 1 year already and it is starting to pick up a lot of steam. We are very well funded and have great strategic partners (VH1, MTV). As far as culture, we are very pragmatic when it comes to technology and we are obviously very passionate about music.<p>Our compensation is competitive, excellent benefits, and of course we offer stock options.
