We're looking for devops, python engineers and frontend (js/backbone) engineers.<p>Percolate is a very quickly growing SAAS company in NYC. We are building a tool that helps brands create content across social. What makes us unique is that we're the only platform that doesn't already assume a brand knows what to say. To help them figure that out we pull data from across the web and make recommendations on interesting content (whether their own or third-party) that might be interesting at any moment.<p>We're looking for backend (all levels) and frontend engineers (we run backbone.js alongside our RESTful API) to join the team (the company is 21, product team is currently at 12). On the backend, we're especially interested in folks with good experience working with lots of data and excited to build real-time systems (we run python).<p>Here's a few reasons why you should come work here: - You are gonna work in SOHO on Broadway - Your chance to work with big data - You come in early: We're only-and-a-half a year old - As we get bigger, you will be able to focus on what you are good at - We are all different and we love it - GPL compliant company - You choose your workstation - You choose your tools - No worries, free your mind: NY salary + medical + dental - No vacation policy - does not mean no vacation ;) - Company invests in you: Fly to PyCon and other conferences - We prefer quality over quantity: Focus on clean code and test coverage - Your voice will be heard<p>If you're interested email us at jobs@percolate.com. If you have any questions you can email me directly at noah@percolate.com\nThanks.","time":1349093454,"type":"comment"}
