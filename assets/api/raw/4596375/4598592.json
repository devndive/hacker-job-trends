We are looking for well rounded PHP developers, a MySQL DBA and a javascript specialist in advertising delivery platforms.<p>We have a great office in SoMa, a great culture (fun/creative/work-life balance++), an established, profitable and growing company (140 employees mostly in SF and Poznan, Poland). The SF engineering team is about 20 people. We are a large wiki hosting company (top 40 site in the US, 1B+ page views) based on Mediawiki.  In addition to just running our own thing, I'd like to find some people who are interested in re-inventing the wiki platform.  One of the down sides is working on mediawiki. :) One of the perks is being able to contribute code and ideas back to the Wikipedia Foundation.<p>Email me directly, or if you do go through our hiring page, mention HN or me in your cover letter and I'll definitely take a look at your resume.","time":1349116385,"type":"comment"}
