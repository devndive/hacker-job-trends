Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic's central, highly automated 'biocenter' in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We're building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.<p>We're looking for highly talented full-stack web developers as well as combined background EE/CS engineers for automation integration and development.  Experience reverse engineering USB based protocols is a plus.<p>We're a very small startup (you'd be #5), but well funded and have customers. You'd be able to work on interesting science and hard technology in a really small, all technical team with lots of freedom and resources.<p>A biology background is preferred but not strictly necessary for outstanding people. The codebase is mostly Ruby and Scala, with some Python.<p>max at transcriptic.com<p><a href=\"https://www.transcriptic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.transcriptic.com/</a>","time":1349105528,"type":"comment"}
