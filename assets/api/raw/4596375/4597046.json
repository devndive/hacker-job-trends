OUYA's building a small team that will create a new game platform: discovery of new games, a TV UI, eventually working on the Android NDK to improve game performance, a social layer, and... other stuff.<p>No titles environment, everyone works directly with the CEO. Other engineers from EA, Amazon, Pivotal, Motorola, etc. Almost everything we write could be open sourced.<p>You work independently, love to be wrong when a better idea comes along, play games, and maybe even backed our Kickstarter so we know you were in from the get-go. You know where the bodies are buried in Android, or can figure it out quick.<p>No time to write more. If you're interested, help us get to know you better with this every-question-optional get to know you...<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEdkcmFaWVJzclR2NV9kNkVXQ0Vsbmc6MA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEdkcmF...</a>","time":1349100784,"type":"comment"}
