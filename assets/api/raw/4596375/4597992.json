It's not time yet for us to publicize details of our technology, but do look carefully at what our team members have done in the past.<p>For the software engineering positions, we aren't looking for any specific domain expertise because what we're doing involves significant depth and breadth of computer science. The ability to context switch between a diverse range of things is the primary thing we care about. It's highly likely that a great programmer with experience on any platform and in any compiled programming language will find our work interesting, challenging, and rewarding. Examples of \"any\" would be one or more of C, C++, and Objective-C on one or more of Android, iOS, Linux, OS X, and Windows.","time":1349110121,"type":"comment"}
