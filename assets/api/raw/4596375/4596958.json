One that imports over 5TB of data every single day, and has alumni from Google, Intel, and Microsoft?<p>You might think I'm talking about some stealth-mode startup, but I'm talking about where I work: Two Sigma Investments. At our core, we're a technology company applying our talents to the domain of finance. We've created a system that combines artificial intelligence and keen human insight — a system that's constantly improving and advancing.<p>We're looking for a diverse set of technologists to join our team. Our challenges require mastery of areas such as kernel level development, machine learning, and distributed systems. Our team includes a Unix Lifetime Achievement winner, Putnam medalists, ACM Programming competition finalists, and International Mathematics Olympiad medalists. We are proud of our individual pedigrees, but even prouder of our teamwork.<p>We tend to hire people with at least a bachelor’s degree in a technical or quantitative field and experience with C or languages that target the JVM, but we are open-minded in our search for critical thinkers who are passionate about technology. We analyze the data-rich domain of finance, but financial experience is not a requirement. We hope to hear from you!<p>Dave Hahn \ndave.hahn@twosigma.com \n<a href=\"http://www.twosigma.com/careers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.twosigma.com/careers.html</a>","time":1349099807,"type":"comment"}
