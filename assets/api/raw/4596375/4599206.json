We're the startup behind Paper, an iPad app for freeform writing/sketching/drawing.<p>Paper has done well so far. Among other things, it won this year's Apple Design Award for iPad, it's had nearly 3 million downloads, and it's used and loved by creatives at top-notch companies everywhere, including Apple, Nike, Pixar, and more.<p>But Paper is just the beginning for us. Our goal is to bring creation tools into the post-PC era, and we think there's a huge opportunity there. Mobile and tablets are changing everything.<p>We like to say that Paper is “where ideas begin”; we're now building a service to “bring ideas together”. Think something like a GitHub for ideas and creations. We have a small team of great developers and designers spanning iOS and web, but we’re looking for 2-3 more developers to join us. That’s where we hope you’ll come in.<p>The role is flexible depending on your passions and expertise. Check out our jobs page for full details:<p><a href=\"http://www.fiftythree.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.fiftythree.com/jobs</a><p>You'll be just our fifth engineer, so you'll help set the tone for our culture, process, and workflow. And if we succeed, you'll help shape our company's future, too.<p>If this sounds interesting to you and you think you fit the bill, send us an email to jobs@fiftythree.com. We look forward to hearing from you!","time":1349123707,"type":"comment"}
