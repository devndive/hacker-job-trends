The core application code is in portable C++, and we have front-ends in Cocoa and .Net, with Qt frontends in the works. There is a lot of crypto and experience working with cryptographic libraries is a huge plus.<p>Requirements:<p>* Plenty of C++ programming experience, especially systems code. Any platform is okay (Windows / Mac / Linux), as long as you are not biased against working on another platforms if required. \n* Great object oriented design and API design skills.<p>Other good-to-have skills:<p><pre><code>   * Ruby on Rails \n   * In-browser cryptography (JS crypto, Native Client experience a plus)\n   * UI programming -- Qt / Cocoa / .Net\n   * iOS / Android experience\n   * Desktop application design / testing experience\n</code></pre>\nOf course, we're not looking for someone with all of the above skills, but you must be a fast learner and someone who has fun writing code and working in a startup environment.","time":1349109047,"type":"comment"}
