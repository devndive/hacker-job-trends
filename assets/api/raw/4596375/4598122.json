We make thousands of developers more productive by creating better developer tools that allows them move quickly.<p>We have an incredibly fast, auto-scaling PaaS using EC2 and some pretty hardcore, low-level tech. It's all written in Clojure, exposed as a REST API, with the front-end written in Less, Haml and Coffeescript.<p>We're pretty small and just started to grow (we were two people a few weeks ago, about to be 4, hopefully 5). We want to have a very transparent company, with a flat organization, and need self-directed folks who play well with others.<p>Happy to answer questions too.
