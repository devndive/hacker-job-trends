Since being founded in 2015, we have developed a solution built on collaborative mobile robots and cloud-based enterprise software. Our solution is half the cost for 2-3x the efficency of manual, cart pick operations.<p>Our culture is built on trust, smarts, and collaboration. We have a West Coast vibe with Northeast drive. As a team, we encourage open discussion about particularly challenging problems.<p>Currently developing in Javascript, C++, Angular, and Python. Commitment to rigorous testing &amp; validation practices (we write lots of unit tests). Experience with databases, supply chain applications, and Robot Operating System (ROS) is a bonus but not required.","time":1507310430,"type":"comment"}
