We&#x27;re 100% BSD-licensed open source (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;getsentry&#x2F;sentry\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;getsentry&#x2F;sentry</a>). We&#x27;re mostly Python and JS, with a dash of Rust. Sentry is deployed at just about every major technology company (teams at Dropbox, Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest, Twitter, Atlassian, Microsoft, Apple, etc).<p>While Sentry is over 40 people, the growth team is small (3 people!) but focused. All of us are technical (everyone commits code), analytical (you measure and present your experiments), and organized (we are our own PMs). In people, we prefer action over pontification, honesty over polish. If you like developer tools, open source, and experimenting with SaaS economics, message me or apply below.
