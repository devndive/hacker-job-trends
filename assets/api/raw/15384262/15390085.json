The field of NLP parsing has been moving slowly for the last 20 years because of its utter dependence on labelled training data such as the Penn Treebank. In my research I&#x27;ve discovered a way to circumvent that limitation, by building and evaluating sentence parsers using only a large amount of raw text data. Even though its still in the early stages of development, the parser works quite well, makes more refined grammatical distinctions than any other widely available parser, and was built without any labelled training data. I&#x27;ve spent the last couple of years working on my own, and now that I&#x27;m confident the approach is valid, I&#x27;m looking to build up a team. I&#x27;m flexible on exact qualifications, but here are general blueprint of what I&#x27;m looking for:<p>- Strong programming and software architecture skills<p>- Good background in math, statistics, machine learning, information theory<p>- Deep interest in language and linguistics<p>The software is built in Java, Postgres, and AWS, but I won&#x27;t ask for any specific technology as long as you have demonstrable programming skill.<p>I have a nontraditional, minimalist and cockroachy business plan that won&#x27;t be for everyone, but I can promise you that if I get rich you will also. I&#x27;m happy to talk more about the specifics in person. Email me at daniel dot burfoot at gmail.","time":1507003946,"type":"comment"}
