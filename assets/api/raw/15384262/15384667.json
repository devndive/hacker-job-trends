We are a VoD company with a focus on bringing the best films to our customers around the globe. What sets us apart is true editorial credibility in the film world, and a strategy building social traction with a cinephile audience before putting Studio content deals in place. That time has now come. We are at an inflection point where we will massively scale the subscriber base.<p>The product is a streaming service and social network currently available on the web, iOS, tvOS, Android mobile and Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, PlayStation, Samsung Smart TVs, and several TV&#x27;s and set top boxes. It is built primarily of Ruby, Rails, React &amp; Redux and the usual client-side VoD frameworks. We have developed our own custom-built CDN tuned to deliver a better QoS than off-the-shelf vendors can provide.<p>Join our product team as software engineer overall, and play a significant role in defining the architecture of our application as we scale. Strong ruby, rails, javascript, react and redux skills are ideal, though this can be substituted by strong web and backend development skills in similar languages and architectures. VoD and client-side video app development are a bonus but not required. You will have significant opportunity to define your own position and work on any area of our technology where you can add value.<p>If you are interested please contact me by email at fkeen@mubi.com.","time":1506958939,"type":"comment"}
