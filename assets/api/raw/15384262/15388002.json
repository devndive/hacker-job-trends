The app allows people to listen to music together (even if they&#x27;re not in the same location) and interact throughout. The iOS app (written primarily in Swift) is publicly available and has increasingly good traction.  We&#x27;re working hard evolving the app with many new features.  We are also just starting up development of Android (primarily in Kotlin), so that&#x27;s basically a ground up project.<p>This is a small team doing big things! Official hiring email is jobs@playlist.com, but better yet, email me directly at tango at playlist.com if you want to chat informally about what we&#x27;re doing and why you&#x27;d want to work with us first (I&#x27;m the hiring person and currently lead iOS eng).<p>Thanks!","time":1506978729,"type":"comment"}
