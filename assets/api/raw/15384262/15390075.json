Fathom Computing is building an optical computer that replaces electricity in processors with light, allowing super-parallel operations. Our optical processors will allow training of human-brain-scale neural networks with unprecedented performance. We’re a venture backed startup based in Palo Alto, CA.\nWe’re seeking talented software engineers with strong interests in machine learning and an understanding of neural networks or background in programming in some area of science.\nYou will give programming support to the optics team including developing sophisticated ray and physical optics models for new prototype systems and help us benchmark different designs to simulate effects of our various system features on training state of the art algorithms. So if you have excellent programming skills and experience in building APIs (Python, C&#x2F;C++, etc) as well as a deep passion and fundamental understanding of design, algorithms, and data structures please contact us!<p>Apply here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fathomcomputing.recruitee.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fathomcomputing.recruitee.com&#x2F;</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fathomcomputing.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fathomcomputing.com&#x2F;</a>","time":1507003826,"type":"comment"}
