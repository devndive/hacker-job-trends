We&#x27;re creating the perfect combination of an ETL tool and a spreadsheet, wrapped in an intuitive and highly visual interface. It makes data easy to import, eliminates the need for complex formulas, and everything is automatically repeatable whenever incoming data changes. Our customers find they&#x27;re able to save multiple hours per week by automating previously manual work, while also finding new, revenue generating ways to use their data.\nWe’re a very small but quickly growing and highly technical team, recently backed by some of the top VCs in the Valley.<p>We’re looking for full-stack, front-end, and back-end engineers to join us.
