Think of it like continuous integration, but for mechanical engineers. We&#x27;re looking for software engineers with interest in computational geometry, computational physics&#x2F;engineering, and building elegant user experiences for complicated technical software.<p>Our stack: * C++ for performance-critical finite element code * Ruby on Rails for server code * React + Three.js + regl on the frontend.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone who is proficient in at least one of the layers of our stack, and who wants to work with the full stack. We prefer previous C++ experience, but will also gladly bring you up to speed if you have a solid foundation in software engineering.<p>We&#x27;d love to hear from you!
