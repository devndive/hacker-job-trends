Sync Platform houses all of the core sync logic that makes Dropbox tick, from the core sync engine itself to the metadata stores on the back-end and the sync protocol we speak between them. We&#x27;re rebuilding significant pieces of our entire stack in preparation for the next ten years (as we&#x27;ve already been around for ten). These are some of the biggest changes to sync since the company was founded.<p>We&#x27;re looking for motivated senior-level engineers. We write mostly in Rust, Go and Python. We do a lot of distributed systems work, so expertise there is a bonus but by no means a requirement. Keeping our user&#x27;s data safe and consistent is sacrosanct so most important is a strong attention to detail to ensure that we do right by our users. Equally important is an ability to work constructively in an diverse, equitable and inclusive environment.<p>Reach out to bn@dropbox.com if interested!","time":1506969102,"type":"comment"}
