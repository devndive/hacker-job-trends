Voltus builds virtual power plants by aggregating large industrial and commercial customers, pooling their energy resources (including demand response, solar, and back-up generators), and bringing them into the energy market. Along the way, we help big energy consumers make money by managing their energy cleaner and smarter.<p>We are hiring a few positions with some constants--see link at bottom. Our backend is primarily Python&#x2F;Flask, with Redis and Postgres, and some Go&#x2F;Lua sprinkled in. Frontend is primarily React&#x2F;Redux. We build and install our own metering and control hardware, and there are opportunities to dive into hardware&#x2F;firmware development and manufacturing if you&#x27;re so inclined. You should be interested in learning the nuts and bolts of the energy industry--how energy is bought, sold, transmitted, generated, and consumed.<p>Check out our jobs page at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.voltus.co&#x2F;join-our-team&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.voltus.co&#x2F;join-our-team&#x2F;</a> or email me directly--my email is in my profile.","time":1506958018,"type":"comment"}
