Right now we&#x27;ve got a couple of development roles to fill. One is a senior role (4+ years) backend heavy with python experience, and ideally Django. This role can be filled in SF or we&#x27;re open to REMOTE candidates, particularly those with experience working remotely. The other position is a front-end focused (but still full stack) role. 2-3 years of Javascript and some ReactJS, with some backend experience (any stack, some RDBMS&#x2F;SQL). That role we&#x27;re hiring for the SF team locally.<p>Stack is Python&#x2F;Django&#x2F;MySQL&#x2F;ReactJS&#x2F;Elasticsearch&#x2F;Redis&#x2F;AWS. Team culture is awesome. Engineering team is ~30% remote. High empathy, low ego. Lots of interactions with passionate users, and generally in the company of people who care a lot about the quality of the product experience.<p>Apply online or reach out to me directly if you have any questions or are curious! I&#x27;m always happy to chat with folks about healthcare, startups, whatever. Contact info&#x27;s in profile.","time":1506958080,"type":"comment"}
