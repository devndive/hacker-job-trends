We believe that renters shouldn&#x27;t engage with technology only to search for their next home or apartment rental. We believe that you should be able to walk into an open house or appointment, pull out your phone, and make a binding application and offer for that unit right there. This is how the next generation of the rental market will function, and Zumper — with a unique twinned B2B and Consumer approach — is leading the way.<p>We are hiring for a Lead Front End Engineer with a strong portfolio of experience using client-side MVC frameworks and managing engineers. You’ll manage the development of features across Zumper’s Tenant and Professional web apps (Zumper &amp; Zumper Pro) as well as our new site, Padmapper (www.padmapper.com).  You will be heading up a small but nimble tight knit team that is focused on delivering an incredible consumer experience across desktop and mobile web.<p>We work primarily with two stacks:\n- Angular v1 with Python&#x2F;Django backend\n- React and Redux with Node Express<p>This role also comes with the opportunity to graduate into our Head of Frontend.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, feel free to ping me kari@zumper.com","time":1507655622,"type":"comment"}
