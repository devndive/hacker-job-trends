You might&#x27;ve seen our billboards on the 101 or bus stops around SF. In short, we help companies engage with their mobile users. In practice, we let marketers create very granularly targeted campaigns, and we handle the delivery, reporting, and optimization for them (for example, think of a lifecycle campaign to prevent churn, or a one-off campaign to send a discount to a specific set of users).<p>I lead the data team that serves as a foundation for user targeting, analysis, optimizations. We ingest and process billions of events daily, and have a lot of interesting infrastructure work happening.<p>We are a midsize company (~140 total, ~40 engineers), B2B, series C, with real sustainable revenue, and growing very fast. My team is 4 people now and looking to grow to 7 (1 PM, 2 Software Engineers (Backend or Fullstack)). I&#x27;m also happy to put you in touch with other teams within the company.<p>Apply with the link below and <i>do</i> send me a note to rodrigo at leanplum dot com.
