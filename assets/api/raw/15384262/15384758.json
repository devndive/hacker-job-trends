Ex-employees have described our office as &quot;quiet and collegial&quot;.<p>The integrated IT&#x2F;Ops team is looking for a jack-of-all-trades sysadmin and a junior version thereof. We mostly run Debian Linux on servers and MacOS on laptops&#x2F;desktops. If  \nit&#x27;s mission critical, we manage it ourselves, from DNS through load balancing to web servers, databases and storage. We&#x27;ve been committed to reducing workload via automated configuration management for a long time -- so long, in fact, that we wrote our own deployment system and GPL&#x27;d it. Now we&#x27;ve moved systems automation over to Chef.<p>Five or more years of Linux sysadmin experience, please, one or more for the junior role. Having decent programming chops is good, especially in Python or Ruby. Wider experience is better. Excellent written English is necessary.<p>You must be clever, competent, and kind.<p>We offer a competitive salary, fully paid healthcare premiums and three weeks of vacation plus holidays. Office hours are very flexible and partial work-from-home can be arranged.<p>Process: resume screening, phone interview, in-person interview with practical test, decision.<p>Please send cover letters and resumes to future@smartleaf.com in plain text or PDF. In your cover letter, please tell us about an interesting technical problem that you have solved. Feel free to ask me questions, email in my profile.","time":1506959402,"type":"comment"}
