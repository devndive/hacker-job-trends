Our goal is to develop brain-machine interfaces so useful and so safe that ordinary people will choose to get them like they get a smartphone. Neuralink&#x27;s aim is to bring humans and machines closer so software forms a true extension of ourselves, rather than something separate we interact with slowly and awkwardly.<p>We are hiring for a fairly diverse set of technical backgrounds. There is a ton of software to write ranging from firmware to surgical robotics control to an experiment management web app. Experience with C++ for robotics is especially desirable. Culturally, we place a premium on diligence, care and thoroughness rather than trying out every latest cool framework.<p>jobs@neuralink.com","time":1506966512,"type":"comment"}
