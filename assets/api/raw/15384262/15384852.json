We analyze billions of requests daily using one of the biggest Big Data clusters in Europe (110 local servers). We love automation, so we use tools like Puppet and Cloudera on a daily basis, and always try to minimize the manual interactions. Some of the new technologies that we are using right now are Spark, Hadoop, Kafka and Docker.<p>We are looking for a Senior DevOps Engineer who will take up the challenge of updating our architecture to continue improving our real time functionality. As a Senior DevOps Engineer, you will help the team with maintaining, growing and optimizing the existing fleet of Linux servers. Furthermore, you will architect the infrastructure behind our applicationâ€™s backend, creating scalable services, frameworks and storage solutions in PHP, Java, Python and Go. You will be challenged with the amounts of data&#x2F;requests we manage to process daily, and upcoming projects which will put even more pressure and require new approaches and infrastructure stacks in the future.<p>Apart from the challenges mentioned above, there are a few things we can offer apart from those listed in the job description. From the company side, you can expect a lot of freedom, trust and flexibility. From our DevOps wizard you can expect professionalism and reliability from eye to eye level. He is a person who is really motivated, committed and keeps up with new technologies by visiting meet ups and conferences.<p>We are around 30 people in the company, half of the team works on tech positions. 15 employees are male, the other 15 female. The ADEX is based in Berlin with a small customer support team based in Hamburg. As we are a small company, we have many 1-person teams and we would like to have at least two people working on the same team, that&#x27;s why the position is open. We are pretty flexible and chilled, and very tech- and product-focused. We work in a cutting-edge industry, so we encourage our employees to try new technologies, go to meet-ups, workshops and conferences. We are not afraid of trying and failing because we strongly believe in learning from mistakes.<p>If you have any questions, please get in touch: elena@theadex.com","time":1506959961,"type":"comment"}
