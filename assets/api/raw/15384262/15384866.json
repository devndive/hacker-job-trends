Instead of spending $10,000 to $20,000 on a coding bootcamp, come work with us, work on real software projects and <i>make</i> money.  While the pay rate is relatively low, compared to spending money and what you will learn it is a great opportunity for anyone wanting to break into software development.<p>We are looking for people with some aptitude for computers and programming, but not necessarily any experience.<p>You will be learning basic web development with Rails and Javascript (node.js and potentially Vue.js)<p>At this time we are only accepting interns from the USA.
