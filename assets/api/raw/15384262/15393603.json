Whether someone needs a handyman, house cleaner, mover or delivery person, TaskRabbit delights clients by matching the right skilled person in minutes. On the other side of the marketplace we help our Taskers earn a living by setting their own prices, defining their working hours, and give them control to help people when and how they want in the most supportive marketplace.<p>You&#x27;ll be a member of our engineering team, helping us build out the web applications that drive our business. We have applications for clients to hire taskers, for taskers to register with the platform, and for our internal users to administer the service. We use React.js on the frontend, and Rails on the backend. We&#x27;re looking for both a DevOps lead and  a full stack engineer but would be thrilled to hire a competent front-end engineer who has aspirations to learn Rails someday.
