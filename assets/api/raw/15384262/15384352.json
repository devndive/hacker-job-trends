Our solution pulls threat information (both our own and via external APIs) into a graph and enables real-time collaboration and sharing of the information on the graph.<p>What we&#x27;re looking for: We&#x27;re looking for a mid&#x2F;advanced front-end developer to take over development of our sites UI (we&#x27;re in-housing development of the site after contracting it out for about a year). The front-end is built with React&#x2F;Microcosm&#x2F;Material&#x2F;Vis.js, and it talks to our backend using a mix of REST and WebSockets. Ideally, the person we&#x27;re looking for would be comfortable doing both the React programming side of things as well as the HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;layout work. There would also be some design work as we roll out new features to the site.<p>Perks of the job: early round shares, competitive salary, 401k, &amp; healthcare benefits. Also, we work from home a lot and our focus is on getting the work done, not on attendance or face time.<p>A bit about us: We are a pre-A-round startup. We have a working product and paying customers, so we&#x27;re in a good spot financially. We are based in Alexandria, VA but do a lot of working from home, and tend to meet up in Alexandria once a week or so. Also, since we have an existing contracting relationship for our UI development, we&#x27;re very flexible about start dates for this position.<p>If you are at all interested, please send me a message: aaron@kingandunion.com","time":1506956974,"type":"comment"}
