It can connect to 81 grocery chains like Walmart, Safeway, Kroger etc. and automatically download every purchase a user makes into the app. It uses NLP to match each product purchased to recipe ingredients. Over 1,000,000 products are matched to 1,000,000 recipes with 90% accuracy.\nI’ve built Cooklist over the last 8 months and it’s now live in private beta. Hundreds of users are participating in the development process. 10,000+ purchases have been downloaded in the last week. You can see a demo video at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cooklist.co\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cooklist.co</a><p>We are looking to bring on someone to lead the development of the mobile apps.
