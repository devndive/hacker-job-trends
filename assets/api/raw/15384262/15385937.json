We have a mix of self-hosted and AWS systems and are pretty well setup but have had some folks leave for greater things and need to shore up the team. If those aren&#x27;t your thing then we&#x27;re also going to be hiring for other positions later in the year, just shoot me an email (my username at gmail) and let me know! <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kiva.org&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kiva.org&#x2F;careers</a>","time":1506965679,"type":"comment"}
