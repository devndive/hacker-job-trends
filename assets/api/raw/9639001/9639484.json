Especially when you can completely influence its journey. The vision is to change the way people write web applications. Enough said.<p>At Dhi, you will be working on an Artificial Intelligent assistant to help &quot;developers&quot; build web applications. A good knowledge of Machine Learning is a must. You should know your way around Torch, Theano - and basically be able to start programming from day one. A good solid maths background would be a serious plus. If your work is in NLP or CNN or RNN we want to hear from you.<p>Apart from ML , if you have some background in Javascript or building web applications that that would be even better.  You can contact us at info at dhi dot io.","time":1433173330,"type":"comment"}
