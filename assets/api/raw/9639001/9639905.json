We’re starting with a focus on the $50 billion personal care segment. Personal care manufacturers and traditional retailers are neither building brands nor  merchandising experiences which cater to the uniquely differentiated needs of black, latino and asian consumers --- three of America’s fastest growing and most culturally influential demographic groups.<p>We&#x27;re inventing a new class of commerce company that will build beloved consumer brands, will win on customer experience, and will win on technology.<p>Our stack is Rails, Postgres, Sidekiq, Rspec, and a few new(er), exciting things in the works.
