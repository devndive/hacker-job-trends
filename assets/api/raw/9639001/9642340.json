We unlock hard-to-access public records data in the far reaches of the global internet, with results automatically translated for you.<p>We are currently a close-knit team of 25, with an engineering team of 10. Our approach is nimble and responsive, with close integration between sales and tech. Challenges for our developers include managing terabytes of data, crawling obscure corners of the web, teaching machines to analyse and index all this data, and helping users to make sense of it with great workflow and design. We are particularly interested at the moment in developers with some team leadership experience (doesn&#x27;t have to be very much).<p>Turn up early, leave early, work from home - far more flexible than a corporate job. As long as you get your work done we don’t care where you do it from. Our offices are located five minutes’ walk from the Angel tube station. It’s a bright, airy space equipped with free food, showers and fresh towels, aeron chairs, and great people.<p>We are able to offer to sponsor visas and pay relocation expenses for some candidates. Remote working is certainly possible, but we have a strong preference for people who can spend at least part of their time each week in London - ask for details.<p>Please include GitHub profile or similar with your inquiry.","time":1433194622,"type":"comment"}
