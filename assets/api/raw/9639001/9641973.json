KickBack is looking for a technical leader with proficiencies in modern DevOps tools like Chef, CI&#x2F;CD (Bamboo), AWS, Terraform, Ruby, Python, and Networking. KRS has a pretty complex application hosting environment so if you want to cover a lot of technologies quickly, we might be a good fit. For example, one day you might be working on an ELK Stack, the next Hadoop and the third-day announcing new subnets over BGPv4&#x2F;6 for a new BGP Anycast datacenter deployment.<p>KickBack Rewards Systems is a privately held company founded in 1999 by Pat Lewis that specializes in customer specific marketing and payments for over 1000 US clients. We bootstrapped and we&#x27;re now profitable. We&#x27;re building a nation-wide coalition loyalty program and already have thousands of clients and thousands of locations on the program. Our clients include a half-dozen Fortune 50 companies - one that is an anchor partner in our coalition loyalty program. As the CTO, I need some help! You will be joining a medium sized team of 13 developers which includes only one other DevOps Engineer. If you are interested in this position my contact information is under my profile.
