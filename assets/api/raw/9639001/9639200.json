Instead, Heap automatically captures every user interaction in your app. This lets our customers analyze data instantly and retroactively, without writing code.<p>We&#x27;re eager to meet all types of engineers, regardless of where you live or what tools you use day-to-day. Your creativity and intelligence are much more important to us than your experience with our stack.<p>How we work:<p>Happy Customers &gt; Perfect Code. We&#x27;re out to solve real problems for real people, not to write slick code or play with the hippest frameworks. We spend a lot of time thinking through how to build new features, but the goal is always for the implementation to be maintainable, not for it to be &quot;pure.&quot;<p>Vision &gt; GroupThink. A big idea starts in one person&#x27;s head. We make sure he or she has the space to develop it into a fully-articulated thought before we iterate on it as a group. No brainstorming, no design-by-committee -- these produce watered-down initiatives and incremental ideas.<p>Writing &gt; Talking. Instead of sitting in meetings, we develop our ideas in writing, asynchronously. Written proposals encourage clearer thought and more thorough deliberation. Our plans are always documented and our culture is remote-friendly.<p>We&#x27;d love to hear from you at jobs@heapanalytics.com.","time":1433171633,"type":"comment"}
