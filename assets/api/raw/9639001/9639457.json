The company is profitable, with a paying customer base of 18,000 companies, and recently raised a small series A round. The current product team consists of 8 people, all Atlanta-based. We&#x27;re looking to add two or three more to help us build out the platform faster. Current tech stack is Ruby, Rails, AngularJS, Postgres, and Redis.<p>Senior Software Engineer - Looking for full-stack engineers who can help us expand the platform. Upcoming projects include refactoring key components into services, building out automated call scoring using machine classifiers, deeper integrations with other services, and improving our analytics tools.<p>Senior Mobile Engineer - We have aspirations of building native mobile applications, but nobody to do it. Looking for someone with experience building apps from the ground up, part of which will be scoping what features the app should include. No strong opinions on pure native vs hybrid vs Cordova vs Xamarin, but regardless there will eventually be some WebRTC components. Prefer to start with iOS, as that&#x27;s where most of our customers are.<p>More at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.callrail.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.callrail.com&#x2F;careers</a>, or email me directly.","time":1433173192,"type":"comment"}
