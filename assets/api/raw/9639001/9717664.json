{"by":"jbergstroem","id":9717664,"parent":9639001,"text":"Pageload - Remote - Full time<p>Pageload (pageload.io) is a new service that aims to make websites faster by acting as a transparent proxy between the origin and a CDN. Pageload is based in Sydney, Australia but has a global customer base and aims to be a global service when publicly launched. Pageload recenly aquired venture captial to accelerate the global rollout. We strongly believe that everyone who wants to work with us does it because it&#x27;s an area they like to spend time in, be it jpeg headers or shaving cpu cycles off css minifacation. We don&#x27;t have requirements as to when or from where you work -- that&#x27;s most often best decided by yourself.<p>Our platform is [at the moment] mostly built with nodejs.<p>We are (currently) looking for two positions:<p>- dev ops: we&#x27;re looking for someone that wants to help us build a globally distributed, fault-tolerant and auto scaling containerised platform. Since pageload&#x27;s job is to make other websites faster, reducing latency in every step of the stack will be your highest priority. Experience with amazon, docker and nginx is required. Experience in writing javascript&#x2F;nodejs is a strong plus since you most likely also will be contributing to the backend of pageload. Varnish is also a plus.<p>- backend engineer: your main job will be to expand the functionality of pageload in terms of what we can optimise (for size or speed) as well as generally improving the application, its resiliency and infrastructure. A strong background in javascript&#x2F;nodejs as well as experience with C is preferred since that&#x27;s where you will do most of your work (unless you can convince the team there&#x27;s a better tool for the job). Experience with Amazon infrastructure is also a plus.<p>Feel free to shoot us an email to [jobs at pageload.io] or ping me on IRC (jbergstroem@freenode) if you&#x27;d like to talk. Looking forward to hearing from you.","time":1434346119,"type":"comment"}
