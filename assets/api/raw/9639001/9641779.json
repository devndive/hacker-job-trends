We believe that although tablets have enormous potential to transform note-taking in school and in business, they&#x27;ve failed to catch on because pen on paper is still good enough.  We have some innovative ideas that we think will push electronic note-taking from being &quot;cool but kinda gimmicky&quot; to being indispensable.<p>We&#x27;re currently just the two founders: two engineers who have founded successful startups together in the past. We&#x27;re well funded and have distribution in place if we deliver.<p>What&#x27;s in it for you:<p>● Greenfield development and the chance to do it right, right from the start<p>● Solid compensation in upper quartile for SFBay<p>● Participation in the entire product, and ownership of your part<p>● The chance to have your work used by millions of people<p>We&#x27;d love to talk to you if:<p>● You have deep experience in either Android or iOS development<p>● You care deeply about your craft<p>● You have broad knowledge of other technologies, because you&#x27;re a curious person<p>● You care about having your software used by real people for real reasons<p>I&#x27;m one of the founders - shoot me an email at rod@distilledlabs.co","time":1433189444,"type":"comment"}
