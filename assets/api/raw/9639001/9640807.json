It&#x27;s all papers and fax machines now, and we&#x27;re going to bust it wide open.<p>About you: You’ve got 3-6 years experience building web apps. You’re interested in owning a product, everything from calling clients to wireframes to writing code and analyzing metrics. 2+ years with rails is ideal. We are looking at miles and miles of green field, so be pumped about building new things that will immediately go into paying customers&#x27; hands.<p>More about us: We&#x27;re growing fast (double-digit month-over-month). We do SaaS for non-technical users. Everyday, our clients call and email to say that we&#x27;re making them happy, and that feels great. We’re becoming ubiquitous in one segment of the market and we’re looking to hire another core engineer to help us expand further.<p>Details: Our office is in downtown San Francisco, right off of  Union Square. We prefer to hire for onsite. But if you want to start remote and move towards relocation, we&#x27;d be open to that too. (Our UX guy did just that very thing.) We offer health insurance and generous vacation. Compensation will be salary plus meaningful equity. As an early engineer you&#x27;ll be shaping this company.<p>More details: pivotal, git, rails 3&amp;4, Postgres, slack, opsworks, AWS, jquery, balsamiq, coffee (as in... you know... code fuel)<p>Send an email to jobs@snapdocs.com telling us about yourself.<p>Please include a resume and a link to github if your profile is informative.","time":1433181989,"type":"comment"}
