Out of this passion, we&#x27;ve developed the worldâ€™s first wearable power meter for runners that provides insight into their running technique and performance.<p>For the iOS development, we use Swift primarily. But we want you to have deep understanding of Objective-C and the best practices of iOS programming. Good sense of design is bonus.\nWe also want you to be an endurance runner, or a triathlete, or at least to have the passion about running.<p>Relocating to Boulder during the internship is required. But you know what? If you like running, this is pretty much your dream place. You get tons of opportunities to run and train with LOTS of elite athletes who are Stryd ambassadors here.<p>If interested, please send an email to stryd@stryd.com","time":1433184833,"type":"comment"}
