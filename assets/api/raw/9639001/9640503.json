We’ve powered some of the most successful and well-known launches, working with companies like Lily, Soylent, Lytro, Navdy, Eero, Plastc, and many more.<p>We are a small “startup within a startup” team which grew from an experimental side project at Tilt, and many of us have backgrounds as former founders. We’re able to move extremely quickly, while also enjoying the benefits and support of the larger engineering organization and Tilt technology and brand.<p>We&#x27;ve migrated some of our user flows to a React + Flux stack and are looking for experienced front-end developers to help take this to the next level and own a few of the key experiences. Currently, our primary focus is around the admin dashboard and embeddable checkout flows. We’re looking for team members who pair strong technical skills with an innate desire to work closely with customers to drive the product forward. Beyond our own areas of expertise, we take great pride in being well-rounded, full-stack developers (which sometimes encompasses non-technical parts of the “stack”).<p>Please apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tilt.com&#x2F;learn&#x2F;jobs?gh_jid=62904&amp;gh_src=fmsw7p\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tilt.com&#x2F;learn&#x2F;jobs?gh_jid=62904&amp;gh_src=fmsw7p</a>.","time":1433179844,"type":"comment"}
