TrueJob is a small, two person startup looking to bring on another ruby on rails developer to join the founding team. Our goal is to build a job search platform that helps both job seekers and employers find each other easier, using machine learning algorithms and analytics.<p>We&#x27;ve got some great tech behind the scenes, so we need a rails developer who&#x27;s not afraid of working with new things - from ElasticSearch to ReactJS, RabbitMQ and more.<p>Interested &#x2F; have questions?
