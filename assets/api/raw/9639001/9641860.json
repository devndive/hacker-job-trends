We build applications that push the envelope when it comes to throughput, latency and resiliency.<p>· We are building distributed systems that deal with actor-based concurrency, reactive programming, distributed in-memory data grids, an messaging that goes beyond plain JMS; we fully expect to participate in shaping the future of financial technology stacks<p>· These days the majority of our server-side projects are JVM-based, but you can still find anything from Node.js to niche financial vendor packages; we’ve done everything from C++ to Python in the past and from CEP stacks to tick databases<p>· The ideal candidate will hit the ground running with the typical Java or Scala JVM ecosystem stack (spring and its subprojects, guice, guava, maven, hibernate, jetty, etc)<p>· We know that the technology landscape changes every few years, and we expect to retool continuously<p>· We have a track record for picking up other technologies along the whole development stack, including front-end and other non-JVM ecosystems<p>· In most cases, we get to work with our clients in iterative, project-based engagements, where self-organizing and focused teams move quickly to build innovative solutions for the client.<p>In addition to server-side, we are looking for senior Web UI developers. If you come from a strong OOP background, have an engineering mindset (we are not hacking things together or building algorithms in isolation—we build real systems, and we treat software as a craft), and are passionate about delivering quality code, we want to hear from you.<p>- Alexandra \nalexandra.kislevitz@lab49.com","time":1433190220,"type":"comment"}
