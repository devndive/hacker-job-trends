The internet is full of bad guys trying to trick unsuspecting users and make a quick buck. Our mission is simple: Clean up the internet. We&#x27;re a small company and the only way we can deliver on this mission is if everyone we hire is talented, passionate, and committed to doing things the right way.<p>We do a lot of web crawling to trace the flow of web traffic, or identify places where their brand is being used incorrectly or inappropriately in specific offers, free form text, or even images. Directing a crawl against big chunks of the web and filtering the results to find the needle in the internet haystack has many challenges, and certainly puts our core work in the &quot;Big Data&quot; realm.<p>We&#x27;re looking for an experienced engineer who is a strong individual contributor but also wants to share their experience with some extremely capable but more junior team members. We’re very collaborative, and our engineers are some of the best communicating people around, because we appreciate that even if you can solve a problem well, being able to communicate about it is just as important.\nThe strong developer we’re seeking will have the foundations to easily adapt to a new stack, so we’re not looking for specific skill buzzwords. Experience with Python, AWS, and non-relational data storage would help you ramp up faster, but we’re willing to invest the time if you come with the right stuff but not the same stack.<p>If this sounds worth having a conversation about, please drop us a line at jobs@brandverity.com","time":1433184174,"type":"comment"}
