Founded by two Thiel Fellows, REX just closed its first (not yet announced) financing round, and is posting here on Hacker News about 2 weeks before we will be looking elsewhere. Competitive salary offering and equity will be offered as we are now hiring our first ~5 engineers, with three positions listed below. We&#x27;re looking for people who are excited about the possibilities of new semiconductor startups, processor architectures and making the worlds best chip, and the positions below are not all encompassing... if you are interested in revolutionizing the semiconductor space, and excite about making a completely new processor from the ground up (with the full resources to go and do so), please send an email to thomas [at] rexcomputing.com !<p>Feel free to ask any other questions here! Our website is relatively vague, but I&#x27;m happy to answer most questions here, and a lot more over coffee!<p>Also note that the titles are not final, and as we are building a team from scratch, our early engineers will be forming the company around them.<p>REX Computing | Compiler Developer | San Francisco Bay Area | On site ; Remote] | Full Time | Citizen | LLVM ; Compilers ; Backend<p>REX Computing | RTL&#x2F;Verilog Engineer | San Francisco Bay Area | On site ; Remote] | Full Time | Citizen | RTL ; Verilog ; VHDL ; ASIC ; FPGA<p>REX Computing | VLSI&#x2F;Digital Chip Design Engineer | San Francisco Bay Area | On site ; Remote] | Full Time | Citizen | FPGA ; ASIC ; Synopsys ; Cadence<p>metafriendly","time":1433171461,"type":"comment"}
