We&#x27;re a Madrid based start up and we&#x27;re looking for software engineers to expand our team.<p>To give you a high level overview, our Clojure platform runs on AWS that serves as a &quot;central server&quot; for other components such as a back-office web app, public website, kiosks, mobile apps (Android and iOS), etc. The kiosk is a ClojureScript&#x2F;Om web application interacting with a local web server. In the  back-office web app we show events as they arrive into the central server given an overview of what&#x27;s going on in the whole system.<p>- Some of the interesting problems we&#x27;re working on:<p><pre><code>    * System modularity\n    * Data security in the kiosks\n    * Unreliable communication with a central server over weak links (mobile networks)\n    * Kiosk offline support (and all its complexity, e.g. data synchronization)\n    * Kiosk communication with hardware components (designed and developed by the &quot;Hardware Team&quot;)\n    * etc\n</code></pre>\n- Tools and languages:<p><pre><code>    * Clojure &#x2F; ClojureScript (Om)\n    * PostgreSQL &#x2F; H2 &#x2F; SQLite\n    * Amazon Web Services (EC2, RDS)\n    * ZeroMQ\n</code></pre>\nWe really love Clojure and the ideas behind the language, we try to follow a event based (log like) approach in our infrastructure, avoiding the usual &quot;update in place&quot; pattern.<p>If this seems interesting we would like to hear from you, please send your CV to:<p>(str \\i \\p \\@ &quot;ride-on&quot; \\. \\e \\s)","time":1433177445,"type":"comment"}
