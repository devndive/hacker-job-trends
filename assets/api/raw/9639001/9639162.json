We work at a scale where seemingly small improvements can have a big impact. You&#x27;ll be working right in the heart of the profit center.<p>Our division of Connexity works in online display advertising through RTB, and run 50 to 100 million impressions each day. Our total transaction volume is between 5 and 10 billion per day, and we&#x27;ve served ads on nearly every site you&#x27;ve ever visited.<p>We&#x27;re primarily looking for someone to contribute to our Rails app. It&#x27;s used to administer hundreds of advertising campaigns across hundreds of publisher sites. It&#x27;s not just boring CRUD. It&#x27;s the heart of our display advertising business. The business folks will know you and have a tremendous amount of appreciation for your work.<p>This role is a great way to learn advertising tech at scale as well as other tools. In addition to the conventional Rails work, you&#x27;d get hands on experience with Redis, Hbase, PostgreSQL, and Scala. Several on the team started in the Rails app and have moved into other areas of interest (low-latency RTB bidder written in C or sophisticated reporting and optimization). It&#x27;s really possible to get bored around here unless you&#x27;re a boring person.<p>Our team is sharp and works well together. We enjoy perks such as paid lunch, a 9&#x2F;80 schedule (to get every other Friday off) and unlimited vacation; the culture of our team recognizes and respects the importance of your non-work life. Also, Ventura county is a pretty nice place to live&#x2F;work (unless you hate temperate coastal weather). If you&#x27;ve got Rails or other relevant web app experience, that&#x27;s a good start. More importantly, you&#x27;ll be eager to learn display advertising inside and out.  Attitude, ambition and sound judgement trump experience with a specific set of tools.<p>Unless you prefer to start with a HR-oriented chat, you can reach me (a lead engineer on the team) at david.larsen@connexity.com.","time":1433171467,"type":"comment"}
