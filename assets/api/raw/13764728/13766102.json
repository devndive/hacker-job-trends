While big data has become the central theme of the last decade in tech, it has left little mark on many aspects of healthcare. We&#x27;re changing that, and we need your help.<p>Our first product is Gocap: a connected device that integrates seamlessly into a user&#x27;s workflow to collect data on insulin doses. Dose information is combined with blood glucose readings collected by our app and sent to our backend. There it empowers healthcare providers to make treatment decisions based on thousands of data points rather than the single reading they use today. This requires well-built software at all levels of the stack: device firmware, mobile apps, backend data storage and processing, frontend web portals, and a variety of tools to support building and testing the physical devices our team designs. We all wear a lot of hats here, and we&#x27;re looking for software developers who&#x27;d like to do the same.<p>We expect you to:<p>•   Own the iOS app, refactoring and rebuilding the current codebase where necessary and adding features as we go.<p>•   Implement an iOS test suite that supports our verification needs.<p>•   Learn one or more of our other software platforms and contribute to those products (C, Android, Python, Node.js, Ruby on Rails).<p>•   Help determine the future of software at Common Sensing, from architectural and platform decisions to team process and structure.<p>In addition to software development, there will be opportunities to learn and participate in all aspects of the business, from fundraising to embedded electronics to clinical trials.<p>If this sounds fun, we&#x27;d like to hear from you at hiring@commmon-sensing.com.","time":1488390028,"type":"comment"}
