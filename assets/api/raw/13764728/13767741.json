Your main job is to build great software through your own efforts and the efforts of your team.<p>We are not looking for a rock star ninja unicorn sorceress code-crushing 100x developer-god. Real human beings only please.<p>This is an on-site position in American Fork, UT.<p>See more info and apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yoursco.workable.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;431152\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yoursco.workable.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;431152</a>.","time":1488398790,"type":"comment"}
