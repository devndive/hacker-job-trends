It&#x27;s a great app, but it could be even better if it had things like the following:<p>- Context-Sensitive Auto-Complete in the Query View (like in XCode)<p>- Advanced Import&#x2F;Export functions<p>- an Editor for Stored Procedures &#x2F; Functions<p>- Editable Query Results<p>- Working with Hierarchical Data (parent&#x2F;child relationships in a table)<p>- Editing Special Data Types like JSON<p>If you think you can tackle some of these features, email me: jakob@eggerapps.at<p>Looking for people with experience in Cocoa &#x2F; AppKit, Swift, Objective C, either on OS X or iOS.","time":1488553601,"type":"comment"}
