By using node-canvas to generate PDFs on the backend, we share the same Javascript code between client and server.<p>You&#x27;ll be working primarily with Javascript, using Node.js as well as PHP on the server, connecting to a MySQL database on Linux servers. Future plans could see React.js and RethinkDB becoming part of our stack. Ideally you have experience with Git, build scripts (we currently use Gulp), general server setup and operation (DevOps) as well as HTML&#x2F;CSS interface construction.<p>The job is onsite, in rural Cornwall (UK), right on the beautiful south-west coast :) Excellent surfing in the area!","time":1488386984,"type":"comment"}
