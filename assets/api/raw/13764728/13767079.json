Some of our customers include Airbnb, Slack, Netflix and Skyscanner.<p>We have a lot of interesting, creative work ahead and are looking for curious problem solvers to reimagine how our customers get their data into Geckoboard. You&#x27;ll be joining a friendly team with great people in an environment with empowered developers, flexible working conditions, and a focus on skill development.<p>We are heavy users of Go on the back-end, alongside some Ruby services. On the front-end, we&#x27;ve been using React (and, more recently, Redux) for 2+ years, but a lot of us have learned it on the job so you don&#x27;t need professional experience with it.<p>If you share our interest in distributed systems, databases, and data visualisation, we have plenty of fun problems for you to work on :)<p>Here are all our job listings:<p>* Back-end: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geckoboard.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;#op-155708-backend-developer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geckoboard.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;#op-155708-backend-develo...</a>\n* Front-end: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geckoboard.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;#op-26828-front-end-developer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geckoboard.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;#op-26828-front-end-devel...</a>\n* Product Designer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geckoboard.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;#op-155693-product-designer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geckoboard.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;#op-155693-product-design...</a>","time":1488395210,"type":"comment"}
