Our mission is to find a safe, loving, and stable family for every child.<p>Our software is used by private adoption agencies in 30 states. We&#x27;re in the midst of expanding into serving government foster care agencies and are close to reaching two-thirds of the foster care families in the state of California.<p>We have sustainable revenue, dedicated customers, and ample seed funding from top investors like First Round, Kapor, and Lowercase. We work together in SF and are growing rapidly.<p>Binti&#x27;s main SaaS web product is a conventional monolithic Rails&#x2F;Postgres app that works well for our use case, but remains fun to hack on. We&#x27;re building the monolith up higher, and looking forward to soon chipping off a service or two. Some of the areas in which we are especially seeking to round out our engineering team include devops, security, and compliance (we&#x27;re seeking a full-stack engineer interested in contributing in these areas early on - whether or not you are already an expert). We&#x27;re using Kubernetes&#x2F;Google Cloud.<p>We are also hiring an Enterprise Account Executive: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;binti&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;212262-enterprise-account-executive\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;binti&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;212262-enterprise-account-execut...</a><p>If you&#x27;re looking to join a small startup that has a large impact, apply online or email us at jobs@binti.com","time":1488393458,"type":"comment"}
