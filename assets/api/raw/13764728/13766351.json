We&#x27;re looking to grow our software team of currently six engineers (including myself) to support the rapid adoption of our technology. We&#x27;ve seen a growing number of high profile publications that use our technology (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;publications&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;publications&#x2F;</a>).<p>Recently, we released Loupe Cell Browser, a multi-platform native app that @jeffmellen and I have been working on which allows scientists to visualize and make discoveries in single cell gene expression data (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;single-cell&#x2F;software&#x2F;visualization&#x2F;latest&#x2F;what-is-loupe-cell-browser\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;single-cell&#x2F;software&#x2F;visuali...</a>). It was recently demoed at AGBT with our 1.3 million single cell neuron data set! Turns out visualizing 1 million points and allowing for interactions is a non-trivial task.<p>You can also read about (and run if you&#x27;d like) our massively parallel pipelines at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;</a>. We manage our pipelines with Go, develop analysis code using the NumPy stack, and drive our front-end applications with React&#x2F;Redux (previously Angular 1), but we&#x27;re always open to any technology that allows us to develop faster. No previous biological experience is required; we have plenty of computational biologists here to handle that, but there is a lot to learn about if you&#x27;re curious. You&#x27;ll work with a group of humble engineers that are alums of YC, MIT, Harvard, Caltech, Google, Facebook, and more.<p>We&#x27;re currently hiring for several software roles, but specifically for generalists, UI engineers, QA engineers, and infrastructure engineers. Our computational biology group is also always looking for bioinformaticians who are experienced with NGS, and our company is always looking for scientists and engineers (hardware included).
