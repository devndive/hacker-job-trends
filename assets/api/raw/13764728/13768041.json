I&#x27;m part of our engineering team, and we build systems for quants and traders. Our core challenge is building a platform that is simple and powerful enough that someone without a strong coding background can use thousands of cores to analyze terabytes of data. We build a lot of really cool stuff internally and we also use and contribute to open-source projects when it makes sense (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BlueMountainCapital\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BlueMountainCapital</a>).<p>I think that a big part of what has made working here so enjoyable is how much BlueMountain values strong technical people as well as openness and collaboration.<p>Email your resume and&#x2F;or github to: hn-at-bluemountaincapital-dot-com. After that, the process will be a simple 1 hour coding test, a technical phone call, and then an onsite interview. We mostly use Python and .NET. No experience in finance necessary.","time":1488400456,"type":"comment"}
