The Muse mobile app teaches users how to meditate while giving them real-time feedback on how they are doing. It helps to solve some fundamental difficulties with learning to meditate, such as: &quot;how do I do it?&quot;, &quot;how do I know if I am doing it right?&quot;, and &quot;how do I stay motivated?&quot;. Over the holidays, we unveiled our newest innovation, the Smith Lowdown Focus powered by Muse at CES 2017, a collaboration with Smith Optics. This latest innovation moves the Muse brain sensing technology into a stylish form factor that can fit into an athlete&#x27;s lifestyle. The app will feature tools that help athletes train their mind and build focus on or off the field. Our goal is to unlock human potential.<p>We use Google Cloud Services as much as possible with Python. We make use of Google Compute Engine, Task Queues, Pub&#x2F;Sub, Google File Storage, Datastore, and BigQuery.<p>Apply at: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.choosemuse.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.choosemuse.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a> or email hiring@choosemuse.com","time":1488385372,"type":"comment"}
