We&#x27;re small enough that you will have a big impact, but there&#x27;s still plenty of career opportunities within the rest of Schibsted.\nWe&#x27;re looking for a senior engineer that is very experienced with javascript and node.js (or so good at other stuff and willing to learn that it doesn&#x27;t matter). The rest of our stack consists of Postgresql and Elastic Search, virtual-dom for the web, and Heroku and Kubernetes&#x2F;AWS for hosting.\nHowever, we&#x27;re constantly experimenting and innovating and no strangers to trying new technology when we get a good opportunity (personally I can&#x27;t wait to use Elm in production; we just need more devs who knows it!).\nEmail me at andreas@omni.se if you&#x27;re interested.","time":1488384264,"type":"comment"}
