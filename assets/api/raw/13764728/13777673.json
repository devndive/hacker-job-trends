All of our founders are highly involved in the company and our wholly owned manufacturing chain is right down the street from our corporate office, so we have access to change things up as our consumer data tells us to.<p>Our tech team is small right now - our CEO is still an individual contributor + two devs + a data analyst so, for now, most of our positions are expert level requiring 5+ years of experience or more. We&#x27;re excited to be in final offer stages with a few folks we found on here last month and really excited to see some more HN candidates! (PS, Hi friends!)<p>Check out the jobs (on our site above) and email me with Hacker News in the subject and I will get back to you! Gabrielle (@) gravitybrands.com.<p>Cheers folks!","time":1488484955,"type":"comment"}
