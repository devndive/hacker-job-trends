We make a neat saas crm product used by boutique hotels all around the world to communicate with their guests. Fulltime remote is an option but we would prefer someone who wants to come live in Whistler and enjoy the outdoor lifestyle and be here to help mentor other junior devs. Our office is a short walk from the gondolas for skiing in the winter and mountain biking in the summer. Come work with an amazing team who never miss a pow day.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.jobscore.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;cendyn&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;web-application-developer-senior-level-full-stack-aOszf4-QSr5Q3idG1ZS6tF\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.jobscore.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;cendyn&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;web-applica...</a> and mention Hacker News in your application.","time":1488999286,"type":"comment"}
