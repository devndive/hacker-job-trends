We take pride in graduating students who are quick learners and matched to the current industry requirements.<p>Teachers lead by example, demonstrating their passion for learning and their commitment to programming as a craft.<p>Being a teacher at EDA is more like being a trekking guide rather than a follow-the-textbook style lecturer. Teachers lead discussions, guide inquiry, pair programme with students, emphasise key areas, support students in their projects and challenges, and provide feedback to students and each other.<p>What we need is:<p>* Minimum 3 years experience with web development<p>* Knowledge of JavaScript&#x2F;EcmaScript 6, Node.js&#x2F;npm, React and Redux<p>* Someone who understands teaching and what it means to support a student’s learning journey.<p>A more complete description and application is available here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trademe.co.nz&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;it&#x2F;programming-development&#x2F;listing-1258410892.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trademe.co.nz&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;it&#x2F;programming-development&#x2F;lis...</a> .","time":1488398162,"type":"comment"}
