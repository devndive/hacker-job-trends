I started working here this past October and I&#x27;m really enjoying it. GE Digital is intended to be a “startup” within the GE organization so we have some nice perks not usually found in a corporate environment like casual dress, free drinks, macbooks, and the ability to work from home. You will have the opportunity to touch lots of different tech, I was hired as a front end developer but now I’m doing backend and hybrid apps.<p>Providence is a great city. There&#x27;s a thriving arts, events and restaurants scene but the cost of living is much lower than Boston or NYC. I don’t drive and find I can get around easily with busses, walking, and my bike. Many of us that live in the city hang out together as well, in fact a group of us are going rock climbing after work today.<p>Here&#x27;s a list of roles we&#x27;re currently hiring for:<p><pre><code>    -Software Engineer- .NET\n    -Software Engineering Specialist  C#  .Net\n    -Software Engineering Specialist- Front-end\n\n    -Sr Software Engineer  C#  .Net\n    -Sr Software Engineer- Front-end\n    -Sr Software Engineer- Backend\n\n    -Software Engineer- Databases Oracle DBMS\n    -Sr Software Engineer- Databases  Oracle DBMS\n\n    -Sr Software Engineer – DevOps\n\n    -Sr Technical Project Manager\n\n    -Software Architect\n</code></pre>\nIf you&#x27;re interested please send a resume to me at robert.corey@ge.com along with what role&#x2F;s you are interested in.
