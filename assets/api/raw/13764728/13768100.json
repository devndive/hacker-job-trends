So why don’t corporate training programs typically take this into account? One-size-fits-all training modules are not an effective way to train employees.<p>To prove training success, learning leaders must measure and track employee results. Demonstrating learning effectiveness and measuring success is about more than quiz and test results, satisfaction surveys and the number of courses completed.<p>Using Zoomi, companies can maximize training efforts through increased completion rates, improved course effectiveness, reduced training costs, increased employee productivity and improved learner engagement.<p>Zoomi’s analytics will help your company demonstrate the correlation between training performance and business outcomes, making employee training an integral part of the business strategy, rather than a cost center factored into the annual budget.<p>Zoomi is hiring for several positions on our engineering and research teams.  Come join our team and change the way the world learns.","time":1488401113,"type":"comment"}
