Our founders, CEOs and their teams use our products every day to share and discuss their most pressing problems. Engineering at First Round provides a unique opportunity to get a look at how VC works from the inside, while shipping products around interesting startup-focused  problems. We code in Ruby on Rails—we even have an iOS app using Turbolinks&#x27;s iOS adapter. It&#x27;s a small team (just myself and one other engineer) so you&#x27;d have a huge impact on what we do.<p>If interested, feel free to email me directly kevin at first round dot com.","time":1488385245,"type":"comment"}
