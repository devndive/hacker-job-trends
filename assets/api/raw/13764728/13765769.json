Unlike other tools, which require you to manually instrument code, Heap captures all user actions automatically, and then lets you answer questions retroactively. Instead of writing a bunch of new tracking code every time you want to answer a question, the data is already in Heap waiting to be analyzed.<p>As an engineer at Heap, you will work on our in-house distributed system that ingests billions of events a week and processes queries over 100s of terabytes of data in seconds. To learn more about our distributed system, see our talks at PGConf [1] or our recent blog post on how we index our data [2].<p>We have a small eng team made up of 13 engineers, nine in San Francisco, and four scattered around the globe.<p>Our interview process consists of a one hour technical phone interview, a three hour takehome problem, and a full day onsite in which you&#x27;ll build a fake-but-plausible Heap feature.<p>We enjoy talking to everyone who interviews, so please apply: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;heapanalytics.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;heapanalytics.com&#x2F;jobs</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=iJLq3GV1Dyk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=iJLq3GV1Dyk</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.heapanalytics.com&#x2F;running-10-million-postgresql-indexes-in-production&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.heapanalytics.com&#x2F;running-10-million-postgresql...</a>","time":1488388682,"type":"comment"}
