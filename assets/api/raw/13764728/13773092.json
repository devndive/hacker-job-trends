After launching 4 years ago we&#x27;re already doing $1M+ in monthly sales with over 500,000 men using the service in the UK.<p>We&#x27;re looking for another talented, entrepreneurial software engineer to join us. Today we&#x27;re a team of 6 full stack engineers with lots of startup experience (the founders have started and sold 2 companies before), and we&#x27;re proud of the effort we&#x27;ve put into building and maintaining a strong engineering culture since the very first days of Thread. You&#x27;ll be one of the first technical hires, getting to build and own huge parts of the product, and help us continue to shape our culture.
