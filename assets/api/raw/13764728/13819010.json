NeuroCite works in biomedical research data publishing, aggregation, and sharing.  Knowledge and proficiency in database engineering, big data platforms, and cloud architecture is a must. We would like to find someone who understands the basics of HCUP, Marketscan, Epic, Cerner, and HIPAA and ideally has a general understanding of the medical research culture and process.  Experience in health informatics (in addition to being an engineer) definitely gets our attention but is not a requirement. We seek fresh ideas, inspired people, and new perspectives (particularly from outside of the medical community) to transform the way that the world does biomedical research. Please email CV and cover letter to info@neurocite.com.","time":1488963914,"type":"comment"}
