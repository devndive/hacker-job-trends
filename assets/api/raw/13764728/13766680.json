We teach the concepts behind the code, then help students build projects until everything clicks.  We get results -- we&#x27;ve had students get jobs at companies like SpaceX, and our NPS is around 60.<p>Our infrastructure is built around React and Python 3, and we deploy using Docker and Kubernetes.  We interactively run and check student code, a major technical challenge.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone to own our technical stack and direction, while also leading and growing our engineering team.  Ideally you&#x27;ve built something at scale, and can balance adding customer value (shipping fast) with clean code and architecture.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone who&#x27;s passionate about teaching, which both involves sharing our mission (to give people access to high quality education at a low cost), and wanting to mentor other engineers.<p>You&#x27;ll have a lot of latitude over technical decisions, and you&#x27;ll have significant input on product decisions as well.  We&#x27;re bootstrapped and profitable, so this is also a chance to learn more about the business side.<p>This is a great role if you want a make huge impact on the world, grow a business, and rapidly expand your skillset.<p>If this is interesting, please email vik at dataquest.io.","time":1488392988,"type":"comment"}
