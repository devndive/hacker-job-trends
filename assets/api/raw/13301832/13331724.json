We believe we’re on to something big, but to get there we’re working through end-to-end complex problems in a complex and old-fashioned domain. We’re taking an unconventional approach (event sourcing with a twist and a touch of farmville) and dealing with big data to boot.<p>DESIGNER POSITION\nLogistics software is notorious for overloading users with information, which requires a masters in spaghetti science to understand. Complexity in enterprise software is unavoidable, but we believe the end user shouldn’t have to jump through hoops to manage it. This may seem simple, but logistics is filled with antiquated processes and users.<p>BACK-END POSITION\nThis isn’t a run of the mill MVC app and requires solving performance and scalability problems in distributed systems using combined data from many sources.\nBack-end stack: GCP, Kafka, Scala, Kubernetes, Jenkins, NGINX, Docker with a bit of postgres, some simple mongo for non-critical functions.","time":1483652825,"type":"comment"}
