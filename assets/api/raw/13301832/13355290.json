We use first party mobile data to build our models. We are a small, ambitious and creative team with a great working environment. We are looking for likeminded data engineers to help us scale our platform and build the pipelines and tools enabling us to gain maximum insight into our data. There will be a lot of opportunities for learning new technologies and skills. We mostly use Python.<p>Interviews will consist of an informal discussion with the senior team, technical test and trial days.<p>Please apply with CV, relevant links to github, SO, etc. to isambard@huq.io","time":1483956981,"type":"comment"}
