A company that has both an office with a whiteboard and a 55,000 square foot factory near downtown Los Angeles?<p>We are revolutionizing a 400 year old industry and have built a little product that, in less than a year, has more customers queued up than we can handle.<p>At its core our app lets licensed interior designers upload a photo of a piece of furniture, and have it manufactured and shipped to their clients. But that&#x27;s really the tip of the iceberg. Our many products in development range from traditional web and mobile apps to an RFID system which tracks furniture movement within a warehouse.<p>Our CEO previously co-founded one of the most successful tech startups in Los Angeles, which also happens to be in the interior design space. We believe in customer focus, hard work, engineering discipline, moving fast, and checking egos at the door.<p>If that sounds like you shoot &quot;andy&quot; an email @byshowroom.com to learn more!","time":1483388802,"type":"comment"}
