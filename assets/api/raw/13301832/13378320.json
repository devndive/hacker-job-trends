NIMBLE is a framework built in R for writing general statistical models and algorithms. NIMBLE includes a domain-specific language embedded in R for programming statistical algorithms. The language is compiled by automatically generating and compiling C++ code and interfacing C++ objects to R. This position includes work to harness parallel processing and automatic differentiation, to generate interfaces with other languages such as Python, to improve NIMBLE&#x27;s scope and efficiency for large statistical models, and to build other new features into NIMBLE.<p>Please see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;r-nimble.org&#x2F;nimble-is-hiring-a-programmer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;r-nimble.org&#x2F;nimble-is-hiring-a-programmer</a> for details and the link to the application.","time":1484176148,"type":"comment"}
