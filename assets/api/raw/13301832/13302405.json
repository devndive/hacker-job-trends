Our mission is to find a safe, loving, and stable family for every child.<p>Binti&#x27;s software is used by private adoption agencies in 30 states. We&#x27;re in the midst of expanding into serving government foster care agencies and are close to reaching two-thirds of the foster care families in the state of California.<p>We have sustainable revenue, fanatical customers, and ample seed funding from top investors like First Round, Kapor, and Lowercase. We work together in SF and are growing rapidly.<p>Binti&#x27;s main SaaS web product is a conventional monolithic Rails&#x2F;Postgres app that delivers value in heaps and heaps, and remains super fun to hack on. We&#x27;re building the monolith up higher and higher, and looking forward to soon chipping off a service or two (perhaps in Elixir?). Some of the areas in which we are especially seeking to round out our engineering team include web accessibility, front-end development, operations&#x2F;&quot;devops&quot;, UX, and security. We do not expect you to have all these skills, but are listing them here to give you a sense of our most pressing needs. We&#x27;re using Kubernetes&#x2F;Google Cloud.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;binti.com&#x2F;binti-careers&#x2F;software-engineer&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;binti.com&#x2F;binti-careers&#x2F;software-engineer&#x2F;</a>","time":1483376674,"type":"comment"}
