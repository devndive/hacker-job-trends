Our customers are tier-1 financial institutions and large multinationals.<p>At the moment we&#x27;re looking for generalist engineers of any experience level. We work in Python, Go, Java and JavaScript.

We&#x27;re always looking to open source more.<p>Our small, tight-knit team has a can-do mentality and isn&#x27;t scared to use new tools when they are the right ones. We have a relentless focus on quality of delivery.<p>Drop me a line (email in profile) if any questions.<p>Email jobs@arachnys.com to apply, linking to your GitHub or some other code that you think tells a good story about you.","time":1483394832,"type":"comment"}
