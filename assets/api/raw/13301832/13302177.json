Any type of software engineer will do, but this position is going to involve writing and building automated tests for our existing software and system development teams. This individual will officially be an engineering member of the QA department and will be lightly disassociated from the actual engineering team.<p>This individual must have experience with writing automated tests (functional, regression, etc) and experience with any of the AWS stack is a plus.<p>Unfortunately, we absolutely must have someone with either an active permanent or interim SECRET clearance.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, email (me at ericharrison dot info) with your resume and I&#x27;ll pass it along to my QA lead. Thanks. :D","time":1483375230,"type":"comment"}
