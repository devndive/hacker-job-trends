We&#x27;re launching some new products in the coming months that I&#x27;m really excited about. I love working here as an engineer. It&#x27;s a great balance of challenge, freedom, and impact.<p>We&#x27;ve been growing quickly and we&#x27;re looking to hire a DevOps engineer! For some background, we had a manually configured AWS infrastructure that we&#x27;ve just retired in favor of an Ansible &#x2F; Terraform-based setup. We&#x27;ve automated infrastructure and deploys so it&#x27;s a great time to come in and shape where we go from here. For example:<p>* Dockerize everything?<p>* Build out a Kubernetes cluster for our services?<p>* Use Spinnaker for a Continuous Delivery pipeline?<p>To be determined!<p>If you&#x27;re interested or have questions what it&#x27;s like to work here, please contact me at kevinlondon@chownow.com or our recruiter, Candice, at candice@chownow.com. This position is not yet formally posted but we are taking applications for it.<p>We also have positions open for Front-End (Ember.js &#x2F; Node), Back-End (Python) engineers, and a Data Analyst on our careers page at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;chownow?lever-via=MO5-ac-qvc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;chownow?lever-via=MO5-ac-qvc</a>.","time":1483385536,"type":"comment"}
