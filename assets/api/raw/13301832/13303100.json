Today, 50% of parents aren’t saving for college at all, and less than 3% of U.S. families that could benefit from a 529 College Savings Plan are actually enrolled in one. With CollegeBacker, a parent can open a 529 in minutes with just $25, determine a smart savings goal specific to their child, and enlist family and friends as &quot;Backers.&quot;<p>If interested, shoot me an email: abby at collegebacker<p>More details: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;collegebacker&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;175887-lead-software-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;collegebacker&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;175887-lead-software-eng...</a>","time":1483381115,"type":"comment"}
