We have a plan to get there and funding to make it happen.<p>We believe strongly in customer development and in staying very lean. We are using Erlang, CouchDB, and JavaScript on the back end and lots of things on the front end, since we will need web, desktop, and mobile clients.<p>We are currently looking for two engineers, one for the front end and one for the back end. I'm looking for intelligent, motivated people and am not interested in buzzword bingo on a resume.<p>These are employees three and four in the company and include equity! If you are especially passionate about helping people secure their online lives, I am fully accepting of remote workers.
