The server uses HAProxy to distribute the incoming requests among mongrels. Static files are served using apache. Facebook has a new requirement that by September 1, 2011 all apps have to move to the new OAUTH 2.0 authentication system using the Graph API and work with SSL connections.<p>For more details on the requirements and to reach me, please go here:\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/mi57W0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bit.ly/mi57W0</a>","time":1309565601,"type":"comment"}
