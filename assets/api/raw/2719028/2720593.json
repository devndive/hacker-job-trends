Our dev team is all remote right now, but it'd be great if you were local to the peninsula or willing to relocate at some point in the coming months.<p>We've built a real-time stack of our own that bridges backbone.js &#60;-&#62; socket.io &#60;-&#62; gunicorn+gevent (through nginx) &#60;-&#62; django. As the stack matures, we may release the source. The web application is nearly all single-page architecture. We use coffeescript pretty much everywhere, including our javascript tests.<p>* backend: postgres, redis, python, django, gevent + gunicorn<p>* frontend: coffeescript, jQuery, backbone.js, socket.io, compass<p>I'm looking for:<p>1. Advanced web jacks-of-many-trades. You know a lot about several things from above and have at least tried your hand at a demo app using the rest. Backend/frontend/deployment. We'll be growing our user base very soon and will need some deployment automation skills (chef or puppet + fabric) and knowledge/experience scaling the above technologies. Note: we have a great lead architect right now, but are on the lookout for locals (or those who can move to the bay) who want senior developer ownership and can be mentors/leaders as we move towards having more of a local presence.<p>2. Talented web app designers (referrals would also be good). Even with the nifty tech we're building, our app will probably live/die based on making an intuitive UI with fun and easy experience. There are several unique challenges in this product that require novel widgets -- creativity is a must. Would be great if you have more than just design skills, but very high quality design is more important than ability to build it.<p>gmail - davidmarble","time":1309563688,"type":"comment"}
