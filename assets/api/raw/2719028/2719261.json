Our development team is small and we're still giving very large stock options to anyone who joins (&#62;1%.)<p>We're looking for a generalist - everyone on our team touches front-end, backend and database. You'll be working with javascript and all the usual suspects on the client site (including socket.io) and you'll be working in Python on Django on the server. We're not necessarily looking for someone who knows the specific tech that we use, but mainly someone who's really smart and able to learn quickly.<p>Apply here:\n<a href=\"http://jobs.startupnorth.ca/job/insanely-smart-web-developer-waterloo-on-canada-top-hat-monocle-355bb2c903/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jobs.startupnorth.ca/job/insanely-smart-web-developer...</a>","time":1309541482,"type":"comment"}
