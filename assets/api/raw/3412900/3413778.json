We've recently hired a sales team and we've got plenty of work to do.<p>Our apps are Rails-based, but are anything but typical. We do some computationally heavy stuff and basically use Rails apps as a presentation layer. We're usually dealing with huge datasets and need someone that has a strong sense of what Rails is doing \"underneath.\" ActiveRecord behaves differently when you're dealing with 60,000+ records at a time.<p>We need a C programmer to back up our chief scientist. Operations research experience is a huge plus.<p>We use several AWS tools including EC2, S3, SNS, and RDS (We also use Heroku for several apps). We need someone to manage our EC2 environment. This probably wouldn't amount to a full-time responsibility, but we do need someone to \"own\" this aspect of our business. We'd like to have a C programmer + UNIX admin combo but if you can fill our Rails and sysadmin needs, that works too.<p>If you're interested, take a whack at our developer test and send us an email.<p>- <a href=\"http://emcien.com/dev-test.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://emcien.com/dev-test.html</a><p>- emcienjobs@emcien.com","time":1325449942,"type":"comment"}
