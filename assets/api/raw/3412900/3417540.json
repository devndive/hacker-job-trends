I blame the hangover I had yesterday :)<p>Social Tables (<a href=\"http://www.socialtables.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.socialtables.com</a>), a funded, DC-based startup is looking for a Senior Developer/VP of Engineering (employee #1, wahoo!).<p>If you immediately thought that this startup makes databases social, you're the kind of person we're looking for and you'll fit right in. Please read on :)<p>Social Tables is the seating plan platform for events. You know how weddings, galas and other large events have assigned seating? Well, the biggest PITA in planning these events is figuring out how to seat guests (it can take weeks). Our cloud-based software solves that problem.<p>Since launching in May 2011, we've seated 43k guests at 450 different events. We're expanding rapidly through big strategic partnerships and aggressive customer acquisition.<p>In this role, your responsibilities will be to lead product development of our next version. We prefer Rails but if PHP is your weapon of choice, that's cool. You should also be proficient in JavaScript since things will be a little heavier on the client-side going forward.<p>You must be a motivated self-starter who is energized by teamwork and loves to learn new things.<p>Traction aside, right now is the perfect time to join Social Tables and we would love to tell you why. In addition to competitive compensation, you will get serious equity (we agree with Naval in his recent post on this issue - <a href=\"http://startupboy.com/2011/12/13/why-you-cant-hire/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://startupboy.com/2011/12/13/why-you-cant-hire/</a>).<p>If this sounds interesting to you, email me: dan [at] socialtables dot [com!]<p>Thanks for reading and applying!","time":1325541147,"type":"comment"}
