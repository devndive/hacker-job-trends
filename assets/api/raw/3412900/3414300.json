Android experience also welcome.<p>We're a small but profitable business that licenses software for making tour guides and visitor directories.  The company was founded on sales of a specialized hardware device - still in use in many places, such as the Spy Museum in Washington, D.C. - but the company has now moved to producing white-label mobile apps for iOS and Android.<p>I'm currently running both the iPhone project and the Rails back-end myself, but it's too much to juggle with the growing business.  Looking for someone to help out on either project, so I can focus on the other.<p>Contact evan.james@barzadventures.com.","time":1325464650,"type":"comment"}
