We help the mobile app ecosystem thrive by enabling developers to make money from their apps, consumers to enjoy free experiences, and advertisers to reach relevant consumers in a privacy friendly way.<p>We are tackling hard and interesting technical challenges, creating massive opportunity, and having a ton of fun in the process. We’re always looking for ambitious, driven self-starters who want to be on the leading edge of developing technology.<p>We are looking for a top tier software engineer or chronically under-recognized hacker. Along the top of your resume, you could list 30-odd acronyms from SQL to XML and back through the JVM a dozen times, but hate the idea that that’s what companies will evaluate you on. You don’t code, you craft. Your solutions are as elegant as they are simple. You love getting that perfect solution that takes only 4 lines of code instead of an ungodly 6. You have experience building real products in the real world.<p>Final note: The Software Development Engineer position is for one of the first few engineers. You’ll be in a position to shape the direction of the code, the team, the product, and the company. We’re looking for people who are excited by that.","time":1325444665,"type":"comment"}
