I'm a developer there and relocated over there about a year ago and have been very happy with it. We have people from all over the world relocating to work with us and are very well set up to handle relocation / visa issues.<p>It's a rapidly growing company that represents the biggest chunk of the Priceline group of companies where problems that look relatively mundane on paper become much more interesting due to the scale and growth levels we're operating at.<p>We use Perl for almost everything with a MySQL backend and Git for development. We get our changes out really fast, it's rare for your code not to be on our live systems within hours of you pushing it.<p>We have a relatively flat hierarchy with minimum levels of bureaucracy since we're very data driven and have a clear goal: helping our customers. Everything we do is aimed at solving problems for our customers, if it doesn't help our customers we're not interested in doing it.<p>You don't have to know Perl in advance to be a developer there. We've hired people who've done C, Java etc. before.<p>I'd be happy to answer any questions at avarab@gmail.com and/or forward your resume. <a href=\"http://booking.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://booking.com/jobs</a> also has some good information.","time":1325453789,"type":"comment"}
