In our short history, we have launched in 3 cities (London, Bristol and Manchester) with hundreds of partner restaurants, and 35,000 app downloads.<p>The next step is going national, and building tech that allows predictive dynamic pricing -- for example, tell restaurants &#x27;based on your location, cuisine type, users nearby and the weather, a 30% discount will attract 5 new customers in the next 2 hours.&#x27;<p>We are hiring a mid-to-senior full-stack developer, ideally with experience in Javascript (mainly Angular&#x2F;Ionic) or Java (Spring Boot). You would be developer number 2 in a small startup, so there are lots of opportunities to make a meaningful difference to the future of the CityMunch tech.<p>We are currently based in Google Campus in Shoreditch, with plans to move elsewhere in Shoreditch in early 2018. Having raised a seed round already, and with additional investment from Just Eat, we are set to continue our fast growth in 2018.<p>To apply, email me at amy@citymunchapp.com","time":1514926053,"type":"comment"}
