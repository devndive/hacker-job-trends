Customers love us because we support a very wide range of devices with a variety of testing frameworks and we do it well.<p>That said, we have some challenges. Here&#x27;s some:<p>* Adding support for new iOS and Android versions as soon as possible after launch<p>* Digging into low-level OS code to do things like remote control them, and doing this reliably across all devices<p>* Handling seamless deployments despite having state in the form of physical devices that we can&#x27;t just abstract away<p>* Scaling to meet the demands of some very big customers<p>If you&#x27;ve got more questions about work here please let me know! I&#x27;ve worked for Sauce Labs on the real device team here in Berlin for over two years now and love it. Our stack is mostly Java&#x2F;Docker&#x2F;Angular with a bit of Python, haproxy, and soon React - you&#x27;ll get your hands dirty in all sorts of tech all through the pipeline.<p>Here&#x27;s the link to the Java backend position, roughly the same as my own position here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;f8enm41\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;f8enm41</a><p>If you&#x27;re in SF, Vancouver, Poland (or even remote for the right person) we have a bunch more openings for web developers, customer success, product managers, and more: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;ex5dth1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;ex5dth1</a>","time":1514910526,"type":"comment"}
