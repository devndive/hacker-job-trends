We’re looking for a couple new prototyping-and-invention oriented colleagues to join us, and we naturally thought of you all. Our approach is multidisciplinary, but we’re seeking depth in interaction design (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;khanacademy&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;825531\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;khanacademy&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;825531</a>) and scrappy prototype engineering (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;khanacademy&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;825502\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;khanacademy&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;825502</a>).<p>For an idea of our work: we’re currently exploring how we might support students in developing rich understanding through open-ended, free-response-style activities (rather than the typical fill-in-the-blank or multiple-choice). We hope to help millions build critical thinking, historical reasoning, and literary analysis skills.<p>Here are a few reports on more conceptual exploratory projects from some of the folks involved: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.khanacademy.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;reports&#x2F;cantor\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.khanacademy.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;reports&#x2F;cantor</a> and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.khanacademy.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;reports&#x2F;early-math\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.khanacademy.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;reports&#x2F;early-math</a><p>Please let us know if you’re at all interested in chatting more about the roles (andy@khanacademy.org).
