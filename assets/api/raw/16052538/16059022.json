We take pride in the fact that we’re working on one of the most pressing problems in our society: ensuring that our seniors are taken care of despite seemingly endless challenges caused by fiscal and labor shortages.<p>We’re a geographically distributed company, with 4 team members working out of our office in San Francisco and about 40 others working from all over the US, Canada, Mexico and a number of other countries. We have built all products and processes to equally accommodate on-site and remote team members, and we highly value this ability to attract the best talent from across the world.<p>We’re looking for a VP of Operations to ensure flawless execution of all of our teams. You will be reporting to our CEO, and your success will be measured in the quality of our service and our ability to scale our processes. Your scope of work will cover the conceptual design of our process maps, budget planning, as well as management of our client- and caregiver-facing operational departments.<p>More info: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kindlycare.com&#x2F;vp-operations&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kindlycare.com&#x2F;vp-operations&#x2F;</a><p>Let&#x27;s chat!
