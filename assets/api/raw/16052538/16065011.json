Anonymous reviews on zocdoc, yelp and google suck. That&#x27;s why 70% of people ask their friends for doctor recommendations. We&#x27;re making it so when you&#x27;re looking for a doctor it&#x27;s easily to discover the doctors your friends recommend.<p>we launched in October and people are people love us. It&#x27;s not obvious that healthcare is social, but it is. The last time you went to a doctor, how&#x27;d you find them? It probably wasn&#x27;t easy and you probably asked friends. This is one of those obvious ideas that we couldn&#x27;t believe didn&#x27;t exist in the world.<p>We&#x27;re growing and looking for someone to help us out at engineer #2. You&#x27;ll have a huge impact on the codebase and product and work directly with the founders to bring our mission of making healthcare easier to life.
