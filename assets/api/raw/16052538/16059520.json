All code we make is free, we sell our time to build custom implementations from collecting and analyzing sensor data from offshore windparks to managing product flow in car assembly lines. We participate in European research projects contributing to open source solutions and have time to tinker (try building an open source sdr telco solution, create embedded systems to play soccer with drones, etc). We all use Chromebooks, have a flat hierarchy, paperless offices and no meetings. We mostly hack in Python and (vanilla) JavaScript. Come join us!","time":1514969804,"type":"comment"}
