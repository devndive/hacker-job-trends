We are seeking two kinds of engineers:<p>1) Someone who can write a high-throughput, low-latency proxy from scratch (think Nginx, HAProxy, Jetty, Finagle, DropWizard etc.). This is specifically not someone who is skilled in the design of web services, but someone who has skills in lower-level languages for use in systems at scale.<p>2) Someone who can implement the stellar consensus protocol from scratch. This is someone who may have worked on core development for a project like Stellar, Bitcoin, or Ethereum.<p>To apply, email Joshua G, Founder, HNJobs@mobilecoin.com.","time":1514957565,"type":"comment"}
