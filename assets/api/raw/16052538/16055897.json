In a nutshell: replacing Excel and Dropbox with purpose-built software. If you&#x27;re a retailer we are vendor-management system to you, if you&#x27;re a manufacturer we&#x27;re a customer-management and content-management system. There is a surprising lot of things that modern technology can add to the supply chain management world. Exciting stuff.<p>In the principal role you will take over a few outcomes (feature + feature adoption + feedback + iteration) and drive them to completion. Things are going well if I can stop worrying about a task that you have taken upon yourself.<p>In the junior role you&#x27;re expected to take direction and learn about the business and the system as you go about adding features, starting from smaller ones and progressing towards more complicated ones.<p>You don&#x27;t have to know the stack when you come it, but then you will have to pick it up as you go. ASP.NET MVC &#x2F; MSSQL &#x2F; AWS &#x2F; iOS &#x2F; html+css+js+Vue.js<p>In the interview I care more about ability to pick up skills, rather than any particular skill. The second thing I care about is ability to keep many moving parts in one&#x27;s head for the duration of a conversation. It might be rather hard for you to self-assess though.<p>Benefits, competitive salary, good working hours, time off.
