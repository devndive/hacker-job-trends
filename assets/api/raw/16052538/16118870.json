We specialize in a holistic approach inspired by HCD and Lean. Services include CTO consulting, product strategy, engagement strategy, UX&#x2F;UI, and development plus long term BML iterations and maintenance. We work with large and small companies&#x2F;startups on projects ranging from 1-6 months with 2-6 people on each project.<p>We build full stack web, mobile, physical installations, etc. Our favorite stack is React&#x2F;Redux, GraphQL, Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix (although frequently Rails, Node, etc), and React Native.  We also use a wide range of other tech as needed since we face a pretty diverse set of challenges.  Recent and upcoming examples: .Net, C++&#x2F;Qt, embedded Linux, Native iOS&#x2F;Swift, Native Android&#x2F;Kotlin.<p>Working at Blackbird is very different from larger product companies. We operate in very strategic relationships with our clients which gives us a unique opportunity every few months to deep dive into a new interesting understanding of our client&#x27;s business and build ground up new apps where everyone is making major and early contributions.<p>I am a founder so ask me anything! We&#x27;re looking in particular for: lead level in San Francisco, mid&#x2F;sr level devs anywhere, C++, iOS, and full stack but if there are other aspects of what we do that interest you definitely still hit me up!<p>Email me at contact@blackbird-studios.io","time":1515616936,"type":"comment"}
