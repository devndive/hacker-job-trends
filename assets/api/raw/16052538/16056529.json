We&#x27;d like someone with strong AWS chops and experience with provisioning&#x2F;config management tools (we currently use Ansible and Terraform). Some other nice points to have would be experience with managing monitoring or metric aggregation systems and PCI compliance.<p>One notable feature to me is the transparency in the organization. The whys and hows of both the past and future are well communicated across most teams. The things we work on are clearly tied to goals, and at the end of the day, numbers. Our work doesn&#x27;t exist in a vacuum and feels grounded in a service that actually helps people.<p>See a more detailed description and apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.jobvite.com&#x2F;j?cj=o9qy6fwX&amp;s=hn\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.jobvite.com&#x2F;j?cj=o9qy6fwX&amp;s=hn</a> or drop me a line at nat@livewatch.com","time":1514932763,"type":"comment"}
