I&#x27;m one of the engineers at Sense.  Climate change is _the_ issue of our generation, and I have always wanted to be a part of the solution.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here at Sense.  We&#x27;re shipping a product which lets homeowners take control of their energy usage.  For the first time, homeowners can get a device-by-device breakdown of their entire house&#x27;s energy footprint, and live feedback of what&#x27;s going on.<p>Residential energy use is roughly a third of the global warming problem.  Yet it&#x27;s nearly impossible for most people to measure!  And you can&#x27;t change what you can&#x27;t measure.  So, that&#x27;s why we exist.  We&#x27;ve been shipping for more than a year, and have huge aspirations for 2018!<p>The #problems &gt;&gt; #people, so you will get lots of exciting, meaningful work.<p>Open positions:<p>Data Scientist &#x2F; Machine Learning Engineer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;E3548DBBE1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;E3548DBBE1</a><p>Web Designer &#x2F; Developer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;63B9855CE2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;63B9855CE2</a><p>Please get in touch with me directly if you like!  jonah@sense.com","time":1514946735,"type":"comment"}
