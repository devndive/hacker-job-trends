We are working to modernize how bacterial infections are diagnosed - while current approaches take 2-5 days, we are developing a technology that diagnoses infections in hours: we sequence the genomes of the bacteria in a clinical infection and use machine learning methods to predict the antibiotic resistance pattern.<p>We are seeking to hire a highly motivated software developer to join our small but growing computational team - you will be the first non-founder computational hire and play a large role in our technology development. You will be implementing cloud-deployable machine learning methods, developing infrastructure and compute pipelines for large genomic datasets, along with executing a broad range of interdisciplinary tasks that come along with working in a small startup. Our tech is in python and C, and we use a standard set of bionformatics tools. Machine learning experience helpful.<p>Application and more info about DZD can be found here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dayzerodiagnostics.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;software-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dayzerodiagnostics.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;software-engineer</a>","time":1515627061,"type":"comment"}
