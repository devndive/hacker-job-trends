An ops visibility tool is only as good as the data it collects, and we pride ourselves on gathering everything from logs to system metrics to application metrics to API data. If you enjoy constantly getting to play with new tools, come help us connect to... everything. You&#x27;ll get to play with packages from Apache to Zookeeper, APIs from AWS to, er, Azure, while tackling challenges such as monitoring 100,000+ simultaneous log files using minimal CPU.<p>At Scalyr, we&#x27;ve built a log analysis and ops visibility tool that our users rave about, because it smashes expectations for performance and ease of use. We offer the equity, influence, and fun of an early-stage company, with stability, great pay, and a low-stress culture. We have great backers, strong traction, and an 11-digit target market. I&#x27;ve built half a dozen startups, including Writely (aka Google Docs), and I can honestly say this is my favorite so far.<p>If this sounds like fun, check out the link below, or drop us a line at jobs@scalyr.com.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scalyr.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;agent-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scalyr.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;agent-engineer</a>","time":1478022321,"type":"comment"}
