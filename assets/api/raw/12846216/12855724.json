The first step in that direction is to take the thousands of hours weâ€™ve spent building infrastructure and to condense all that experience and code into pre-assembled Infrastructure Packages. Each Infrastructure Package is a best-practices definition of a single piece of infrastructure (e.g. a Docker cluster or a relational database) that is reusable, battle-tested, documented, configurable, and supported (read more here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.gruntwork.io&#x2F;gruntwork-infrastructure-packages-7434dc77d0b1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.gruntwork.io&#x2F;gruntwork-infrastructure-packages-...</a>).<p>In other words, we&#x27;re like a DevOps team that has already built everything you need. We give customers 100% of the source code for our packages and we offer a subscription that includes support, package updates, access to the Gruntwork community, security alerts, proactive maintenance, and more.<p>We are looking for Full Stack Engineers, DevOps Engineers, and AWS experts. We make heavy use of Terraform, Docker, Packer, AWS, and Go. Currently, we have one project where we&#x27;re looking for experts in the Windows environment (e.g. IIS, SQL Server, Active Directory) and one where we are looking for an expert on Kubernetes. We are a completely distributed company, so location doesn&#x27;t matter, and the work is 100% remote.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, email us at careers@gruntwork.io.","time":1478100379,"type":"comment"}
