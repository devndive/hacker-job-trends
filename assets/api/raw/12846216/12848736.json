We have a lot of Clojure and some Scala here, any FP experience is good though. There&#x27;s also a lot of Python, Ruby, and R laying around, but mostly just legacy stuff. We handle a lot of data, experience handling a lot of data or distributed systems is a big plus. We&#x27;re processing satellite imagery for many states every day, all in AWS.<p>Fair warning, our parent company is Monsanto, and some people might have an issue with that. On the upside, you&#x27;ll get to work with for-real scientists on a daily basis and Monsanto has excellent benefits. And we have lots of for-real paying customers.<p>Please email me at chris.gore@climate.com if you are interested, thanks.","time":1478024539,"type":"comment"}
