I went to see a customer yesterday (bulge-bracket bank), and they told me that what they loved about Arachnys is that we deliver better than any enterprise software vendor they have ever worked with. If you want to be part of that sort of team, get in touch. jobs@arachnys.com<p>We sell software to manage risk and compliance processes in big financial institutions. Lots of data, complex workflows, different natural and computer languages, you name it.<p>At the moment we&#x27;re looking for a generalist role and two specialist roles:<p>1. GENERALIST: Pull-up-your-sleeves mentality, expertise with web development (Python&#x2F;Go&#x2F;JS are our main languages). Like seeing things through to completion.<p>2. DEVOPS: We&#x27;re increasingly getting asked to manage complex data privacy problems as well as being probed on security. If you know what an HSM is, or have managed sensitive data in a devops context, we&#x27;d love to talk to you.<p>3. GRAPH DATA: Most risk problems boil down to relationships that can be teased out of data. We&#x27;re looking for someone who has worked on complex graph data issues. Experience at scale is a big advantage. If you have strong opinions about Spark, Neo4j and&#x2F;or Palantir, get in touch.<p>Drop me a line (email in profile) if any questions.","time":1478023049,"type":"comment"}
