Your daily business will be digesting current deep learning and reinforcement learning research, maturing and extending our Python&#x2F;Theano code base, and driving development of micropsi industries&#x27; core technology towards applications in process industries and robotics.<p>Ideally, you have a strong background in machine learning and share our vision of bringing together connectionist and symbolic AI. Our long-term goal is to bridge the gap between low-level deep neural learning and semantic representation, reasoning, and planning with a truly integrated architecture.<p>Contact: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.micropsi-industries.com&#x2F;join_us&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.micropsi-industries.com&#x2F;join_us&#x2F;</a>","time":1478083977,"type":"comment"}
