We break stuff, in a good way, because we&#x27;re here to get things done and help humanity push forward. Join us, let&#x27;s have some fun.<p>Kitty Hawk’s R&amp;D team is currently flight-testing a variety of aircraft with autopilots written in Haskell and code-generated to C. Our simulation environment, ground station, and optimization code are written in Haskell, and all components are either currently open source or will be released once they stabilize.<p>We are looking for a software-engineering focused person with experience or interest in simulation of dynamic systems, control systems, robotics, aerospace, or estimation.
