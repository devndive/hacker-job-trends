We make our own desktop CNC machines and write software for the whole stack, from machine firmware all the way through to the browser-based design app, Easel. Our main focus right now is (1) making new ways of designing in 3D and (2) making the feedback loop between design, simulation and carving faster. That means lots of unique technical and UI&#x2F;UX challenges.<p>If you are interested in design interfaces, how&#x2F;why people learn to make, computational geometry, or if getting involved in educating the next generation of makers, we are looking to talk to you.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;inventables&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;97588#.WBeb7uErKV4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;inventables&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;97588#.WBeb7uE...</a>","time":1478013357,"type":"comment"}
