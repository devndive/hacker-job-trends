I’m posting because we are bootstrapped and profitable, and we’re hiring software engineers (with 1+ year of industry experience). To give you an idea of what you’d do, one engineer on our team wrote an API that helps print over 10,000 shirts a day. Our stack is node, react, angular, and mongo.<p>We may have already answered your questions about us on <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;scalable.press&#x2F;software-engineer&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;scalable.press&#x2F;software-engineer&#x2F;</a>. It covers hiring process, engineering culture, past projects, and future projects you might work on with us.<p>Interested? Email me and mention you’re from HN. No need to send a resume—I’d like to hear about what you’ve been working on lately, and feel free to include any relevant project links.<p>ericzhang@scalablepress.com<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;scalable.press&#x2F;software-engineer&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;scalable.press&#x2F;software-engineer&#x2F;</a><p>PS We&#x27;re also hiring a UI designer and a graphic designer. If either sounds like you, definitely reach out.<p>We&#x27;ve had a lot of success growing our team from HN&#x27;s hiring thread and hope to continue!","time":1478017597,"type":"comment"}
