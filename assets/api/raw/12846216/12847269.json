Right now, the world is changing so fast that nobody knows what&#x27;s going on (or what&#x27;s already happened and what one&#x27;s organization already knows).<p>Our office is located in Tribeca and we&#x27;re looking for anybody (2+ years experience) interested in working on an early stage angel-funded platform that&#x27;s live with customers and using the latest technology.  You would be joining a team of 4 onsite (plus 2 remote).  Our stack is ReactJS&#x2F;Python3&#x2F;Django built on top of AWS&#x2F;Ansible.  I&#x27;m a serial startup CTO and you&#x27;ll definitely learn a ton from being here.  There are real leadership growth opportunities for more senior people as well.<p>We&#x27;re open to remote work but only for exceptional candidates who already have extensive experience working remotely.<p>Email me: adam (at) factr.com","time":1478017301,"type":"comment"}
