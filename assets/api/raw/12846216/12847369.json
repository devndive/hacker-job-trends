Our enterprise learning platform is used by some of the largest companies in the world (Qualcomm, Walmart, HP, Visa, Twitter, etc.) to help their employees find great learning content from any source, share knowledge with their peers, and track their progress towards career goals - and we&#x27;ve wrapped it all up into an experience that employees actually love to use.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a skilled Backend Engineer to join the team. Our backend isn&#x27;t your typical Rails system - we serve up a GraphQL API to power our client apps, which frees our backend team from the tedium of writing a ton of disposable endpoints entangled with view logic... instead, we focus on different tasks: designing our database for performance, integrating with a variety of external services, and architecting our overall platform for security, availability, and all those other good things!<p>If you&#x27;re interested, contact neville@pathgather.com, apply to the careers link below, drop a comment here, etc.<p>BACKEND ENGINEER (Ruby&#x2F;Postgres&#x2F;GraphQL), $100-130k, 0.1-0.5%, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;pathgather&#x2F;e700098b-b552-4b10-a5a5-e0e1e49a4154?lever-source=hn\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;pathgather&#x2F;e700098b-b552-4b10-a5a5-e0e...</a>","time":1478017748,"type":"comment"}
