We help sales people manage their outbound processes at large scales, and try to do so in a way that allows sales people to express sincerity and empathy.<p>SalesLoft is a culture-first company and we very much value positive, supportive, and self-starting candidates &#x2F; employees.<p>We are looking for full stack software engineers, although that doesn&#x27;t mean that you would need to come being extremely knowledgeable in both front-end and back-end development. Some of our employees are stronger on one or the other but looking to grow. We also have some positions open for other roles in our engineering organization (basically any role you can think of, we&#x27;re probably hiring in some capacity).<p>Feel free to shoot me an email with your resume, LinkedIn URL, and GitHub account if you are interested.
