We’re looking for talented programmers -- preferably with some knowledge of typed functional languages and *NIX systems programming -- to join our small tech team to make this a reality. It’s a challenging role, working on hard problems, but the chance to work with a top technical team and shape a company and product from an early stage.<p>We’re funded by top-tier infrastructure investors from the West Coast, and the founders are both technical and ex-YC &#x2F; academia. Salaries are competitive and include generous stock options. EU applicants welcome (other visas potentially possible), although roles are onsite only.<p>We’re looking at a range of positions and experience levels - whether you’ve just left uni or been hacking for 20 years, if you’re interested please get in touch.
