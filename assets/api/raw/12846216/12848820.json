Some technologies we use on a daily basis: Scala, Akka (cluster, http, fsm, pubsub, many more), Play, Docker, Mongo, PostgreSQL and Jenkins. We also have some Clojure and Ruby sprinkled around, and we&#x27;re looking to introduce some more of both. We like functional programming and hopefully you do too! Other teams have an array of services that we can take advantage of like Mesos, Kafka, Spark, Cassandra, Zookeeper, ELK, Hadoop, etc. Ideally you&#x27;ll have plenty of hands-on Scala and Akka experience, but a strong Java background is ok too. You need to have experience working with distributed systems too.<p>PulsePoint (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pulsepoint.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pulsepoint.com</a>) | Senior Full-Stack Engineer (Scala, JavaScript) | New York, NY | Full-time, remote or onsite\nSimilar role to the above, but we&#x27;d expect you to have senior-level JavaScript experience.
