We measure our success first by the number of cleaners that want to work with us, and second by the number of satisfied customers who keep booking them week after week. We have created some world-first technologies to grow these numbers month after month, and to increase our efficiency as we scale.<p>We&#x27;ve got good foundational tools in place, built over two years by two full-time, full-stack web developers. You would be the third pillar of the team, joining early enough to influence tool-choice and architecture as we go forward. We&#x27;re looking for someone who can work with us as an equal, working on new features from day one.<p>Our stack:<p>- Python, Django, Django Rest Framework<p>- PostgreSQL (including PostGIS for its advanced geographic modelling capabilities)<p>- AngularJS<p>- A hybrid mobile app for cleaners developed using Ionic on top of Cordova<p>Experience in any of these technologies would be a plus, but we&#x27;re more interested in your track record of building great products for the web.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in hearing more about what we&#x27;re doing, our economics and growth, and the kinds of things you might get to work on, email me. I&#x27;m the CTO and you&#x27;d be talking to me directly. We don&#x27;t use any recruiters.<p>gareth.lloyd (at) housekeep (dot) com","time":1478023999,"type":"comment"}
