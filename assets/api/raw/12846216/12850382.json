The rate that a startup learns is what drives it&#x27;s success. We want to hire people who can help us learn faster.<p>If you&#x27;ve ever worked at a business which sells to other businesses (or if you&#x27;ve been a contractor yourself) you&#x27;ll appreciate the pain that comes with getting your customers to pay promptly. We solve that pain, as soon as a company has issued their customer an invoice we can advance them the money (the companies then pay us back when their own customer pays them) so they have it instantly so they can pay their own suppliers and staff on time.<p>Our users love us. We have one of the highest NPS scores in the financial sector and our users keep coming back to us. We&#x27;re currently financing over Â£1m&#x2F;day and we&#x27;re the largest startup in this space worldwide.<p>We want to press the accelerator pedal on our growth but we know we need to make smart decisions in order to enable that. Whether that&#x27;s picking the right KPIs for product decisions, segmenting our customer base or modelling the credit limit we can extend to a user.<p>We&#x27;ve made two hires from HN. Email me at i.ghory@marketinvoice.com if you&#x27;re interested in any of our roles.","time":1478037268,"type":"comment"}
