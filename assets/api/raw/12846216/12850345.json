We do this by developing career site analytics and tools to manage online ad campaigns for job openings. Our software looks at web traffic, advertising cost data, applicant tracking systems, and more to answer questions about the performance of jobs and the behavior of candidates.<p>We’re looking to hire a mid-level software engineer on our data engineering team. You’ll be designing and developing our attribution model in Java using Apache Spark. You will hammer tons of data into Elasticsearch, Redshift, and S3. Together, we will explore a number of new AWS offerings, and learn what works and what doesn’t. You’ll engage with our ops team, figuring out why clusters had problems and tuning them for performance.<p>We wear many hats but are still primarily software engineers, and we want you to help us build the algorithms that power our analytics.<p>Sound interesting?
