PubPub is a free and open tool for collaborative editing, instant publishing, continuous review, and grassroots journals. You can read more about the mission of PubPub at: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pubpub.org&#x2F;pub&#x2F;hello\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pubpub.org&#x2F;pub&#x2F;hello</a>.<p>We are looking for a product designer to join us for a few design sprints. For most of these problems we already have the feature built and overall design philosophy and ideas done, we are looking for help in designing the interactions and making them pixel perfect, as well as turning these design ideas into primitives that can be used consistently in our design. A general outline of our design guide can be found here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubpub.github.io&#x2F;pubpub-design-guide&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubpub.github.io&#x2F;pubpub-design-guide&#x2F;</a><p>The ideal candidate thinks of themselves as a UI and UX designer comfortable working anywhere from wireframes to high fidelity mockups (CSS is a bonus). No coding experience is needed but the ability to work closely with developers and iterate on designs is key. Remote candidates are welcome!<p>An example of a target of a design sprint would be the &#x27;header&#x27; data in a publication (a GIF of which is found here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;g.recordit.co&#x2F;7TAT5qixzm.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;g.recordit.co&#x2F;7TAT5qixzm.gif</a>).<p>Please send us a short introduction and demonstration of your work (behance profile, dribbble profile, PDFs, etc) to pubpub-careers@media.mit.edu!","time":1478014654,"type":"comment"}
