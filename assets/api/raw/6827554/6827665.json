We are also looking for people to help us build our whitelabel eyewear software, and iterate on new UX features - we do a lot of AngularJS.<p>Our stack is Python (Flask) and MongoDB [1]. Including bits of Celery, nginx, and uwsgi. We do a lot of integration with the UPS (in fact, we maintain an open-source UPS library [2]).<p>We&#x27;re building our API and internal dashboards (which we use heavily to process orders, eyewear prescriptions, customer information, gift cards, etc.) We white-label eyewear for other fashion brands; Classic Specs and Steven Alan are some of our brands.
