That&#x27;s why we only support IE8+ (and yes, we actually mean that). No more clearfixes and negative margins here! Nutonian is looking for talented web developers help build our cutting edge application using modern iterations of front end technologies (HTML5, CSS3, without modernizr!). Our application is changing how people interact with and understand their data, and we need brilliant developers to help us realize this vision. We use the following technology stack: PureCSS, Snap.svg, backbone, handlebars, gruntjs, nodejs, casperjs and phantom.<p>Front End Developer: <a href=\"http://www.nutonian.com/company/careers/front-end-dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nutonian.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;careers&#x2F;front-end-dev&#x2F;</a><p>We are looking for engineers to architect and build the core application logic of our flagship application which allows our customers interact with their data in ways they can only dream of today. We strive daily to create beautiful code using modern software development methods, and you should too. We are a group of intelligent and motivated people at an early stage company pushing people&#x27;s understanding of what an application delivered via a web browser can be. Our current technology stack includes jquery, backbone, underscore, handlebars, nodejs, gruntjs, casper, phantomjs, C&#x2F;C++, and a smattering of QT.<p>Feel free to send along resume&#x27;s and questions to nick@nutonian.com","time":1385921935,"type":"comment"}
