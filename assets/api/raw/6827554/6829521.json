Most of the projects are not yet public though.<p>We use Go, Redis, Riak, ElasticSearch in the backend and we are probably going to use Angular (or a similar framework) for the frontend.<p>We also do some C, Obj-C, Java and C# development for VLC on iOS&#x2F;Android&#x2F;WP, and that code is always open sourced.<p>We would prefer people in Paris for the Go and Frontend developers, but we&#x27;re open to other options. For the other positions, remote is fine.<p>Contact me by email: jb@videolan.org","time":1385934497,"type":"comment"}
