INTERN or REMOTE are both welcome!<p><pre><code>  ===========================\n  ====== What we do =========\n  ===========================</code></pre>\nWe&#x27;re Waze for Cargo. Building hardware to put inside of shipping containers so our customers get realtime visibility into their supply chain. We&#x27;re then taking the info we get from the hardware and figuring out where the bottlenecks in the supply chain are, predicting whether or not a shipment is going to make it to its destination on time, and dynamically rerouting&#x2F;rescheduling shipments so that we can optimize the system as a whole. Really neat stuff.<p><pre><code>  ===========================\n  ===== How we do it ========\n  ===========================</code></pre>\nWeb stack -&gt; clojure (immutant) + HANA (really scary database on crack) -- we use middleman + enlive (and a bit of hiccup) for templating<p>Algorithms -&gt; a dizzying mixture of oldschool and newschool techniques ;-)<p>Hardware -&gt; prototyped with arduino, still using atmel uC but no longer arduino-ey. Manufacture-ready. In the process of sourcing for large scale manufacturing. Have some pilots running.<p><pre><code>  ===========================\n  ====== And the rest =======\n  ===========================</code></pre>\nWe&#x27;ve got some very interesting partners and customers (ranging from telcos to enterprise software providers to regional and international logistics companies).<p>Looking for help at every point in the system (hardware, firmware, frontend, backend, algorithms, mobile, etc).\nIf this sounds interesting, please shoot me an email at marc@weft.io!","time":1385911438,"type":"comment"}
