Now we&#x27;re working on doing the same thing again, for a different niche.  We have access to the impressive resources of the Twitch juggernaut, but Justin.tv is still a small and largely independent group, so we get to make our own rules when we want to get things done quickly.  It&#x27;s easily the most fun I&#x27;ve had in my career, and I think the other guys on our team would say the same.<p>Contact: bill@justin.tv<p>More information: <a href=\"http://www.jobscore.com/jobs/justintv/full-stack-software-engineer/barWKYuJ0r47u0eJe9fLhG?name=LinkedIn&amp;sid=69\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jobscore.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;justintv&#x2F;full-stack-software-en...</a>","time":1385912530,"type":"comment"}
