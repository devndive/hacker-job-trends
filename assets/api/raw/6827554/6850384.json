We turn excess stuff into cash for charities, tax deductions for donors, and bargains for shoppers. It&#x27;s a way for shoppers and charity supporters to do good, and for charities to engage supporters without asking for money. Item donors receive tax receipts for 100 percent of the value of their donations, prepaid shipping labels, free shipping supplies, and free pickup from the United States Postal Service (USPS). Any registered 501(c)(3) charity can partner with WebThriftStore to open its own dedicated online store, with no up-front or subscription fees. WebThriftStore is privately owned and is headquartered in New York City.","time":1386192829,"type":"comment"}
