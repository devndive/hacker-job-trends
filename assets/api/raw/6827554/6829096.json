Our partners include ESPN, LinkedIn, VH1, Extra, CBC, and others. Our CEO previously started and sold StubHub. Our mission is to connect people through conversation. We believe that people obtain a deeper understanding of each other and a more emotional connection when they interact face-to-face.<p>Our upcoming app sends and receives video and audio in real time. We use lots of custom code since the iOS SDK does not support real time video. We&#x27;re looking for engineers to join the iOS team. We&#x27;re also looking for an iOS Team Lead.<p>We&#x27;re always interested in generalist engineers as well, even though we don&#x27;t have a job ad out. So if you&#x27;re really good, send me an email (robert@spreecast.com)<p>More info at <a href=\"http://about.spreecast.com/jobs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.spreecast.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a>","time":1385929214,"type":"comment"}
