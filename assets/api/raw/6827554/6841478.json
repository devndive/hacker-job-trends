This is why we encourage work&#x2F;life balance, offer flexible vacation policies, full benefits, and an endless supply of razors and shave cream. (Oh-we also don&#x27;t have any policies about beards or facial hair, a great mustache is appreciated here).<p>Feel free to reach out to lwillming@harrys.com if you&#x27;re interested in being a part of this awesome team.","time":1386089823,"type":"comment"}
