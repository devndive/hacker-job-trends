{"by":"EmilLondon","id":6827708,"parent":6827554,"text":"Citymapper (London, UK)<p>We&#x27;re looking for great people first and foremost, but here are some of the things we make:<p>* Client experiences that people love. We have iOS, Android, and web apps.<p>* An omnivorous transport data processor. We fuse together loads of data sources (of wildly varying quality) to give people the information they need in a growing number of cities around the world. We use a lot of Python.<p>* A fast, scalable stable of servers. We have a large user base which relies on us to give them snappy answers every day. We use Saltstack.<p>* A psychic city brain. We&#x27;re digging up patterns in urban data to tell people the answers they need to know about their commute before they know the questions.<p>If you want to help us with these things and other yet-to-be revealed madcap schemes, we want to hear from you!<p><a href=\"http://citymapper.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;citymapper.com&#x2F;jobs</a>","time":1385913044,"type":"comment"}
