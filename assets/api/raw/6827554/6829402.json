(This is my third startup -- I was on the founding team of Hotline, whose chat software was used by millions of people (even Dave Morin told me he was a &quot;huge&quot; Hotline user) and by companies like Apple; the Toronto Star called it &quot;a major force in the online world&quot; at the time.)<p>Now, I&#x27;m working on a mobile startup launching first on iOS and we&#x27;re looking for an awesome iOS developer. We&#x27;re stealth and I can&#x27;t reveal details publicly because we&#x27;re required to be under the radar while being considered for launching publicly at a major tech conference in SF attended by 8,000 people, but contact me if you&#x27;re an iOS developer and I can send you more details, and we can talk!<p>CONTACT: dcm@davidcmurphy.me \n(a brief note &amp; link to your online profiles (LinkedIn&#x2F;GitHub&#x2F;etc) (or just sending a resume) is fine -- we emphasize speed over makework!)<p>PS: my thesis in college was literally about companies that treat workers well. I really care about being a great guy to work with, and think this will be a really awesome opportunity. :)","time":1385933027,"type":"comment"}
