We're building the true social network, backed by the address book. We do an incredible amount of intensive computations, but everyone we have showed the product to is surprised by how we've managed to keep the UI beautiful, simple and focused. We like to think we're a dream home for a designer, as every one of our 5 engineers all implement PSDs to the pixel. We're looking for someone who has designed iOS/Mac apps before, and has a keen eye for pixel perfection.<p>You'll be challenged on a daily basis to make our complex algorithms look simple to the end user. MG Siegler wrote a great post on us, which has a little more info about Everyme[1]. We're launching in 10 days, and have raised $1.5m from CrunchFund and others (Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock, SV Angel). To apply, please email oliver at everyme dot com with some of your previous work.<p>1. <a href=\"http://parislemon.com/post/11647475506/your-true-social-network\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://parislemon.com/post/11647475506/your-true-social-netw...</a>","time":1333300259,"type":"comment"}
