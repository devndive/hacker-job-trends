Applicants should have a good understanding and hands on knowledge of Java, Javascript, Python, HTML/CSS, XML/XSLT, and SQL.\"<p>That official list of skills is more of a wishlist.<p>A few parts of our product are written in C++, so it'd be nice if you could understand it enough for testing. I've spent a good lot of time in C, but have no C++ experience myself. Most everything else in that skill list doesn't require an in-depth expertise, other than Java. Day-to-day, most of your time will be spent in Java.<p>What do we do?
