Our story is similar to the guys at Yipit, ie, our team consists of two non-coders that learned to code in the last couple of months and used some freelancing help to launch our MVP (our official launch will be this week).<p>In the meantime we also were selected to incubate at Instituto GÃªnesis, which is brazilian's top startup incubator, at PUC-Rio university. And we're about to close our first round of financing.<p>Post-launch we're looking for a Rails developer to join our team and help us run faster. Being able to move to Rio would be a big plus, but we practice the 37signals' philosophy so it's fine if you prefer to work remotely. The compensation for this position includes salary plus significant equity.<p>If you're interested in the position please email me: robertoriccio1 at gmail.","time":1333988888,"type":"comment"}
