We use single-cell RNA sequencing to discover and understand all the cell types of the mouse brain. We have published very well (Science, Nature, etc) and have just been funded to map every cell type in the mouse nervous system. This is an incredibly exciting project: for the first time, we will be able to say exactly what types of cells exist in every brain region, and which genes are specifically active in those cells. We have great funding for the next five years.<p>Now, I&#x27;m looking for a front-end programmer with some back-end skills to help build a data portal to share our data with the scientific community.<p>* Work in our team in Stockholm, Sweden<p>* Work with people from all over the world (English is our working language)<p>* Help us do groundbreaking science!<p>* Ok salary, great Swedish employment benefits<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone who can build an UI, with tools for visualising and browsing a very large and complex dataset.
