We’re a group of about 20 people, all remote, about half of that is dev. We’re looking for a solid front-end developer who can help us build the next generation of our platform. SpatialKey is a mapping and data-vis app, targeting the insurance industry. We can tell an insurance company how many buildings they have in the path of an oncoming hurricane, or what the flood risk is at a given location, or how much damage the worst theoretical tornado strike can do to their portfolio.<p>Historically we’ve had a large codebase built on Adobe Flex. We’re in the process of rebuilding the next version in HTML, with React&#x2F;Flux as the primary framework. You would be heavily involved in that new HTML&#x2F;JS development. Experience developing and shipping complex enterprise HTML&#x2F;JS apps in a team environment is a must. Solid knowledge of CSS, JS fundamentals, Node and npm as dev tools, etc. Prior work with React would be nice but is not required.<p>We’re a fully self-funded profitable company. We haven’t taken a dime in VC funding and are growing based on the old fashioned idea that we produce valuable software and we sell that software for money (imagine that!). No advertising, no fake it till you make it Silicon Valley BS. We’ve been around for 8 years and have an extremely stable customer base and growth prospects. We’re proud of what we build and stand behind quality software.<p>To apply email jobs@spatialkey.com or email me directly at doug.mccune@spatialkey.com. We’ll have an official job posting online soon, but for now shoot us an email and say hi. We&#x27;re fully remote but it&#x27;s a lot easier for us to hire candidates in the USA.","time":1451679578,"type":"comment"}
