I realize that adtech isn&#x27;t the most world changing industry but in terms of engineering knowledge and dealing with all elements of the tech stack it&#x27;s pretty incredible and a good place to be.<p>There was also a post here on website bloat and we do try to keep things lean and simple - our goal is to strike that perfect balance between content consumers, publishers, and advertisers and we realize the industry&#x27;s in a pretty crappy spot right now and are trying to make it better.<p>Definitely reach out if you have questions: dgoldin@triplelift.com<p>Edit: Languages are Java, Scala, Python, JavaScript, some R, some PHP.","time":1451668576,"type":"comment"}
