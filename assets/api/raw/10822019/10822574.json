Our business is gaining substantial momentum so we&#x27;re hoping you&#x27;re as excited about the challenges of scaling for success as we are.<p>* Company Summary<p>Linkable Networks was founded on the premise that the disconnect between digital media and physical retail was a major gap in delivering a great experience to consumers. Since 2011, we’ve been nose-down building a scalable platform that provides brands and retailers the ability to engage, reward and incent their consumers directly and across any channel – online, mobile and in-store. We pioneered the concept of card-linked-offers and have taken it to the next level – always-on loyalty. Both our self-service and SaaS-based platforms enable the creation of actionable ads, coupons, offers, promotions, rebates and more that let you reward loyalty... not just discount a purchase. This is the future of Loyalty.<p>If this sounds interesting, please shoot me an email at coolgigs@linkablenetworks.com","time":1451671087,"type":"comment"}
