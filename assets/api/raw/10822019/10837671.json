We have a large pool of workers, and set of workflows, and a stream of inbound tasks. We want to take our fledgling data science efforts to the next level by:\n - building a new backend that captures granular event data everywhere\n - automate and semi-automate a lot of our decision making (who gets assigned to what task, when to adjust workflows based on risk, etc)\n - support more service offerings (we have thousands of team members in 150+ countries, what else could they help with?)<p>We need a technical leader for this effort. this will include mentoring engineers, architecting our stack, and having major influence over processes used and product direction.<p>Looking for someone who has designed and built a reasonably large system in either python or ruby, though we don&#x27;t have to use either this time. (I want the shared perspective).<p>Looking for someone who has strong opinions on how to use devops, CI, and unit testing effectively, how to manage technical debt, and how to build reasonably scalable architectures while preserving developer productivity.<p>Plan to be hands on with development in the early days, with potential to focus more on either leadership and mentoring or technical pathfinding and design as the project unfolds, depending on your inclination.<p>I am the hiring manager.
