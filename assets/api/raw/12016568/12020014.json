It was bought by Americans, moved manufacturing in China, but continues to misleadingly and deceptively use the word &quot;Australia&quot; in it&#x27;s brand. Then further still, it started suing anyone <i>IN</i> Australia who uses the word Ugg, which was, and remains, a completely generic term in the Aussies vernacular.  Besides that, their boots are now poor quality and fall apart.  If I had been considering working for you, I would have had to blacklist you for working with such a jerk of a customer.  Get rid of those scum.","time":1467410466,"type":"comment"}
