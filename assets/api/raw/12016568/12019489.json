This is an experiment.<p>We built an open source platform like Facebook, but decentralized, that lets developers build apps which communities will install. What Wordpress did for blogs, Qbix Platform does for social.<p>We&#x27;re not fans of full-time employment, especially not on-site. We prefer to work in a decentralized manner, relying on our tools and systems (version control, project tracker, email, etc.) to get things done. Our motto is <i>&quot;People live lives. Companies create products.&quot;</i><p>So we are not hiring anyone for full-time work. It is more of a super-accelerator, with 90% done for you. Instead of selling your time for money in order to build value for a corporation, we will set you up with your own company for your project. You will own 15% of the company, with Qbix and other team members owning the rest.<p>With this structure, you do not have to be a US citizen. You will be a part owner in a joint venture. You would be in charge of working with your team and making decisions together. The companh would pay salaries to the team, and you would have 15% of any dividends or disbursements.<p>For more information, visit <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;qbix.com&#x2F;platform\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;qbix.com&#x2F;platform</a> and shoot us an email.","time":1467405744,"type":"comment"}
