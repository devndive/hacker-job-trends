The moral imperative of our company is to use technology to help the private sector and regulators re-engineer the infrastructure of capital markets to make it more transparent, less centralised, and resilient to counterparty failure.<p>Our technology stack enables distributed automation of post-trade processes, allowing dealers, end-users, and other members of the capital markets ecosystem to process trades through light-weight, consortium-governed Decentralised Clearing Networks (DCN&#x27;s) rather than centralised post-trade intermediaries.<p>Weâ€™re a fast growing startup with paying clients, an open source software business model and a lucrative target market. This brings a number of benefits, including a high level of autonomy, a flat and intimate team structure, and a lack of bureaucracy. The Clearmatics team is small but experienced, driven by motivated people who want to build innovative solutions for a market undergoing rapid change since the financial crisis.<p>Senior Front-End Engineer <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clearmatics.workable.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;255835\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clearmatics.workable.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;255835</a><p>Senior UX Designer\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clearmatics.workable.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;274769\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clearmatics.workable.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;274769</a>","time":1467637195,"type":"comment"}
