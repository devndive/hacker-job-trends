You&#x27;ll be a full Member of Technical Staff, working with the product development team, with full benefits from day one.<p>This is a great job for someone energized by the possibilities offered by programming, but less excited about chasing down weird text-encoding corner cases and poring over billing code. You will be consistently challenged and engaged by diverse and interesting problems. You&#x27;ll use a constantly changing tool set to solve a constantly changing array of problems. There&#x27;s room for coding in this position, but you don&#x27;t have to be a coder to succeed in it.&quot;<p>Interview process: Once you solve our Application Problem, the stages of the interview process are: resume review, phone screen, and a day of interviews.","time":1467393477,"type":"comment"}
