Projects include: classification models to guess whether someone is visiting a store or walking by, streams for real-time alerts, simulating store traffic, helping clients improve their staffing, and calculating cross visitors across different stores. Much of our work involves figuring out how to make these calculations work in an efficient, distributed way across large datasets.<p>Interview process: Intro call with our tech recruiter, a phone interview with a hiring manager and a take-home technical assessment. This is followed up by a day of onsite interviews that will most likely include probability&#x2F;stats questions, a deep dive on your take-home exercise answers, a data manipulation question, and lunch.
