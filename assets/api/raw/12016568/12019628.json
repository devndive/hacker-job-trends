You&#x27;ll be given tons of responsibility and ownership of projects that span from UI widgets and completely new views to implementing and designing new APIs. Since our team is still small there is still time to define how we build software and we expect that you will make a big impact on those decisions. We are fully invested in React on the frontend and Scala on the backend (but no Scala experience needed).<p>You can find more about us on our website <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;actioniq.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;actioniq.com</a> or read a couple of our blogs about what we&#x27;ve been working on: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.actioniq.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.actioniq.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;</a><p>Apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;actioniq.workable.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;93107\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;actioniq.workable.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;93107</a> or email jobs at actioniq.com","time":1467407035,"type":"comment"}
