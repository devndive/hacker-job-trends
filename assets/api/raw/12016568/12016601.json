The project consists of developing web applications with functionality ranging from visualizing terabytes of biological data to fine grained interrogation of disease­ causing mutations that open the world of complex genomic analysis to medical professionals and scientists with limited or no experience in computational analysis. These applications are built on our technology stack, consisting of a node web service backend, which streams analysis results via websockets to the web applications, where results are visualized using D3.<p>The successful applicant will be involved in further developing the iobio framework (client libraries and server), building new web apps, creating new visualizations, and hardening current web apps. Remuneration will include both a competitive salary and stock in Frameshift Genomics.
