We&#x27;re headquartered in Salt Lake City, UT but have engineering offices in Chicago and Seattle and allow remote work from home (a significant portion of our company is remotely distributed and working from home, so we&#x27;re very remote-friendly).<p>We&#x27;re an engineering-driven culture that&#x27;s actively hiring for the following positions:<p><pre><code>    - Senior software engineer (can be remote)\n    - Android engineer (must be onsite initially)\n    - QA engineers (must be onsite initially)\n</code></pre>\nOur primary stack is Rails &amp; React, but we&#x27;re not afraid to branch out and give you the independence to try new things. We have quarterly hack weeks, internal tech conferences, customers (like Harvard, Stanford, Tesla, Slack, etc) who love us, and challenging engineering problems. Oh, and the benefits are amazing too :)<p>I&#x27;m an engineer at Instructure, and genuinely love the culture and people here. I would highly recommend it!<p>Apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;instructure?lever-via=NiHimSaI8r\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;instructure?lever-via=NiHimSaI8r</a><p>Feel free to reach out to me at neil(at)instructure(dot)com with any questions.","time":1467401606,"type":"comment"}
