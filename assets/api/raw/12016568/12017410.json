Governments use our tools to save time and money and then publish their laws openly for the public.<p>The founders are two lawyer&#x2F;programmers (Scala, Python, and Javascript). Our funding is a mix of donations, grants, and government contracts.<p>If you are looking for a meaningful way to contribute to our democracy, you find joy in building the perfect tools for your users, you like deep and challenging problems in such diverse areas as version control, DSL design, UI&#x2F;UX, and NLP (more accurately, LLP - Legal Language Processing :), and the idea of helping build a team excites you, then drop me a line at dgreisen@openlawlib.org.<p>* C# Lead Developer: Government lawyers live and breath MS Office, so our tools must integrate seamlessly with their MS-centric workflows. We are looking to hire a C# lead to help us build out our Microsoft team.<p>* Javascript&#x2F;Python Developer: Our development environment for editing and publishing legal documents is based on the Atom editor. You will be integrating Atom with our existing Python backend and building all new tools, either in Atom plugins or in our Python backend, as appropriate.","time":1467389997,"type":"comment"}
