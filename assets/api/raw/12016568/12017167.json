We solve deep technical challenges and are building offerings relevant to interesting real-world problems in a variety of fields. We are currently open to engineers with solid experience in CUDA, Mesos, deep neural networks, and&#x2F;or Clojure, as well as to enthusiastic developers who might lack this precise experience but are eager to learn. We also welcome interest from postdoctoral researchers or senior graduate students. We are interested in solving problems efficiently, and our polyglot architecture includes C++, Clojure, Scala, and Python.<p>We do not presently have openings for undergraduates (B.Sc. students).<p>Contact info@onutechnology.com.","time":1467388476,"type":"comment"}
