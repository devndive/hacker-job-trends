I need someone to help with marketing a new technology product I&#x27;m building. I&#x27;m interested in an equity partner rather than an employee, but a contractor is OK too. The product is in the reputation space. I&#x27;m located in Boston, but any remote person is OK, provided you speak English and know about marketing. I can provide more details over a phone call.
