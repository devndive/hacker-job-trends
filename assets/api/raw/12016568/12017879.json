Most of our micro services are written in Elixir, our language of choice for all the new stuff, we also have some Ruby and a bit of Python in production besides a legacy Symfony 2 application. On the front end side we&#x27;re using React&#x2F;Redux.\nWe have a lot of automation in place, we run a pretty comprehensive test suite on CircleCI and BrowserStack at every push and every developer can spin up QA environments that mirror our entire stack for a feature branch. All of this allows us to confidently deploy to production multiple times per day.
