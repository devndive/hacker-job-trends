We create web-based tools that help investment banks use data to automate workflows and sell fixed income and equity securities.<p>You can very loosely think of us as an Angelist for institutional investors. Every month, $10-20 billion of financings are exclusively marketed through our platform (Angelist did $150 million in 2015). We work with all the leading bulge bracket investment banks (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Citi, JPM, Barclays, etc) and hundreds of the nations leading corporations like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ford, Hyundai, etc.<p>We are bootstrapped and profitable and believe we are in a very unique position to significantly impact an extremely valuable segment of Wall Street (new issue offerings).<p>What We&#x27;re Looking For: Full stack is ideal but we are flexible. Most important for us is someone who enjoys coding and is self-organized. We are a very lean team and need a lot of help - we don&#x27;t have bandwidth to do a lot of hand holding so we need people excited about taking ownership over their work. We have great clients who are supportive and we have a roadmap that can easily get us into 2017. We know what we need to do, need help doing it...<p>Stack:\nFront-end: angular and express\nBackend: laravel, php, node.js \nDatabase: MYSQL \nDeployments: chef and docker<p>Interview Process:\n1. Resume screen\n2. Phone screen with hiring manager\n3. Onsite interview with team (expect some technicals)\n4. Done.<p>Contact:\nleo@finsight.com\njordan@finsight.com","time":1467392275,"type":"comment"}
