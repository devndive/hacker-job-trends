Credit cards impose a hidden tax on everything. The profit margin of your average neighborhood store is under 2%. A typical grocery store’s operating margin is around 1.7%. On the other hand, the typical cost of processing all payments is about 2%. As Priceonomics puts it, &quot;Credit card fees are 2% or more of nearly pure profit.&quot;<p>There has been many innovations built on top of the existing credit card network, but none of those fundamentally changes the equation. Kash is changing the equation.<p>With the former CEO of Visa leading our board, and all the momentum we&#x27;re seeing, we&#x27;re confident that a new network can be built. Come chat with us to learn more if you think this is a worthy cause.<p>We currently use: GCE&#x2F;AWS, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, Docker, Kubernetes,\nAngular.js, React, Objective-C for iOS, Android\nWe&#x27;re looking for engineers with a demonstrated ability to learn and past experience building both scalable and maintainable software.<p>For more details and to apply, please visit <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;withkash.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;withkash.com&#x2F;careers</a>.
