That&#x27;s why we build technology that connects people to doctors and dispensaries instantly from the comfort of home, so patients can get their medicine delivered quickly and safely.<p>We’re looking for passionate, talented, and innovative contributors to join our diverse, world-class team and help shape history. We’re serious about making a positive impact and improving the quality of life for both patients and employees.<p>* Senior Back End Engineer (C#&#x2F;.NET and Node.js)<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;eaze&#x2F;b3f8d324-afb9-4e06-9ac8-24e1c1bb793a\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;eaze&#x2F;b3f8d324-afb9-4e06-9ac8-24e1c1bb7...</a><p>The Role<p>As a back end engineer, you’ll help shape the platform that powers the Eaze web and mobile apps. We like to iterate quickly, so engineers are involved early in the product design process. Once we begin prototyping and moving towards release, you’ll own and ship your own code on infrastructure you help automate and maintain. You’ll be involved in each step of the process from design to deployment, including monitoring and scaling.<p>What We’re Looking For<p>Our core JSON API and many of our supporting tools are written in Javascript and C#, so having experience with Node.js or .NET is a plus. Have no fear if you’re not an expert in either of these—we love engineers who can rapidly learn the right language or tool in order to solve the problem at hand. Some of our ongoing challenges include real-time driver tracking and routing, dynamic product suggestions and of course scaling our system to accommodate our exponentially growing user base.<p>* Senior Mobile Engineer (iOS and Android)<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;eaze&#x2F;4ca30aac-4b71-4e79-97cb-53707f24bdd0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;eaze&#x2F;4ca30aac-4b71-4e79-97cb-53707f24b...</a><p>The Role<p>As our first mobile engineer, you&#x27;ll be in on the ground floor of all of our mobile initiatives. We have two driver apps (one for Android and one for iOS), a tele-health app to get your doctors recommendation over video chat, and we&#x27;re starting to explore consumer facing options for the marketplace itself.<p>What We&#x27;re Looking For<p>We have a wide range of mobile apps on both of the main mobile platforms, so having experience with building applications for both iOS and Android is a plus. If you&#x27;re stronger in one or the other, that&#x27;s fine too - the team is growing quickly and we&#x27;ll likely need to specialize soon. We&#x27;re looking for someone who is a self starter with experience in all aspects of the mobile stack - data management, network, and UI.","time":1467390500,"type":"comment"}
