We think, create, and market our own apps. We&#x27;re young (3 years of activity, average age 27 years old), but we&#x27;ve achieved explosive growth: the apps that we&#x27;ve invented, developed, and published have been downloaded more than 40 million times, and millions of people use them every week. We are currently looking for an exceptional Software Engineer to join our team of backend and iOS engineers. Our backend stack consists for the most part of Python, node.js, MongoDB, and Redis. Our iOS work is every bit as extensive and challenging as the backend one, if not more.
