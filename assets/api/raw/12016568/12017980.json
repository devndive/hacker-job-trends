We&#x27;re built on Google App Engine and embrace a NoOps philosophy - we spend every day building features for our customers instead of maintaining systems. The two technical cofounders (I&#x27;m one of them) are former Pivots and we&#x27;ve embraced much of Pivotal Labs&#x27; philosophy, including TDD and pair programing.<p>Our interview process is a 30 minute skype call followed by a 2-hour pair programming session with me in our downtown SF office, and I&#x27;ll tell you immediately whether or not you will be getting an offer. We have all the traditional employee perks including medical, dental, take-what-you-need vacation.
