We build an object storage system capable of safely storing many petabytes of data and effectively managing the ecosystem of machines, devices, and drives that it takes to do so.  We do all of this on commodity hardware so that companies can build out storage behind their firewall in a way that is both cost-effective and optimized for them personally.<p>Some relevant info:<p>* Our stack is primarily Python with some Go, but we know you can learn those things if you don’t know them already.<p>* Our headquarters is in San Francisco, and we have a small office in San Jose as well.<p>* We have a small team that punches way above its weight class.<p>* We love open source.  Our storage engine is based on OpenStack Swift, and we’re big contributors to it as well as other open source projects.<p>We’re looking for talented engineers of all stripes.  If you have a strong background in storage management, distributed systems, or devops, then we’re particularly interested, but many of our number began as very gifted web developers with a hunger to learn something new.<p>Our interview process: (1) intro with founder + entertaining technical phone screen, (2) onsite, technically focused interview that&#x27;s mostly small work-sample programming that you perform on your own computer, + meeting the team (3) there is no number 3.<p>To apply: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.swiftstack.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.swiftstack.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a><p>Thank you!","time":1464797363,"type":"comment"}
