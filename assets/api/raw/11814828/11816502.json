We&#x27;re looking for people with at least 2 years of relevant experience for the position, but we also value people who learn quickly. We&#x27;re into TDD, pairing, and CI, with the understanding that these are just tools for the job and not the be-all and end-all. We value our lives over work (we work from 10am-7pm every day, but timing is flexible), but we love our jobs and the people we work with. We&#x27;re looking for someone who likes to get stuff done, go for afternoon feelings walks (coffee + sunshine), and join in lunchtime debates about the merits of tacos (hint: they are delicious).<p>Let&#x27;s talk!
