Our vision is to build a \nbetter savings account - current solutions are too dumb and leave us to our own devices. \nWe’ve personally never been good savers even though we always had it in the back of our \nheads that we should be saving money. We’re starting with a savings assistant which \nautomatically saves money for you. It is powered by an algorithm that looks at your \nhistorical and current spending and builds a model on how to save money for you.<p>We’re looking for a smart Python engineer to help us out over the summer. It&#x27;s a paid gig \nbut you have to live in London or be willing to spend the summer here. The stack is Python, React, RabbitMQ and PostgreSQL.<p>We’re super early so there’s a lot of cool things to work on! We’re currently bootstrapping \nwhile raising an angel round. If you are interested, email alex@withplum.com with a few words about yourself and something exciting that you worked on recently.","time":1464954492,"type":"comment"}
