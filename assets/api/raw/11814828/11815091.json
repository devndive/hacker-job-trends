We&#x27;re a small company, so you&#x27;d need to be comfortable working with a variety of technologies. We&#x27;re currently growing and refreshing our systems, so there would be a good deal of both responsibility and freedom in the position. If you&#x27;d like more information please don&#x27;t hesitate to get in touch.<p>In case you&#x27;re wondering, our back-end systems use Ruby+Rails, Go, and some PHP. On the front-end we do HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS on the web, and we have native applications for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone.<p>Thanks!<p>David","time":1464794635,"type":"comment"}
