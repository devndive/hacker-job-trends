We&#x27;ve got an informal, small-team vibe, and offer flexible working arrangements. We&#x27;re looking to hire another &quot;full-stack&quot; software generalist. Our core software is a web application built with the Grails framework, so we&#x27;re looking for someone good at:<p><pre><code>    * Groovy (or some other JVM language, like Java, Scala, etc)\n    * SQL\n    * HTML&#x2F;JS&#x2F;CSS\n</code></pre>\nEven more awesome would be experience with:<p><pre><code>    * Grails\n    * MySQL\n    * Linux\n    * AWS\n    * Ansible\n</code></pre>\nYou&#x27;ll be working on a wide range of problems, like:<p><pre><code>    * constructing SQL queries to find outliers in survey responses\n    * streamlining the web UI for entering new patients into our app\n    * fashioning logic to extract relevant data from customer&#x27;s medical-record systems\n    * automating the scale up&#x2F;down of front-end servers to match demand\n</code></pre>\nEmail justin@codetechnology.com to get started -- our relaxed interview process consists of a few hour-long chats (no brain-teaser or &quot;write some code&quot; questions) with our developers, an hour-long pair-programming session, and a 4-hour take-home programming sample (as the last step).","time":1464800145,"type":"comment"}
