Today, our data and analytic models are used within over 250 investment banks, hedge funds, and academic institutions worldwide.<p>Here at OptionMetrics, you&#x27;ll work alongside a team of exceptionally creative and intelligent developers and quants, collaborating daily to brainstorm and implement our next generation of data and analytic information products.  We&#x27;re small, agile, casual (no suits -- shoes optional), and passionate about our mission and the projects we create.  And, since we are self-funded and profitable (no VC&#x27;s!), we can afford to take the long view, emphasizing quality over expediency in all we do.   As a member of our development team, you will have true ownership over your projects from beginning to end, with an emphasis on accountability over micromanagement.<p>We are currently looking for a junior - mid level software engineer to help rebuild our entire technology stack. You will have the opportunity to work with large data (billions of rows of data), build out a new web application, and have a say in the technology&#x2F;design choices.<p>We prefer someone with a Java background.<p>Please send your resume to Hubert at hchen@optionmetrics.com if you are interested.","time":1464796281,"type":"comment"}
