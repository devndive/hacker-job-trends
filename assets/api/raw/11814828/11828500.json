If you&#x27;ve got some security background, know your way around a linux box, have some coding&#x2F;architecture experience, and are not too shy to go meet a client from time to time, we would most probably like to talk to you :)<p>Fluent German is a must. Readiness to travel is optional (and I mean it. You don&#x27;t have to if you don&#x27;t want to.). If you&#x27;ve got experience with anything IAM related (be it open source or proprietary) including but not limited to OAuth, SCIM, OIDC, even just plain LDAP, that&#x27;s an advantage for you.<p>If interested, drop an email to Georgi (that&#x27;s me) with a reference to HN.
