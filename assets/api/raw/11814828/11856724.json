I am a financial engineer who left the hedge fund world to make investing easier for self-directed investors.  I am actively looking for a software engineering partner.  Ping me at john (at) commandiv (dot) com if you&#x27;re interested in learning more.<p>Hiring process: meet in person or video chat; I will demo for you the Alpha product (and build you a personalized portfolio down to the tickers &amp; # of shares to buy); we can go from there...<p>About Commandiv: \nCommandiv is an over-the-top investment advisor for self-directed investors.  Users get value from: 1) Robo-Assist trade recommendations (all advisory&#x2F;backtesting algos fully developed); 2) full control over their investments; 3) and account consolidation of all their liquid investments.  We are not a broker-dealer and donâ€™t want to be.  We plug into broker-dealer APIs and earn money from BD-paid referral fees, and user-paid advisory fees (25bps of AUM).<p>Initially, we are targeting educated, employed 26-45-year-olds who have $5-100k in cash external to their employer-sponsored retirement plans.  This target customer knows little about investing; she is self-directed and has done preliminary research; and she craves a one-stop shop to learn, build trust, and get invested.  In order to acquire customers at greater scale, we will use a Learning Platform (think: Duolingo &#x2F; TurboTax) to drive account creation (curriculum fully developed).<p>AngelList: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;commandiv\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;commandiv</a>","time":1465325121,"type":"comment"}
