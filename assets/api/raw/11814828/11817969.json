Hands on experience with building cluster management systems and job schedulers is a huge plus.  If you really care about the end user experience, even better.  This role is for a new project within the EC2 Container Services team. The team is small but will grow quickly over the next several months. Expect to work with engineers who love building services and designing APIs, and with highly customer-focused and super technical product managers.<p>You should expect to solve a written problem (administered remotely) + an onsite interview with 4-5 interviewers.<p>My contact info is in my profile. Happy to answer clarifying questions as well.","time":1464813631,"type":"comment"}
