We want developers to spend more time writing core business-logic and less time thinking about infrastructure.<p>We’re looking for our first technical hires, who will be working with us to design and implement the core platform that will make this a reality. We have a MVP in Python (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;StackHut&#x2F;stackhut);\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;StackHut&#x2F;stackhut);</a> it gives a feel for what we’re trying to build, although is only a start.<p>We’re implementing this in Haskell, and are looking for talented functional programmers preferably with some knowledge of Linux&#x2F;Unix systems programming. It’s a challenging role, working on hard problems, but the chance to work with a top technical team and shape a company and product from the get-go.<p>We’re funded by top-tier infrastructure investors from the West Coast, and the founders are highly-technical and ex-YC &#x2F; PhD. Salaries are competitive and include stock options. EU applicants welcome, although relocation would be required.
