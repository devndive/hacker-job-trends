I learned how to build millions of things during a six year tenure at Apple that culminated with leading Product Design for Apple Watch.  Instead of just making one product thinner&#x2F;cheaper&#x2F;better, we are fundamentally changing how all products are designed and built.<p>We&#x27;re making artificial intelligence for manufacturing -- enabling assembly lines that can provide actionable insights into how our customers&#x27; designs or processes can be improved – with the potential to save billions in scrap and rework costs.<p>We are dedicated to building a diverse and dynamic team of data-driven engineers who see inefficiencies as opportunities and want to develop a system that not only touches, but improves, millions of things each day.  We have revenue and are funded.  Today we are just six people -- there&#x27;s lots of opportunity here to move the needle, influence the product, and grow as an engineer!<p>We are actively seeking several software engineers to be founding members of our artificial intelligence team.  These engineers will architect, develop, and deploy scaleable, non-task specific machine learning, computer vision, and other data extraction&#x2F;correlation algorithms to generate insights about our customers’ product and manufacturing processes.<p>Would love to hear from you -- communications at dfxmachina dot com -- it goes directly to my inbox!","time":1465053328,"type":"comment"}
