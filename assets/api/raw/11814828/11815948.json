I’m posting because we are bootstrapped and profitable, and we’re hiring software engineers. To give you an idea of what you’d do, one engineer on our team wrote an API that helps print over 10,000 shirts a day. Our stack is node, react, angular, and mongo.<p>We may have already answered your questions about us on <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;scalable.press&#x2F;product-engineer&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;scalable.press&#x2F;product-engineer&#x2F;</a>. It covers hiring process, engineering culture, past projects, and future projects you might work on with us.<p>Interested? Email me and mention you’re from HN. No need to send a resume—I’d like to hear about what you’ve been working on lately, and feel free to include any relevant project links.<p>ericzhang@scalablepress.com <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;scalable.press&#x2F;product-engineer&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;scalable.press&#x2F;product-engineer&#x2F;</a><p>PS We&#x27;re also hiring a lead product designer, head of marketing, and a software engineer with a focus on warehouse automation software. If you&#x27;re into industrial processes, I would be happy to show you our 4 warehouses.<p>We posted in the May thread too and have already made a hire from HN! Just wanted to share the good news.","time":1464799663,"type":"comment"}
