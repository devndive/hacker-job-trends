Think of it like Github for marketers: there&#x27;s plenty of AWS competitors (how you ship), but there&#x27;s no place you go to to <i>do</i> marketing on a daily basis.<p>TrackMaven is a well-funded DC startup, and we&#x27;re opening a brand new team in San Francisco to build a brand new product help marketers tie their campaigns to revenue. In the B2B world, where sales take months and it takes whole teams to buy a product, it&#x27;s a big challenge to figure out what&#x27;s really working, and the results will directly change millions of dollars in marketing budget.<p>We need one fantastic engineer to join our pre-launch team and own the frontend. We have paying customers and a sales &#x2F; account management team that can&#x27;t wait to sell this product. If you&#x27;re interested in building something where you can see the results in the next 6 months, let&#x27;s talk.<p>Tech: React, D3, Python 3","time":1464795695,"type":"comment"}
