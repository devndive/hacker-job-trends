We&#x27;re replacing clunky Excel sheets and email workflows with a beautiful and purpose-designed technology platform. Since our founding in April 2013, we&#x27;ve grown from a 3 to 90 person team, from a windowless WeWork conference room to eight offices in three countries, and today power leasing at many landmarks buildings across the US and Europe.<p>Our of our earliest investors wrote that commercial real estate is like &quot;a lost tribe in the Amazon&quot;. Although it&#x27;s not an especially charitable characterization, it describes well the scale of the opportunity. We&#x27;re essentially rebuilding the technology platform for a 13 trillion dollar global asset class. There&#x27;s a lot of roadmap yet to build :)<p>We&#x27;re organized as small, cross-discipline collaborative teams which fosters high-velocity, high-quality development and tons of customer empathy. Trust me, our customers need you :)  I&#x27;m focused on recruiting full stack developers to our team (our stack being AngularJS and Rails) and building new competencies in data science and DevOps.<p>Drop me a line if you&#x27;re interested in learning more about how we work, and what happened when a technology startup met a giant industry still playing catch up with this whole &quot;Internet&quot; thing :)<p>niall.smart (at) gethightower.com.","time":1464806889,"type":"comment"}
