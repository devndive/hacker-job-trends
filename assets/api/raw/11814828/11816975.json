Our team is composed of educators, artists, and engineers who value diversity, new ideas, and a willingness to learn.<p>We are looking for an experienced DevOps Engineer to join our small but talented web team in order to build up and scale out the infrastructure for our application. We are flexible on location and are open to a remote developer as long as you are a strong communicator and have proven experience working remotely. Our ideal candidate is an savvy sysadmin with experience working in an agile environment. You’d be coming in near the ground floor so this also has strong potential to evolve into a leadership position as the company and infrastructure continue to grow.<p>We enjoy working hard in a laid back, politics and drama free atmosphere in an office where you’ll find frequent discussions about topics from digital music generation and analysis to visual processing and machine learning.  Almost everybody at the company has music, artistic, or hobby projects that they work on on the side, so we all value our time away from the office. We want you to be passionate and believe in what we are doing, but we also know that life is too full to spend it all at work. That said, we don’t fear the occasional late night or hard push to meet a deadline, but strive to hone in our planning to prevent this from happening frequently.<p>Website: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kadenze.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kadenze.com</a><p>Full Job Posting: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kadenze.bamboohr.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;view.php?id=14\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kadenze.bamboohr.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;view.php?id=14</a>","time":1464806131,"type":"comment"}
