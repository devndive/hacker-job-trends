This increases the need for computational tools to design cells and communities of cells analogous to the tools used in Computer Aided Design (CAD) of cars, buildings and other man-made objects. The European Commission has awarded 6.3 million Euros to a four-year collaborative project to build a CAD tool for data-driven design of cells and microbial communities. Applications will range from human health to sustainable production of chemicals.<p>Our web stack currently, in no specific order: AngularJS, ECMAScript 6, Redis, Python 3, Flask, PostgreSQL 9.4, Socket.IO, Docker. The application is very front-end centric so most of the work will always be done in JavaScript. The API is written in Python and our scientists write most of their algorithms in Python. We currently use AngularJS for the front-end, however this is not set in stone.\nAs visible on our GitHub org (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;biosustain\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;biosustain</a>), we are very dedicated towards releasing most of our tools as open source software.<p>We will help with getting a VISA, as well as with administrative issues related to relocation. Our working language is English. We are a very diverse workplace; 70% of our staff have an international background.\nThe salary depends on qualifications and needs to be agreed by your union representative -- so I cannot give an official range -- but a rough personal estimate is DKK 450k-600k.<p>So if this sparked your interest, come and join a diverse team of scientists and engineers to work on something that matters.<p>To read more and apply, go to:\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biosustain.dtu.dk&#x2F;english&#x2F;About&#x2F;Vacant-Positions&#x2F;job?id=6f896202-81fa-4c84-aedf-e9e7350fb11e\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biosustain.dtu.dk&#x2F;english&#x2F;About&#x2F;Vacant-Positions&#x2F;...</a>","time":1465953573,"type":"comment"}
