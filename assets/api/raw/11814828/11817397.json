We replace existing dedicated, hardware drawing tablets that are prohibitively expensive, costing thousands of dollars. Astropad is used by creatives of all types, from hobbyists to high-end professionals working on major motion pictures.<p>To make Astropad possible we had to create our own network protocol and low-latency video codec we call Liquid. We are just getting started with Liquid and we need engineers to help us work on this next generation high quality, low-latency video technology.<p>We are looking for someone with an interest in low level programming (C, SIMD), graphics, GPU programming and compression to work on our cutting edge Liquid tech. We are also a fully remote company with a small office in Minneapolis, MN. If this sounds interesting to you, e-mail: jobs@astro-hq.com","time":1464809250,"type":"comment"}
