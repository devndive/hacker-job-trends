And the testimonials we receive every day remind us that our impact isn&#x27;t just about big numbers — access to free education meaningfully changes the lives of people in all sorts of situations.

We use our data to personalize students&#x27; learning and continually improve our content. We&#x27;re trying to build a strong, diverse team — and we need more help.<p>We&#x27;ve made some great hires off HN and would love to make more.
