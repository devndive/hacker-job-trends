We&#x27;re building a centralized delivery platform to support the 200,000 food deliveries made each day in NYC. Our software is running in restaurants around the city and is used to coordinate thousands of deliveries across our fleet of couriers every day.<p>We&#x27;re looking to bring on a full-stack engineer to help us build out our platform. We currently use Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, Node.js and Angular, but we&#x27;re open to all languages and skills--bonus points for interest in Elixir and Go! We&#x27;re also in the process of migrating our infrastructure to Kubernetes, so experience with AWS and Docker is a plus.<p>The engineering team is still very small (there&#x27;s only 4 of us), so you&#x27;ll have a lot of ownership on the projects you work on and have a big impact on our development culture!<p>Our interview process involves a phone interview, a take-home coding challenged focused on real software development and an onsite interview where you meet the team and get feedback on your code.<p>Email me at robert (at) homerlogistics.com if you&#x27;re interested in learning more!","time":1464795201,"type":"comment"}
