We currently focus on building tools for working with new, portable DNA sequencing devices that can be used by anyone, anywhere in the world. We are committed to open access and share all of our code on github (example: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jts&#x2F;nanopolish\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jts&#x2F;nanopolish</a>).<p>This position doesn&#x27;t require prior experience in biology&#x2F;bioinformatics - the problems we solve are analogous to classic machine learning tasks like speech recognition. This would be a great position for someone who wants to try out the academic side of the world and apply their background in computation to important problems with direct relevance to biology and health.<p>See the job description for more details (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recruitingsite.com&#x2F;csbsites&#x2F;oicr&#x2F;JobDescription.asp?JobNumber=780562\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recruitingsite.com&#x2F;csbsites&#x2F;oicr&#x2F;JobDescription....</a>) or drop me a line at jared [dot] simpson [at] oicr.on.ca.","time":1464799053,"type":"comment"}
