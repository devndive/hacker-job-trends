We&#x27;ve grown amazingly fast, launching sites in over 15 countries since 2013.<p>Fast growth means technical debt, and now it&#x27;s time for us to consolidate everything into a single database platform.  Do you want to work on the bleeding edge?  We&#x27;re designing and deploying an internal BaaS platform based on PostgreSQL (already beta-testing 9.6) with a REST API powered by Python.  Our global footprint demands a distributed system, so we&#x27;re also using Hashicorp&#x27;s consul and Riak&#x27;s S2.<p>We&#x27;re currently looking to fill the following two positions:<p>1. Backend Developer (Python and SQL)<p>2. PostgreSQL Database Administrator (bonus points if you know how to develop C language extensions!)<p>You can e-mail me directly (andrew.tipton [at] compareglobalgroup [dot] com) if you&#x27;re interested in one of these positions.  If you&#x27;re not already in Hong Kong, we can sponsor you for a work visa here.  (So far we have had a 100% success rate!)","time":1464844340,"type":"comment"}
