You should be experienced and comfortable with the many available AI methods of today (deep learning, statistical methods, probabilistic methods). You can also ship production-level code and have worked with at least one of the popular AI frameworks (Tensorflow, Theano, Caffe, etc).

The ideal candidate has most or all of the following: Strong C++ skills, some Javascript experience, experience building apps with Qt (any platform), experience building an IDE, interactive debugger, or other developer tools, and a passion for designing and building great user interfaces and experiences.<p>Interested in either of these positions, or perhaps are just enthusiastic about AI and want to be involved somehow?
