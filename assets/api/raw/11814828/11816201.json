You like to know how things work under the hood but uncertainty does not stop you either. Failing is not an option, you just have to try again smarter AND harder.<p>You have a very strong background in application security; you know what OWASP Top 10 is inside out, and tinkered before with several online capture-the-flags.<p>You are very happy writing code but somehow application security, breaking software, finding vulnerabilities, and going beyond just writing code are some of the things that you just can’t take off your mind.<p>Hacking news and stolen data makes you upset. You are curious, analytical, smart, ambitious and crafty with unlimited desire to learn and grow.<p>If the above describes you, then this is your chance.<p>This entry level application security opportunity will let you continue writing code as well as do application security work such as security code reviews, web and mobile application penetration testing (extensive training will be provided).<p>If you are interested; please send your resume to jobs@softwaresecured.com and a cover letter that explains why you think you are the perfect fit for this job.","time":1464801401,"type":"comment"}
