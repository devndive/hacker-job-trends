If you’ve ever gotten an anger-inducing email from an airline with prices that are a blatant lie: we fix that.<p>We’re a close-knit team and have a variety of challenging work on our plates. A typical day can consist of everything from optimizing the Fare Prediction System in the morning to putting the finishing touches on a CSS animation in the afternoon. Our work spans multiple technologies, cultures, and languages (both programming and spoken!), so we value high quality communication and a continuous process of learning from each other.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone with at least a few years of professional software development experience that wants to work with us. Our product is built on Django&#x2F;Python&#x2F;Postgres&#x2F;Redis&#x2F;TypeScript and various other technologies used as needed. You&#x27;ll be a core member of our team - able to develop the role and technology in a direction that you find exciting as we grow the company.<p>If this sounds interesting, we would love to hear from you. Please include whatever info you believe is relevant: resume, GitHub profile, code samples, links to personal projects, etc.\nYou can apply by emailing directly (jobs@volantio.com)","time":1464798803,"type":"comment"}
