So we move fast, but we can&#x27;t be cavalier about breaking things.<p>* We also get to experiment and build cool things: We&#x27;ve used Twilio to craft a useful and constantly-improving IVR for customer service, and we help make our customers and operations folks happy by processing inquiries via SMS.\n <p>We&#x27;ll probably get along wonderfully if:<p>* You&#x27;ve got a minimum of 10 months of software engineering experience, preferably with Ruby on Rails <p>* You’re a nice person who has worked on hairy, wacky full-stack code in production<p>* You enjoy exploring implementation options and collaborating with product folks<p>* You can improve the codebase without being rude, judgmental or arrogant about it<p>* You would describe yourself less as more of a &#x27;session musician&#x27; (e.g. Carol Kaye) than a &#x27;rockstar&#x27;<p>* You&#x27;re looking for a full-time, on site role in San Francisco\n <p>Our engineering team is striving for true inclusion, since we know what it&#x27;s like to be underrepresented in tech. Our engineers didn&#x27;t go to &#x27;top CS schools&#x27; and have fought to get into this industry, so we question all tech industry platitudes.
