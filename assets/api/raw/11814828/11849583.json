We are currently hiring Junior Java Developer to expand our small team of four programmers.<p>Tech we use:<p><i>IDEA Ultimate (as an IDE, Eclipse fanboys need not apply)<p></i>Java 8 (Server side) and Java 7 (Client side)<p><i>Gradle (for deployments and compilation because screw maven and its long ass xmls)<p></i>Git (to check in code (did I really have to say that?))<p><i>Attlasian (for bug tracking)<p></i>MySQL + Hibernate (for database storage thinking of eventually moving out of that into something cooler).*<p>That is pretty much it. Work is extremely fun, and you will get to do A LOT of things (it is not all about boring finance math calculations (that part has already been done)). This is not a sweatshop and there is no corporate bullshit because the company&#x27;s awesome CTO will shield you from all of that.\nYou get to choose what OS and computer you want to work on (mine is top of the line XPS 13 for example).<p>Only things asked from you is to really love programming and be organized responsible human being, but we will not force you to work more than forty hour weeks since we are super anti burnout and want everyone in the team to be well rested and happy.<p>Submit your resume to\ndtumanov at shorcan.com\nBonus points if you give link to your github, stackoverflow account or overall show off your programming prowess.<p>Oh and did I mention that we love vim? :D","time":1465241372,"type":"comment"}
