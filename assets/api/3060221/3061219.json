I'm designing a product around OpenStack technology that will bring cloud storage to the average business.  I'm looking for one or two developers with strong experience building back-end services to join me as co-founders for this venture.  During the TechStars application process, this position is unpaid.  We're working on this project in the evenings, after our full-time jobs.  It's a gamble, I know.  On the other hand, I think that we have a strong idea and if you join me now, we will be dividing our ownership of this venture equally amongst the three or four of us.<p>For now, this product is being worked on remotely.  If selected for TechStars Cloud, we may continue to work remotely or we may converge in San Antonio, TX for the TechStars incubation stage.  Obviously, you must be able to work legally in the US.  No H1B sponsorship available.<p>About me: I have 18 years of experience as an engineer in the Internet industry.  I've spent the last four years working with cloud computing for a major hosting provider.  This idea is the genesis of daily conversations that I have with customers.  It's a product that I think business is screaming for but nobody has perfected yet--and I think I know how to perfect it.<p>If you think you have the chops to take on a project like this, send me your resume and some links to projects that you've worked on, preferably on GitHub or the like so that I can review your contributions.<p>kumogumo@gmail.com","time":1317505885,"type":"comment"}
