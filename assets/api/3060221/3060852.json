We bring transparency to auto pricing and so far we are getting a solid piece of a huge market.<p>We're looking for Python/Django developers, front end developers, Java and Ruby talent, Linux engineers, and an \"EDW SQL DB Developer,\" whatever that is.

I'm working with a great team that knows how to develop software and for management who seems to \"get it\" with regards to software developers.<p>The Python team in an open workspace that has a view of the ocean (<a href=\"http://picplz.com/user/dabent/pic/tpc4v/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://picplz.com/user/dabent/pic/tpc4v/</a>), and all the Santa Monica offices are blocks from the beach.  They have great benefits, including company equity, 100% paid family medical, dental, vision, and a healthy 401k.  They also offer gym membership reimbursement ($50 a month), 12 holidays, career training, 3 weeks PTO and have a kitchen stocked with fruit, snacks and such.  I've honestly never had a job this good.  We're also making money and recently got some really solid investment (<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/07/car-price-comparison-company-truecar-raises-200m-gears-up-for-ipo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/07/car-price-comparison-compan...</a>).<p>If you're interested, send me your resume.
