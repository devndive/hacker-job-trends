We're currently looking for software engineers to work on Green Driver (a smartphone app that uses real-time data from traffic signals to help drivers find the fastest route (<a href=\"http://imagreendriver.com)\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://imagreendriver.com)</a>) and ACFP, the flight planning system used by the US Air Force for routing non-combat flights.

We used to be a research lab at the University of Oregon, and the atmosphere maintains some of the academic feel.<p>See <a href=\"http://www.otsys.com/employment.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.otsys.com/employment.php</a> for more details.
