We sell affordable frames ($89, frames+lenses). Our bigger business, however, is designing eyewear for fashion brands. We have a number of exciting brands in the pipeline and are growing our team. If you are interested in fashion - and using technology to innovate in that space - then send me a note!<p>Our team is small, so we wear many hats. Our site is in Python+Flask, with some PHP.\nOn the backend, we've written tools to manage customers' eyewear prescriptions, manage orders and inventory with our lens laboratory, and give our employees great tools for taking care of customers.<p>We're also looking for UX developers and designers who can understand a brand's aesthetic and create an eyewear website based around that. This will entail everything from a responsive website to, for graphic designers, print collateral that goes in the packages we ship to customers.<p>I am the first engineering hire, so you'd be an early employee on the team. We want folks who can help out on backend infrastructure tasks and help us grow as we take on new brands.<p>If this sounds interesting, email me! jay[[at]]classicspecs.com","time":1370102262,"type":"comment"}
