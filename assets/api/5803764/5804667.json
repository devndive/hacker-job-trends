Our stack is mostly Rails, with a few services written in Node on the backend.  Ideal candidate also has some Scala experience as we're starting to look into that direction to replace some of the Node components we have.<p>Our frontend is being rebuilt using Backbone.js and Marionette.js.  Ideally, we'd love someone with experience using these tools (or similar) who also has some familiarity on the backend.  You should be just as happy writing code as code reviewing and mentoring other developers.<p>You can email me directly at ctide at getchute dot com for more info on these roles.","time":1370104607,"type":"comment"}
