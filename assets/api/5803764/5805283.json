We're completely swamped with work. We're looking for impressively-focused full-stack engineers and designers to help take on contracts. You <i>will</i> earn more than a typical, tenured position at other companies. You'll also get hands-on experience with a ton of open source technologies -- our stack varies depending on the project.<p>That said, we currently prefer folks who grok one or more of the following:<p>- Rails<p>- Node &#38; Express<p>- Backbone<p>- RequireJS<p>- Single-Page Web App architecture<p>- HTML5 / CSS3<p>- Postgres / MongoDB / Redis<p>- TDD<p>- BBQ (hey, we have a grill)<p>Shoot us a note to jobs at elbii if interested. Please include some code, designs, or a link to your github if appropriate.<p>Have a great weekend. :-)","time":1370111954,"type":"comment"}
