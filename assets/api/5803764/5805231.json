We're designing an FPGA based circuit that runs the things we value most from our PC. We call this PC the Switch and it's going to replace the Wintel PC and MacBook Air we currently use as our primary PC. We produce music, design gadgets and also like to teach gadget design.<p>We don't like to Google our way out of our information needs. Instead, we like to practice origional engineering where we derive our own answers from first principles. In this sense we are old-fashioned. We are also stubborn in sticking to our long term goals for years on end. We're looking for a self-starter who can meaningfully contribute to our project over the long run.
