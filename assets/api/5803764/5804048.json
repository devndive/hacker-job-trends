Many people believe that it's impossible to learn the basics of web development in just ten weeks but you'd be surprised to know how much a hard-working student can achieve in those 10 weeks :)<p>We started Makers Academy to do two things: help tech companies hire technical talent and to help people switch careers (being a Ruby dev is awesome!). We are a young VC-backed startup looking to change the way developers are taught.<p>I'm looking for instructors to help people switch careers into web development. It's a full-time job that involves lots of pairing with less experienced developers. If you make someone really understand how inject() works, it counts as a day well spent :)<p>We're also looking for guest speakers. If you'd like to share your experience with our students by giving a one-off Ruby-related talk, drop me a line, I'll buy you a lunch.<p>Email me at evgeny@makersacademy.com.","time":1370096561,"type":"comment"}
