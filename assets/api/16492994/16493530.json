Quarter million users on the app now, and we&#x27;re profitable with our Pro subscription program. This year we&#x27;re building more integrations to give people more insights about themselves, launching our new places tracking feature, and adding new ways to get meaningful health improvements (weight loss, increased productivity, continuous monitoring of biometrics, etc.)<p>We&#x27;re hiring for a couple engineering roles:<p>• iOS Engineer —— working with Swift, Objective C but also some JavaScript &amp; React Native. We have a React Native app but there are many fully-native components, like our location tracking system, the HealthKit syncing logic, and many new features we want to add this year, like an Apple Watch app and tracking for time spent on the phone.<p>• Backend Engineer —— experienced with Go, Python, Postgres, AWS, and working with huge amounts of data. Build new integrations, manage our infrastructure, and use machine learning to help all our users become more healthy. We&#x27;ve got over 50 servers processing millions of new data points every hour, which have the potential for significant health impact if analyzed correctly.<p>We are a distributed team with team members in San Francisco, New York, Canada, and even Poland. We raised a seed round last year from top investors like True Ventures and Matrix Partners, and will be growing rapidly this year so now is the perfect time to join.
