Our goal is to develop brain-machine interfaces so useful and so safe that ordinary people will choose to get them like they get a smartphone. Neuralink&#x27;s aim is to bring humans and machines closer so software forms a true extension of ourselves, rather than something separate we interact with slowly and awkwardly.<p>We are hiring for a fairly diverse set of technical backgrounds. There is a ton of software to write ranging from firmware to surgical robotics control to embedded neural data processing to a data management systems. Experience with C++ for hardware control is especially desirable. Culturally, we place a premium on diligence, care and thoroughness rather than trying out every latest cool framework.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;neuralink&#x2F;b02d4f67-53e2-43f0-bb80-ae2d2048ab35\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;neuralink&#x2F;b02d4f67-53e2-43f0-bb80-ae2d...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;neuralink&#x2F;6b01dc79-1e6b-4598-b9f4-5359e72fc0e0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;neuralink&#x2F;6b01dc79-1e6b-4598-b9f4-5359...</a>","time":1519931979,"type":"comment"}
