The phrase that most aptly describes us is “boutique consulting firm” as we are currently working on select software consulting projects and have a long term vision to build a stand-alone product in about 6 months. The future product will focus on enabling business workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future. We&#x27;re looking to get one final person in place to help us build our product, and that is hopefully you.<p>We are incredibly selective (who isn&#x27;t?) and we are really quite small. We&#x27;ve blogged about our hiring process and we&#x27;ve blogged about our funnel. The reality is we&#x27;ve optimized our hiring process to filter first, before a call. We&#x27;re sorry this is the case; it would be really nice to meet everyone, but we simply don&#x27;t have the time to do that while also working on our business. We try to be as transparent as we can be about our process, but if it doesn&#x27;t work for you we&#x27;d love to hear from you when we&#x27;re bigger and having a recruiting division who will be able to do a call first approach. We have a vision of a product but we don&#x27;t have one yet, so we can&#x27;t point you to it. Sorry!<p>Also, we&#x27;re forthright about this (see the first line of this post) but we really and truly only hire employees authorized to work in the US. We&#x27;re not large enough to want to deal with non-US tax jurisdictions, and we&#x27;re not looking for 1099 contractors at this time.<p>Who you are: An incredibly motivated, amazingly talented full stack engineer whose abilities truly shine on the front end. You know React, Webpack, CSS, Sass, JSX, and the other standard front-end technologies we don&#x27;t. You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision. You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode. You should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because you know they are doing the same for you. You love the state-of-the-art and yet understand the danger of being there and can articulate the reasons why.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.builtforme.tech\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.builtforme.tech</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.builtforme.tech\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.builtforme.tech</a><p>Apply via AngelList: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;builtforme&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;builtforme&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a>","time":1519927882,"type":"comment"}
