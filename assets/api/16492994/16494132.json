We are looking for a Software Engineer who can help us further develop this platform, making it the best possible toolchain for running marketing campaigns and launching new websites. You’ll collaborate with and learn from experienced engineers while making contributions that directly impact the success and profitability of teams and companies that we’re building.<p>When it comes to bits and bytes, our guiding philosophy is that using the right tool for a job is more important than rigid adherence to any particular programming language or tech stack. From humble origins in Python (we still use Python to write quick prototypes and one-off scripts), the majority of our core systems have evolved into highly concurrent Golang services. We also use some embedded Lua and dabble with low level network protocols. RabbitMQ, Redis, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Amazon Redshift are some of our favorite data wrangling tools; Munin, Nagios, and Icinga keep us alerted when something&#x27;s going awry.<p>Feel free to email me if you have any questions or apply through <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cogolabs.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cogolabs.com&#x2F;careers</a><p>Tyler F, tfinethy@cogolabs.com","time":1519925564,"type":"comment"}
