It seemed silly to us that even though so many companies are struggling to hire people, it still requires O(n) effort to apply to n companies.<p>So, we built workatastartup.com. It&#x27;s a simple way to apply to all YC companies at the same time. It&#x27;s only for software engineers &amp; data scientists for now (we hope to open it more broadly later). If a company is interested, you&#x27;ll get an email from them.<p>It seems to be working pretty well - many of the people who posted a profile have gotten more than a dozen company founders reaching out to them, and some people have gotten jobs through it already. We&#x27;d love if you filled out a profile and let us know what you think (workatastartup@ycombinator.com) : <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workatastartup.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workatastartup.com</a>","time":1519923187,"type":"comment"}
