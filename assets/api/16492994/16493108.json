Our software turns car dealers into modern shopping sites with up-front pricing and an end-to-end purchase &amp; checkout process ending in home delivery of your new or used car. For the in-person shopper we power the dealer&#x27;s iPads or kiosks to provide the same fluid process in the store, without the usual negotiation or hassle.<p>Check us out at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;roadster.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;roadster.com</a> and our 5-star reviews at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;yelp.com&#x2F;biz&#x2F;roadster-san-francisco\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;yelp.com&#x2F;biz&#x2F;roadster-san-francisco</a><p>We&#x27;re hiring a frontend and backend engineer to help expand our customer base nationwide (and internationally), and to own, build, and launch snazzy new features. Our web apps target both dealer and consumer end users, so we emphasize great design and technology to scale to thousands of dealers. We use Ruby on Rails, Vue.js (migrating from Angular), Elasticsearch, Postgres &amp; Redis. You should have a CS degree or equivalent and 2 years of work experience. Our team is small so you&#x27;ll be owning your projects right away. Our PA office is a converted body shop with a rollup garage door.<p>Email me at dino@roadster.com for more details!","time":1519920534,"type":"comment"}
