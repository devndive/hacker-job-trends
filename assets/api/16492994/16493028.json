This is a one-month role with the potential to extend depending on sales growth and additional fundraising.<p>Our company provides hotel linen and housekeeping services to premium apartment buildings in Chicago. We own all the bed linens and towels and change them out from subscribers’ apartments every week, just like housekeepers at a hotel. We sell the service as a free amenity to buildings, and then we sign up individual tenants for a weekly recurring subscription. They can also sign up for housecleaning. We&#x27;re looking to land our first few buildings, and that’s where you come in.<p>The job is a combination of inside and outside sales (prospecting, calling, and going on meetings with property and asset managers) with an hourly base rate and a bonus for every building you sign up.<p>We’ll provide prospecting support, promotional materials, and everything you need to be successful. You&#x27;ll be selling alongside the co-founders and we&#x27;ll pay for your desk at the River North Level Office location. The job starts immediately.<p>Email us with questions or your resume!
