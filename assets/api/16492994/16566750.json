If you see a foreign key as a mathematical domain and think in terms of relation values and variables, we are probably on the same page.\n- Knowing your way around PostgreSQL, or failing that any large scale RDBMS deployment; there are infrastructure teams and DBAs but they need your guidance.\n- At least some enjoyment of the resolution of large, complex problems using more abstract methods as opposed to quick hacks and duct tape.\n- UNIX&#x2F;Linux, but if you&#x27;ve read that far you probably have more than enough experience. \n- Speaking Chinese (Mandarin) may help a bit but the team has multiple native speakers.<p>Interview process:\n- Email vanessa.tan@lazada.com to be sent a few quick questions. Include &quot;6h9mYszLTq2Y&quot; in the subject line so we know you&#x27;re not a bot.\n- An hour or two over Skype for probing your technical experience.\n- An hour or two in Singapore (if you are there) or over Skype for the C-levels to figure out if they can work with you.","time":1520841816,"type":"comment"}
