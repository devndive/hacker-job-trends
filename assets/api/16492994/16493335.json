If you believe that released beats perfect and that simple beats easy, you are the best candidate for us.<p>You will be part of the core product development team, a group of 7~8 people who create the product piece by piece, have a say in technical choices and build features from the ground up. You will participate in the Scrum process activities, from refining stories, to scoring them, to pair-program them until they&#x27;re successfully tested and released. All of that while immersed in one of the most vibrant startup communities in the heart of Amsterdam.<p>For more information get in touch with carlo.sciolla@synple.eu","time":1519921686,"type":"comment"}
