We are a small software consulting shop that works primarily in the Biotech field, building web applications for bioinformatics purposes.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a developer who is well-versed in the modern front-end landscape and feels comfortable building JavaScript applications from the ground up. We&#x27;re pretty agnostic on framework but ideally someone with experience using React and Vue would be ideal. Most of what we build uses Python on the back-end so some familiarity with that would be nice, but not crucial.<p>This is a contract (1099) role and we are a fully distributed team so remote is the only option, really :)<p>We&#x27;re open to candidates all over the globe as long as you have strong communication skills in English. Time zone isn&#x27;t a huge concern.<p>If it sounds like it could be a good fit, drop me a line at jordan [at] speizersoftware {dot} com. Please make sure to include the following pieces of info:<p><pre><code>  - Brief description about yourself and your web development experience (portfolio&#x2F;github is always nice to see)\n  - Hourly&#x2F;Daily&#x2F;Weekly rate (or alternative payment structure, if you prefer)\n  - Hours per week available \n  - Location</code></pre>","time":1519938384,"type":"comment"}
