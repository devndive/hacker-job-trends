We’re a small team of HNers fresh off of our seed funding lead by Andreessen Horowitz. We’re fueled by a vision to transition synthetic biology to a fully-fledged engineering discipline. We’re building our our initial software team and need help with everything at the intersection of infrastructure, software systems, data ingestion and storage and machine learning for predicting optimal genetic circuit design. Check out some of our work at www.github.com&#x2F;CIDARLAB&#x2F;cello and our mission at www.asimov.io&#x2F;blog<p>Search Keywords: deep learning, sequence to sequence learning, bioinformatics, cloud infrastructure, python, tensorflow, microservices, biotech, Boston, Cambridge<p>Prerequisites:\n* 4+ years hands on experience as a SWE or ML engineer in industry\n* ML engineer: knowledge of modern methods in reinforcement learning, generative adversarial models, breadth of knowledge across supervised and unsupervised learning and experience applying these models in software\n* SWE: knowledge of cloud infrastructure, large scale data warehousing, build&#x2F;test&#x2F;deploy platform development\n* Excitement to learn a tremendous amount about genetics, bio hacking, genetic circuit design\n* Excitement to own your own roadmap and prioritization<p>Perks:\n* Flexible working hours, develop when you are most productive\n* We believe in creating a lifelong company by avoiding burnout and focusing on long term impact\n* Frequent team lunches, happy hours, offsites (borda borg!), snacks and a fully stocked coffee lab\n* Cross pollination: We’re an awesome team of scientists and engineers from diverse technical backgrounds.
