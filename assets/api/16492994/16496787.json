Most of our existing folks have a PL research and&#x2F;or formal methods background and enjoy demonstrating the correctness of their solutions with gusto: randomized test case generation, model checking in SPIN&#x2F;Promela or interactive theorem proving using Coq. We&#x27;re very active in the Haskell community - contributing new language extenions (linear types, static pointers) to GHC, publishing and maintaining HaskellR, inline-java, sparkle, rules_haskell and many others. We hit the HN front page just yesterday with our Haskell support in Bazel.<p>Tweag.io are organized as a distributed team of experts around three main areas of focus: distributed systems engineering, functional programming based devops (Nix, Haskell etc) and mathematical modelling &#x2F; machine learning. We are looking for formal engineers and PL designers to join our distributed systems team, to help us apply interactive theorem proving techniques to industrial scale projects and work on tools to make this cost effective for the masses.<p>If you&#x27;d love the opportunity and the space to solve the hard problems of science&#x27;s large dataset infrastructure, by systematically decomposing them into simple, orthogonal solutions that compose and commute like in algebra, shoot us an email at jobs@tweag.io.","time":1519941638,"type":"comment"}
