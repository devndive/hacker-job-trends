The current system is broken: SSN&#x27;s are used as both a username and a password, but after repeated data breaches are also effectively semi-public. Identity-verification data isn&#x27;t shared, so the same fraudsters target every company and consumers have to continually reverify themselves with different institutions. Billions of dollars are lost every year to criminals who are very rarely caught or punished. SentiLink is building the arbiter of identity to bring identity into the 21st century.<p>Our investors include former co-founders and C-level execs at PayPal, Palantir, Affirm, Visa, and Citibank, including Max Levchin (SciFi) and Hans Morris (Nyca Partners).<p>Apply here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;sentilink&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;sentilink&#x2F;jobs</a> or email me (first name at sentilink.com).","time":1519928159,"type":"comment"}
