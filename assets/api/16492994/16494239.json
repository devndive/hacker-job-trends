We don&#x27;t have nap rooms or catered lunches, but it&#x27;s a great place to work, benefits are solid, the people are nice, and the project will have some unique and interesting challenges (some good, some bad).<p>The role isn&#x27;t on my team directly, but I personally think this is a cool opportunity for a more junior person looking to break into web design and development. I also love that we&#x27;re opening some positions to more junior people (taking to heart an article from a few weeks back about The Death of Junior Positions)<p>If any of you know someone with a good creative eye (if not a ton of experience), or someone who loves the idea of designing for media, feel free to pass on the link!\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;atlanticmedia.theresumator.com&#x2F;apply&#x2F;RWKxWJB7b9\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;atlanticmedia.theresumator.com&#x2F;apply&#x2F;RWKxWJB7b9</a>","time":1519926207,"type":"comment"}
