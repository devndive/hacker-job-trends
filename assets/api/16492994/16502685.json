We are bringing financial empowerment, job opportunities, and more to those who in general are underserved by their industries, and we&#x27;ve already made big strides with executing on these ideas.<p>We&#x27;re a pretty small team but are growing very quickly and looking for experienced developers to help build out the foundations of our dev team, so think lots of autonomy and leadership opportunity. Our stack is React &#x2F; Rails back-end, but specific experience with those are not strictly necessary. Even though it&#x27;s a startup, we&#x27;re very well funded and are offering competitive salaries.<p>Feel free to reach out to me directly at dan@nowsta.com with any interest or questions!","time":1520007028,"type":"comment"}
