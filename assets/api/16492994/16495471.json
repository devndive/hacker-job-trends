We build tools for developers to add beautiful and functional maps and location-based services to their websites and applications. We’re obsessed with individual growth and learning, building teams with diverse perspectives, and showing empathy for our teammates and customers.<p>We’re a fairly distributed team, with large offices in Washington, DC and San Francisco, CA, and satellite offices in Berlin, Helsinki, Bangalore, and Shanghai. There are limited opportunities for remote work on a team-by-team basis. As a result, we prioritize self-directedness and strong written communication skills.<p>Aside from our mobile SDKs, our codebase is largely nodeJS and React, although we write C++ where performance truly matters, as well as some Python for data wrangling and machine learning. We don’t mind if you haven’t worked with our stack before as long as you’re excited to learn!<p>Apply at: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mapbox.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mapbox.com&#x2F;careers</a>","time":1519933588,"type":"comment"}
