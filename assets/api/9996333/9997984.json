We are the next step in wearable technology --- instead of tracking what you do, we change what you do. Pavlok uses classical conditioning (pairing a bad habit with a slightly uncomfortable electrical stimulus) to break bad habits in a week or less -- more than 50% of our users quit smoking by day 5.<p>Pavlok also has an open API that allows developers to use the wearable to vibrate, beep, and zap (with different voltage levels and patterns) on command.<p>We&#x27;ve been featured on Good Morning America, the Colbert Report, The New York Times, Boston Globe, and hundreds of other news sources. We are a part of Amazon&#x27;s new Launchpad program, see here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitly.com&#x2F;1g1fVds\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitly.com&#x2F;1g1fVds</a><p>Embedded Engineer<p>We are doing bluetooth coding with two chips: The Bluegiga 113 (BGScript language) and A Nordic chipset (C language). We are looking for embedded programmers with a background in Bluetooth LE coding. Ideally, you&#x27;ve had experience with APNS and ANCS (Apple&#x27;s push&#x2F;notification services).<p>UI&#x2F;UX Designer<p>We are looking for a UI&#x2F;UX designer to take our app to the next level. We have both web designs, app design, assets, and infographic needs.
