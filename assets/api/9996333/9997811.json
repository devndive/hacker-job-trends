Sort of like a uber but for buses.  Efficient mass-transit is a huge engineering problem and one ripe for disruption. We believe the end game will certainly involve an api driven bus fleet.  The challenge is absolutely massive and we&#x27;re very excited to be working in it! Our current stack is Node.js &#x2F; Rails &#x2F; Angular.js &#x2F; React.js &#x2F; Postgres &#x2F; AWS &#x2F; Cordova.  Furthermore, we&#x27;re also looking for mobile developers with previous experience in shipping Android and iOS apps.  We are keen to experiment with React native and rubymotion.<p>We offer a competitive salary, a good team to work with and a good office in Andheri West with lots of amenities.  We just closed our first round of funding.<p>If any of this interests you, email me at anshul AT rbus.in","time":1438621729,"type":"comment"}
