Our backend is almost fully powered by Node. The position requires someone who can adapt and thrive under pressure. Some of the backend is being moved to micro-services but we&#x27;re not planning to go overboard with it. You&#x27;ll be the third engineer (joining me and another person) and employee #15 so you&#x27;ll have a huge impact on not only the tech but the company itself. We&#x27;re passionate about making our customers happy and know that our tech plays a big part of that process. Come join us!<p>Most of the work requires backend knowledge:<p>* JavaScript (we&#x27;re slowly moving the codebase over to ES6), Node&#x2F;io\n* Postgres, Redis\n* API development\n* nginx&#x2F;AWS&#x2F;DevOps (some base knowledge, at the very least)\n* Would be awesome if you know front-end dev (Backbone, React, moving to Flux-like arch soon). Not necessary though so don&#x27;t fret.<p>Please email me at chetan@urbanstems.com. I definitely value seeing your past work over a standard resume but feel free to send it along.","time":1438618786,"type":"comment"}
