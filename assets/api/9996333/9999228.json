It can be a shock compared to what you may be used to.<p>This is ONSITE. We hire at all levels, including INTERNS.\nWe can only hire US citizens due to government requirements. Our background check includes a polygraph.<p>We do lots of reverse engineering, vulnerability research, custom in-house emulation (with JIT and&#x2F;or hypervisor), constraint solvers, and static analysis of both source and binary code. We work with numerous OSes and processor types. You could write the tools (emulator, JIT, hypervisor, debugger, static analysis, etc.) or you could make use of them to find vulnerabilities. An understanding of compilers is often helpful.<p>You can run Linux. We don&#x27;t expect overtime, but we&#x27;ll pay you for it if you want to do it. Most locations have extreme flex-time and offices with solid walls.<p>If you happen to be at DEF-CON 23 in Las Vegas (August 6-9) you can catch us there.<p>Extra keywords: assembly assembler IDA Pro MIPS x86 x64 ppc PowerPC ARM ROP security VMX decompiler kernel driver embedded C99 buffer overflow opcode ASLR NX SMEP SMAP MPX\n8051 MSP430 AVR32 MCU TOP SECRET TS&#x2F;SCI SSBI classified clearance cleared formal verification sandbox fuzzer fuzzing crashes<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;advancedsecuritylabs.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;advancedsecuritylabs.com&#x2F;</a>","time":1438630890,"type":"comment"}
