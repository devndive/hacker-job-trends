I&#x27;m the one responsible for everything on iOS that isn&#x27;t a game.<p>We ship improvements to the app and a new game every month. You would take your own tasks and help with code review for each release.<p>Objective C and some C++ experience is necessary, we also use Swift in some isolated places, and would like to use Swift wherever feasible.<p>The app is very animation heavy. CoreAnimation experience is useful. Understanding what causes performance issues and how to use Xcode&#x27;s profiling tools is useful too. We have really talented designers who cry when you build ugly things.<p>It&#x27;s a pretty chill gig. We probably need at least half of your time around a deadline, but usually you can spend as much time as you want working on stuff. The well of tasks never runs dry. We have an office, but Slack+Trello means you can work from anywhere.<p>Send at least your Github username to me: david+hn@elevateapp.com<p>Links to anything you&#x27;ve done that is on the App Store is way more interesting to me than a resume.","time":1438614335,"type":"comment"}
