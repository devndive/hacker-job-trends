Our customers range from large nonprofits to hacker events. The founding team includes two Y Combinator alumni and a CEO who&#x27;s renowned in the field. We&#x27;re looking for more developers to join our growing team.<p>We have an isomorphic React frontend (using CJSX, SASS, BrowserSync, webpack...) to a RoR API. We use CircleCI, Git Flow and Continuousish Deploymentâ„¢... All of which means we&#x27;ll get you committing to production on day one. It&#x27;s a hugely challenging but endlessly rewarding app to work on.<p>We offer great perks such as max-spec hardware, equity, retreats, on-site gym, on-site climbing wall, bike parking and a lovely office (with a terrace!) a few minutes walk from Bermondsey. Oh, and there&#x27;s a go kart track too :D<p>If that sounds great, we&#x27;d love to hear from you. You can apply via <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;timecounts.org&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;timecounts.org&#x2F;jobs</a> and if you have any questions do feel free to drop me an email at jobs@timecounts.org<p>Thanks!\nJof","time":1438619003,"type":"comment"}
