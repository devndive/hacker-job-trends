We&#x27;re Nylas and we&#x27;re looking for help building the next generation email platform. We&#x27;re building a missing piece of Internet infrastructure and are looking for frontend application engineers and designers and backend systems and infrastructure&#x2F;operations engineers to join us.<p>Companies are building their core businesses around our email API right now. We have to be reliable, up all the time, and fast. We have more data for a single user than in most startups&#x27; entire database. We&#x27;re scaling heavily and if you have experience with automated deployments, debugging running systems, release engineering, and on-call schedules, but are still comfortable writing code, this job might be for you. :)<p>Many people spend their entire days buried in mail clients which haven&#x27;t significantly changed in years. Yet have you ever met anyone who really loves their email experience? We want to change that. We&#x27;re building a frontend framework to power the next generation of mail apps. Sound exciting to you?<p>== We&#x27;re particularly looking for folks who ==<p>* Take personal pride in their work and value autonomy and ownership<p>* Want the chance to step up and lead a team<p>* Put the work before ego. We&#x27;ve got each others&#x27; backs, and we want you to be with us on that<p>== A bit more about us ==<p>* Our backend is built on Python, Flask, gevent, nginx, MySQL, AWS, and Debian. We&#x27;ve been careful to keep our architecture componentized<p>* Our frontend projects use Coffeescript, React, Flux, SQL for offline caching, Electron (Atom Shell), and no jQuery<p>* Tons of our code is open source. Check it out: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nylas\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nylas</a><p>* We&#x27;re 40% women on our team of 13 (12 engineers), including 1 of 2 cofounders. We want to make that number 50%<p>* We have a paid vacation policy &amp; value personal responsibility and ownership. Benefits include full health, dental, vision, commuter, &amp; lunch at the office every day. Some remote work &#x2F; work-from-home is OK too<p>Apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nylas.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nylas.com&#x2F;jobs</a> or ping me directly (evan at nylas dot com). I&#x27;m one of the frontend engineers. We&#x27;re a diverse team, and encourage applications from all backgrounds","time":1438620640,"type":"comment"}
