Stack-wise, we use Python&#x2F;Django, Backbone, Postrges and MongoDB and have native iOS and Android apps.<p>We believe in T-shaped generalists so if you&#x27;re a Python engineer that&#x27;d like to learn what mobile development is all about, or the other way around, we&#x27;d love to hear from you.<p>More details at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;c7qald\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;c7qald</a>","time":1438618311,"type":"comment"}
