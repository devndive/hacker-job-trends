{"by":"zyxwilkins","id":10056622,"parent":9996333,"text":"For the Fall Semester:<p>Consensus Systems LLC (ConsenSys) (consensys.net) is a blockchain production studio building decentralized applications, mostly on Ethereum. We are currently building foundational tools for emerging business models in the cryptocurrency or Bitcoin 2.0 space. These tools will be packaged into separate ventures that are individually funded and skinned for different business niches.\nWe are hiring 5-15 students for our Fall&#x2F;Winter 2015 internship program. The primary focus will be to build decentralized applications.  You will have access to our team with a variety of backgrounds, and you will have opportunities to observe and plug into our other ongoing projects. Preferably, you will work with us at our office in NYC. If there is interest we may coordinate housing in a shared space with other interested interns. The internship period is roughly early September - late December, but dates are negotiable.  Since ConsenSys is itself a somewhat decentralized company, with personnel in various cities, remote working interns may be considered.  Please apply by sending an email to opportunities@consensys.net with github, work samples, resume, and general interests in the space. If you include a proposal for a dApp, smart contract, or other useful tool you want to build, we may consider the development of that project. If the internship is successful, there is opportunity to continue the project beyond the Fall internship period with additional support.\nThis is a paid internship.","time":1439494102,"type":"comment"}
