Or how about whether or not those new flavors of Red Bull actually get more people to buy Red Bull versus just giving existing Red Bull drinkers more flavors to choose from? Wish you knew why people pay more for Calvin Klein shirts than Ralph Lauren? And has Best Buy really turned into Amazon&#x27;s showroom?<p>You&#x27;re not alone. Those brands &amp; retailers wonder about those questions and thousands more that InfoScout is uniquely positioned to answer. Thanks to more than 1-million users of our Receipt Hog, Shoparoo, ReceiptBin and Out of Milk apps, InfoScout captures more information about American&#x27;s shopping patterns across all retailers than any other company.

Our use of computer vision, crowdsourcing &amp; big data analytics allow us to extract insights at a scale and depth never before possible for clients like Procter &amp; Gamble, Anheuser Busch, Walmart &amp; Visa.","time":1438637488,"type":"comment"}
