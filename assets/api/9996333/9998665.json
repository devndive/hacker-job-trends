If you’re the kind of programmer we’re looking for your exact background doesn’t matter as much as your ability to learn quickly and your sheer problem solving stamina.<p>You can expect to work in a small dedicated team with a chat channel for questions, and with feedback in the form of code review. The project is a Python and bottle based solution, although Django experience is appreciated because we all secretly wish it were Django. The front-end is a ton of Javascript on backbone.js. You may or may not work on the lower hardware level stuff but if you do that&#x27;d be C++, Qt and more Python.<p>You like:<p><pre><code>    * Python.\n    * Unit tests, integration tests, browser tests, test tests, every test.\n    * Cool digital signs.\n    * Great UIs with a good user experience.\n    * Docker, Raspberry Pi, Continous Integration, Code Review, Open Source components.\n</code></pre>\nApply here[1], and feel free to contact me at @vpetersson.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.upwork.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;Python-Software-Developer_~~9fd530a16785957c\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.upwork.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;Python-Software-Developer_~~9fd5...</a>","time":1438626917,"type":"comment"}
