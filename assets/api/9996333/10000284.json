Walmart&#x27;s mobile apps are highly rated and the services we write to support them are the base of that success. We started from a small company acquisition with a single product. Today, we power a platform and a suite of products running on mobile devices and systems in retail stores.<p>We&#x27;re still a small, flat team of engineers. We work with our own tools and make our own build-or-borrow decisions. Our culture is a healthy mix of sharing and pushing each other to be better at our craft. For example, we use pull requests &amp; code reviews liberally. We make refactoring time. We deploy often, with a single line of code run from a REPL. Engineers on our team are challenged to work through our full software stack and be part of our product management. We believe that people are more engaged, fulfilled and happy when they feel responsible for actually shipping their work.<p>The environment at WalmartLabs balances moving fast and breaking shit, with the knowledge that we could break shit for 150+ million people every week. It&#x27;s a tough balance but we&#x27;ve found the payoff to be worth the challenge and responsibility.<p>Some aspects of our work that are important to us:<p><pre><code>  - high performance distributed systems\n  - robust &amp; well-factored codebases\n  - simple &amp; fast deployments\n  - automating the hell out of operations\n  - thorough system test coverage\n  - managing our own development process and work backlog\n  - pair programming when it makes sense (locally and remotely)\n  - contributing back to the clojure &amp; open source community\n</code></pre>\nWhat we do:<p><pre><code>  - write all our production systems &amp; tools in Clojure\n  - create and orchestrate massive distributed systems\n  - spin up RESTful web services for consuming &amp; ingesting large volumes of data\n</code></pre>\nFor a glimpse behind the scenes, check out a talk I gave at Clojure&#x2F;West. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=av9Xi6CNqq4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=av9Xi6CNqq4</a>.<p>Does this sound like something you&#x27;re into?
