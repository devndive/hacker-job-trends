Our vision is to own the consumer experience for discovering products and deciding which one to purchase. We’re currently a small team of three: two experienced developers and a “non-technical” founder whose last job was building satellites for NASA. Our tech Backbone-based front-end, with improvements to allow it to run on both client- and server- side, and as both a single- and multi- page app. RESTful backend written in functional Coffeescript on Node.js, with a temporal postgres database that allows for rewinding to a previous state. The codebase is written in Coffeescript, Jade, and Stylus. Entertaining git history. Gratuitous use of Monads.<p>We&#x27;re a multidisciplinary team, so we&#x27;d love to hear from full-stack&#x2F;frontend&#x2F;backend engineers as well as designers familiar with html&#x2F;css. We&#x27;re optimizing more for hiring someone talented, rather than for a specific role. If you’re interested in learning more, email me at stuart@slant.co","time":1438626380,"type":"comment"}
