I have only positive things to say about working here. The people are intelligent and helpful, a lot of interesting problems to solve and the work hours are unbelievably sane. The company is strongly data driven and very dynamic, which was one of its biggest charms for me. Amsterdam is not a bad place to be either :) The work environment is very international and everybody speaks fluent English. The relocation process is also very finely tuned.They take care of you from the moment you get an offer to the point you have set up your house in Amsterdam.<p>If you have any other questions about the company or the hiring process or you would like me to refer you, please feel free to send me an email at siddharthsarda01 at gmail.com (Email also in my profile at Hacker news). A lot of people have reached out to me via these threads and are in the middle of the interview process.<p>To have an idea of the kind of problems being solved here, you can also look at our dev blog: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.booking.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.booking.com&#x2F;</a><p>We are hiring for our headquarters office in Amsterdam:<p>- Frontend developers - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;cxmso8\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;cxmso8</a><p>- Perl developers - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;g5n6oe\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;g5n6oe</a><p>- Data scientists - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;n4o02e\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;n4o02e</a><p>For all available positions take a look here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;3ryvfg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;3ryvfg</a>","time":1438614134,"type":"comment"}
