As a result, we offer the best of both words: a start-up mentality with the backing of an established global company.\nWe are a curious, creative team of people who love to solve big, challenging problems. We foster a culture of learning and thrive on continuous improvement through teamwork to build better products and a better company.\nWe are growing rapidly and hiring world-class software engineers, data scientists, data analysts, sales directors.<p>Website: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.slice.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.slice.com</a><p>Company video: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=oY8OKR85KMk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=oY8OKR85KMk</a><p>Please send resumes&#x2F;portfolios to sean+resumes [AT] slice.com and mention the HN Who&#x27;s Hiring thread when applying!
