Product Pains is an early-stage community dedicated to improving products. I’m the only one working on it full time.<p>I’m looking for a designer to help me create some beautiful, engaging blog posts. The blog is targeted at designers and others who really care about building and using high quality product experiences in order to build an audience for Product Pains. I’ve got a lot of content outlined but need help fleshing it out, creating visuals, and making it beautiful.<p>I’m open to interns, contract work, remote work, or bringing someone on to the team full time. I care more about you being the right fit. I love all talent, including the young and eager.<p>Email me at: andrew@productpains.com.","time":1438650113,"type":"comment"}
