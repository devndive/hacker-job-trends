Join us, and you&#x27;ll gain deep experience developing systems at scale and working with a world-class data science team (winners of multiple KDD Best Paper and other awards). We&#x27;re still pretty small on the engineering team, and everyone gets their hands dirty and makes a real impact.<p>We&#x27;re mostly a Java shop. Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Cassandra, and Kafka are big parts of our stack, and we&#x27;re always looking for new tech that helps us work at scale. Experience with these is a big plus, but if you&#x27;ve never used them before that&#x27;s fine too. If you write clean, tested, working code, think through problems, and know how to ship, we want to talk to you.<p>We&#x27;re a Crain&#x27;s Best Place to Work in NYC for the 3rd year in a row. We play Ultimate or Soccer on Fridays, have a company band, game nights, and dev seminars where we talk tech and learn from each other. We keep sane hours and don&#x27;t track vacation. And we&#x27;ve recently started using a work-sample in our hiring process, so no coding at a whiteboard with someone over your shoulder or other high-stress interview awfulness.<p>Contact me for more info, jason@dstillery.com, or apply:<p>Senior Software Engineer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;dstillery&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;36447\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;dstillery&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;36447</a><p>Software Engineer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;dstillery&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;11316\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;dstillery&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;11316</a><p>All roles are ONSITE in NYC.","time":1439321787,"type":"comment"}
