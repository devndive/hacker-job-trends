Do you love Ruby _and_ type systems? Want to help scale one of the largest consumer-oriented serverless platforms? Join IFTTT!<p>IFTTT is the free way to get all your apps and devices talking to each other. Not everything on the internet plays nice, so we&#x27;re on a mission to build a more connected world.<p>IFTTT is hiring for a number of engineering roles* but I’m selfishly plugging the systems engineering (more-or-less backend) role. We’re a high-leverage team building resilient systems that operate at scale. Help us thoughtfully break apart our monolithic Rails application into composable services that support our consumer-facing teams to deliver award-winning experiences.<p>If you’re in the Bay Area and want to learn more, shoot me an email at nicky@ifttt.com. Happy to grab coffee and chat about what we’re working on and how you can help.<p>* Are you a data, mobile, or infrastructure engineer? We’d love to talk to you too! I’m happy to connect you with the right folks here at IFTTT.","time":1527965145,"type":"comment"}
