Have a pretty cool in house Slack bot for orchestration, that we should probs open source at some point.<p>I&#x27;m a backend dev here, and we&#x27;re finding it hard to get good people through the door. Once we chat with them, we almost always convince them to work here, but its very difficult getting people through the door. We&#x27;re paying pretty well as well for London rates, 50-80k GBP for mid-senior guys, could probs convince the CTO&#x27;s to pay more for the right candidate. The office is nice, engineering is a big part of the decision making process.<p>Feel free to send me an email either at sam.holmes<i>at</i>festicket.com or the (personal) email in my bio.
