We&#x27;re looking for a full stack web application developer to help us grow and refine AppOptics.  If you&#x27;re interested in data visualization, monitoring, or distributed systems then this could be the job for you.<p>Our stack consists of ES6, React, and Redux talking via REST and GraphQL to Rails and Sinatra apps. We develop locally in Docker containers and deploy to AWS.<p>The AppOptics team is small (~30, growing) and tightly knit.  We ship early and often so that we can iterate on user feedback, we&#x27;re always evaluating new technologies to see if they will benefit us, and we have lots of opportunities for individuals to have a big impact.<p>I consider myself lucky to work with this talented, thoughtful, and fun team. People are what make a job exceptional. Email dkuebrich@solarwinds.cloud if you have any questions or would like to join us!","time":1527871370,"type":"comment"}
