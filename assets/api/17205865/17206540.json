Since our 2015 launch, we have saved over 20 million bottles and cans from entering the ecosystem. Weâ€™re a team of technology and design enthusiasts excited to take on a stagnant industry. Bottled beverage distribution is expensive, ineffective, and environmentally wasteful - and it hasn&#x27;t changed significantly in decades. We&#x27;re entirely cutting out the traditional bottled beverage supply chain, while taking point-of-use beverage creation to a new level.<p>Senior Android developer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bevicareers.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;DE13C1D11C\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bevicareers.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;DE13C1D11C</a><p>Full-stack software developer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bevicareers.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;062BE7B89A\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bevicareers.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;062BE7B89A</a><p>We are always seeking great software developers to build future versions of our software.
