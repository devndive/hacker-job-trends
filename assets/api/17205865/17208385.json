It uses a federated ledger with central bank-backed digital cash as its settlement asset. The first implementation of the DCN architecture is the Utility Settlement Coin (USC), referenced in the BISâ€™s Money Flower taxonomy [1].<p>Properly architecting and successfully deploying this technology could better facilitate interbank cash settlement and reduce the need for posting margin and holding reserves against unsettled obligations, freeing significant amounts of capital for more productive purposes and mitigating a source of systemic risk in the banking system.<p>We are hiring theoretical cryptographers to work on hard problems involving zero knowledge and hardware enclaves, among others. You will be able to publish if you desire. The company is a 30 person startup with an academic culture, currently raising a Series A.<p>Please contact me if interested: byron dot gibson gmail.<p>[1]:<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bis.org&#x2F;publ&#x2F;qtrpdf&#x2F;r_qt1709z.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bis.org&#x2F;publ&#x2F;qtrpdf&#x2F;r_qt1709z.htm</a>","time":1527877180,"type":"comment"}
