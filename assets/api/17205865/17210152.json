Our stack is Python, Django, Javascript, React, React Native. We value good engineering practices: we write maintainable code, review each others&#x27; work, use tests and static analysis tools to help catch mistakes, and have a CI pipeline to release often.<p>If you care about making peoples&#x27; lives better through good food or if you&#x27;re interested in the challenges of delivering nutrition at scale, you&#x27;ll love it at Thistle.
