The answers to these questions exist in specific and separate public datasets, but together, they can provide a vast and powerful view of what’s happening in the world.<p>Enigma was founded in 2012 in order to centralize and normalize public data globally (think Google for public data). We believe that free and open societies can’t exist without open and timely access to public data. Data that helps the public hold governments accountable, can also be used creatively to address significant social problems. Enigma&#x27;s mission is to build the technology and solutions that will empower people to interpret and improve, the world around them.<p>We&#x27;re hiring Software Engineers, Data Engineers &amp; Data Scientists to help scale our product development efforts.<p>Check out our careers page for more info: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enigma.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;openings\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enigma.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;openings</a>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enigma.com&#x2F;engineering\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enigma.com&#x2F;engineering</a>","time":1528118338,"type":"comment"}
