Furthermore, it looks like you’re using AWS (AWS Rekognition) and Azure (Microsoft Face API) AI&#x2F;Image&#x2F;Face recognition services. Although your Privacy Policy mostly covers what you’re doing, a more prominent permission request screen and more explicit warnings about this is warranted. Your iOS app is basically just a shell really. All of its functionality is provided by cloud services. Although this is the norm nowadays, I think the burden of informing the users falls primarily on you, the developer, especially considering the main subject of your app is infants and children. All of this is further alarming since your app isn’t free so even the Facebook excuse of “it’s free!” doesn’t really apply here.","time":1527895367,"type":"comment"}
