Weâ€™re expanding our engineering team to keep up with our rapid customer and revenue growth.<p>Tenable.io is the first comprehensive cyber exposure platform. You will be joining a team that is building a streaming data pipeline using Kafka and Java&#x2F;Kotlin. We are also building connectors to 3rd party applications using a FaaS (aka serverless). This is a great opportunity to have a significant impact.<p>In terms of skills, you should be able to develop, deploy and maintain a microservice written in Java&#x2F;Kotlin or another language that runs on the JVM, that exposes a REST API, calls other REST APIs, parses and produces JSON, reads&#x2F;writes to&#x2F;from a data store (PG&#x2F;Aurora...). It&#x27;s a plus if you understand how to instrument your code (telemetry, logs, etc.), and ideally understand retries with backoffs, ideally circuit breakers, etc. If you already know Kafka that&#x27;s a plus. AWS, GCP or Azure experience is needed.<p>I&#x27;m the Sr. Director of Engineering, Data Services (Data Science and Data Engineering). You can reach me at aahmed @ tenable.com.
