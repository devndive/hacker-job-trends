Consumer facing, seriously big market opportunity.\n<a href=\"http://jobsco.re/N0ADHv\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jobsco.re/N0ADHv</a><p>The idea for Jana got its start at the MIT Media Lab. Now weâ€™ve broken out and are building a company to change the way business is done in the developing world. Jana gives away free mobile airtime in exchange for market research or advertising. To the users of prepaid phones in the developing world, this free airtime is as good as cash. Our goal is to give a 5% raise to 1 billion people by redirecting wasted research and marketing dollars.<p>Currently we are using Python, Flask, CouchDB and Redis. We host everything with Ubuntu on EC2 and other Amazon Web Services. Git makes our codebase easy to work with. Fabric makes deploying fast and consistent. We hire bright developers who can get shit done.<p>Everybody is motivated by money at some level. So we make sure to pay better than other startups and give an equity stake to make sure that the company's success is your success.<p>We do our own hiring, talk with a developer, not a recruiter: <a href=\"http://jobsco.re/N0ADHv\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jobsco.re/N0ADHv</a>","time":1341495935,"type":"comment"}
