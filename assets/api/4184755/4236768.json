There will be phenomenal opportunities for the right candidates to shape this business and their role within it. We are based at General Assembly in NYC's Flatiron District.<p>WHO WE ARE<p>Dwelleo is a communication platform for where you live. Our mission is to make it easy to connect with everyone related to your home and neighborhood. Dwelleo gives each address its own landing page where residents can access building and neighborhood discussion boards; tools to communicate directly with neighbors, groups and building management; and Q&#38;A and review forums.<p>We are at the early stages of building a web application with terrific business potential as well as broad utility and appeal. If we get it right, even your grandmother will use and love Dwelleo.<p>WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR<p>We are looking for software engineers with strong experience (or else a passion to get involved in) building consumer-facing web products and an appetite for building something from the ground floor. This includes both UX/front-end developers and full-stack developers.<p>Our current product is built using Java, Spring and Hibernate on the back-end. Knowledge of these is certainly a plus but not essential for someone who's eager to learn.<p>As far as practical arrangements, we are young and scrappy and ready to do what it takes to get the right team focused on building the right product. Ideally, we want people fulltime in NYC. But we are open to considering part-time and remote arrangements initially. Regardless, we will make sure our team is fairly compensated.<p>Please respond to: noah [at] dwelleo.com","time":1342126633,"type":"comment"}
