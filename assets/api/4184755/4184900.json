We're looking for people that have experience troubleshooting internetworking issues with any vendor(Cisco, Juniper, etc).  UNIX/Linux experience is also welcome.  We're not all that particular on skillset we just want to hire smart, motivated technology generalists.<p>We are a networking equipment manufacturer that makes really fast and really dense ethernet switches.  We're not a startup, but we're also not a large company.  So individual contributors can still have an impact.<p>Our primary product is our custom OS based on Linux that runs on our entire product line.  Your job would primarily be as a customer facing test engineer reproducing and understanding bugs in this OS and associated hardware.  You would work mostly in a lab with packet generators and switches/routers where you would simulate different network conditions and try to make things break.<p>Message me if you're interested.","time":1341154736,"type":"comment"}
