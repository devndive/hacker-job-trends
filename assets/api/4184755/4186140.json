{"by":"mikebabineau","dead":true,"id":4186140,"parent":4184755,"text":"Rumble - SF Bay Area (Redwood Shores)<p>We're a new, well-funded startup making and publishing AAA games for browser and mobile. We're making real games for a large audience. Not ultra casual, not niche-y.<p>Our first title is a cooperative multiplayer 3D action-RPG. Think Diablo on Facebook. But free-to-play, and no big download. No obscure plugins, either -- we use Flash, but you wouldn't believe it. Adobe says they've never seen a higher-quality in Flash.<p>Seriously, check out our trailer: <a href=\"https://www.rumblegames.com/kingsroad\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.rumblegames.com/kingsroad</a><p>We're in closed beta. Let me know if you want to give it a test drive.<p>Rumble is backed by Google Ventures and Khosla Ventures ($15mm series A). We have one of the strongest founding teams the gaming industry has ever seen. (No, really: <a href=\"https://www.rumblegames.com/about/our-team\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.rumblegames.com/about/our-team</a>)<p>We're both a developer and publisher of games, and we need help on both sides. If you want to develop the next generation of top-quality games, or you want to build and scale infrastructure to 1mm+ concurrent players, this is for you.<p>Positions: <a href=\"https://www.rumblegames.com/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.rumblegames.com/careers</a><p>Engineers<p>* Platform -- Java/Groovy/Grails/AWS (esp.
