Using the basic concept of detecting nodes and arcs, these applications solve problems in manufacturing, retail, and law enforcement. This computation, plus big datasets, create some complicated problems. Our software engineering team takes algorithms from our research team and embeds them into Ruby on Rails web applications which are hosted on the Amazon Elastic Cloud.<p>We are looking for more developers to join our team. If you mastered the concepts behind web development and have experience dealing with the web stack, Emcien is willing to train you in Ruby on Rails. This position is an excellent opportunity for anyone who wants to make the transition from Java, .NET, Python, Php, or oCaml.<p>Since we are a small, delta-force team of developers, each team member dives into a variety of code. Although you do not have to be an expert in each of these areas, this position will expose you to CoffeeScript, MySql, Amazon RDS, SASS, HAML, Backbone.js, and several other technologies.
