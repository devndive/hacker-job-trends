We've spent the last two and a half years building up this technology, and we're gearing up for a big release later this year.  We've got a very ambitious roadmap, with a lot of challenges ahead.<p>We're looking for both core developers to work on our distributed networking services, using mainly Java, Scala, and some low level C.  We integrate our networking solution into open source clouds such as OpenStack, so there is also some open source python opportunities there.<p>We're also looking for front-end developers to work on our network management GUI written in backbone JS.<p>Our roots come from Japan, but we're a global team with offices in Tokyo, San Francisco, and Barcelona.  You'll get chances to visit these awesome cities around the world to work face to face with your team.  We're funded by strategic investors such as NTT, the worlds second largest telecommunications company.<p>We're 20 people now in total, and hoping to grow our awesome team.
