We recently closed $7MM in funding, which we're using to expand the team and ramp up developer outreach, as well as put on huge events like our app challenge last month[1]. Mega bonus points if you've got tons of experience building or heavily consuming APIs, but if you're smart and like burritos, let's chat. Apply through <a href=\"https://singly.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://singly.com/jobs</a> or kristjan@singly.com. Or, just come hang with us in #singly on irc.freenode.net and at our monthly happy hours [2].<p>Happy hunting!<p>[1] <a href=\"http://blog.singly.com/2012/06/13/our-first-big-hack-event-was-a-total-success-heres-how-and-why-we-did-it/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.singly.com/2012/06/13/our-first-big-hack-event-w...</a> [2] <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Singly-Happy-Hour/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.meetup.com/Singly-Happy-Hour/</a>","time":1341170878,"type":"comment"}
