I'm Jesse, one of the founders of Everlane.<p><a href=\"http://www.everlane.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.everlane.com</a><p>We're trying to re-imagine retail online and make it easy to find products that match your taste and style. Right now we're focused on mens fashion, but our ambitions are much larger.<p>pg did a good job of explaining the opportunity, here: <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/rfs2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ycombinator.com/rfs2.html</a><p>We're building a members-only club where each month we produce and release a new collection of mens accessories and apparel.  Yes, we're selling our own products, directly to consumers.<p>This lets us offer a tie you'd buy for $80 at Nordstrom's for half that.  To produce in-style products we have a team of curators, run the largest men's fashion Tumblr, and are generally data-savvy people.<p>You can read my (somewhat out of date) blog, here: <a href=\"http://20bits.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://20bits.com</a><p>We're well-funded by the most stylish investors around.<p>We offer competitive salary, equity, and benefits.  Our office is in Union Square in San Francisco, CA.<p>If you're a hacker, love data, and/or love style shoot me an email at jesse@everlane.com and get in touch.<p>Also, if you're up to the challenge, here is a little exercise for you: <a href=\"http://static.everlane.com/everlane_exercise.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://static.everlane.com/everlane_exercise.pdf</a>","time":1312224026,"type":"comment"}
