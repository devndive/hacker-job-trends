We are working on the next computing paradigm: Neuromorphic Computing, literally computers based on the brain. Part of this effort is to create the tool, an IDE, to be used in the design and develop the neural systems based on our technologies. Think Eclipse or XCode for the brain.<p>The tool will be used to design, visualize, run and analyze large neural systems and we want it to be available to everyone so we are putting it on the web. To accomplish this we will be pushing the limits of what can be done in a browser. Utilizing all the latest technologies in HTML5: Canvas, WebGL, etc, to create a rich client side user interface as well as C++ for a high performance backend.<p>Must be familiar with the newest HTML5 Javascript APIs, e.g. WebGL and Canvas, as well as be a master at squeezing all the functionality out of the older APIs.<p>General OO design and C++ experience and a willingness to learn engineering based neuroscience also required.<p>OpenGL, GUI development, familiarity with Agile development practices, and a familiarity with the Linux development environment desired.<p>Apply here:\n<a href=\"https://jobs.qualcomm.com/public/jobDetails.xhtml?requisitionId=1888782\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://jobs.qualcomm.com/public/jobDetails.xhtml?requisitio...</a>","time":1312234095,"type":"comment"}
