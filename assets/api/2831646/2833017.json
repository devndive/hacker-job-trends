As the stack matures, we may release the source. The web application is nearly all single-page architecture. We use coffeescript pretty much everywhere, including our javascript tests.<p>backend:  python, django, gevent, gunicorn, nginx, postgres<p>frontend: coffeescript, jQuery, backbone.js, socket.io, compass<p>We're looking for:<p>1. One advanced web jack-of-many-trades. You know a lot about several things from above and have at least tried your hand at a demo app using the rest. Backend/frontend/deployment. We'll be growing our user base very soon and need knowledge/experience scaling the above technologies. We're on the lookout for locals (or those who can move to the bay) who want senior developer ownership and can be mentors/leaders as we grow.<p>2. Talented web and mobile designers (referrals would also be good). Even with the nifty tech we're building, our app will probably live/die based on making an intuitive UI with fun and easy experience. There are several unique challenges in this product that require novel controls -- creativity is a must. Would be great if you have more than just design skills, but very high quality design is more important than ability to build it.<p>gmail - davidmarble","time":1312216323,"type":"comment"}
