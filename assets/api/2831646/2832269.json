{"by":"rarrrrrr","id":2832269,"parent":2831646,"text":"Americas and Europe (remote): SpiderOak is looking for mobile engineering help<p>Since 2006, SpiderOak provides an easy, consolidated free online backup, sync, sharing, access &#38; storage solution for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux with a zero-knowledge approach to encryption and customer privacy.  (You could think of SpiderOak as Dropbox for power users.)  We use Python, Django, web.py, WSGI, jQuery, PostgreSQL, nginx, 0mq, gevent, with some occasional heavy-lifting help from C, Erlang and Perl.<p>SpiderOak is a distributed, virtual company - we all set our own work schedule and work from home, coffee shops, or anywhere. We coordinate via Wikis, IRC, email, telepathy, and even face-to-face when possible. We don't bother with time sheets or other types of wage accounting -- we're a tight enough group that it would be obvious if someone wasn't doing her or his job.<p>We've noticed that some of the most accomplished people we know don't necessarily have polished resumes. As such, we don't care about formal education, age, gender, geographic location, resume, etc. We like smart people who love what they do and do it really well. Period.<p>If you're interested, please send a introduction letter to team+DDMMYYYY@spideroak.com making the obvious substitutions.","time":1312208723,"type":"comment"}
