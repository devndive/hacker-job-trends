Our aim is to be the first port of call for developers looking to build realtime functionality.<p>If you share our enthusiasm for the realtime web, want to be part of this grand ideal, and can abide our continued over-use of the word “awesome”, drop us a line.<p>We need developers and ops peeps to work on making the Pusher platform more awesome, and more scalable. Previous experience with distributed systems is essential, whether it be Ruby, Node.js or Erlang.<p>We’re still a smallish team (7 in total) and there are great opportunities for having an influence in something really exciting. We’re based in London (EC1), and we’re looking for people who can work on site with us.<p><a href=\"http://jobs.github.com/positions/fd968a9a-b79d-11e0-95ed-aadcc5809197\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jobs.github.com/positions/fd968a9a-b79d-11e0-95ed-aad...</a>","time":1312207530,"type":"comment"}
