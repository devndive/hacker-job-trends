We're a group of friends who came together to help all kinds of web business increase their awesomeness.  Initially, we focused on marketing + strategy, but clients always wanted help with implementation, so we started doing a bit of dev work.  Now we're doing lots of dev work from building mobile apps to simple JS tweaks to full-stack rebuilds to large CMS implementations.<p>Anyways, if you're game to play with lots of different technologies and clients, give a shout.  And we're looking for all kinds of dev help.  We'd love you to join us forever and ever and ever, but we're realistic: consulting is often a temporary thing as you plot the next steps in your career and that's fine with us.  We're also happy to help you increase your runway if you're working on your own thing.  Need awesome design work, some strategy, a bit of social media advice?  We're happy to help you when you help us.<p>More here:\n<a href=\"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/eng/2516921876.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/eng/2516921876.html</a><p>Web: www.roi-dna.com<p>Email: jobs@roimarketinginc.com [our old domain...]","time":1312219211,"type":"comment"}
