We're hiring senior and graduate software engineers in the next quarter, plus a whole bunch of other roles. We're not looking for any skills in particular, just smart people.<p>Qubit Group is a 18 month-old company founded by 4 ex-Googlers. We're in the business of making company's websites perform better, by generating rule-based concrete advice.<p>We've a bunch of huge clients already, and are trying to keep up with growth!
