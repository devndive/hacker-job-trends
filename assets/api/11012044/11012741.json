The projects you&#x27;ll work on as an intern at Basecamp are all derived from real problems we face as a business, and we expect you&#x27;ll have a meaningful impact during your time here. You&#x27;ll leave Basecamp with new technical, creative, and business skills and having accomplished something significant.<p>Internships at Basecamp are remote -- you can work from anywhere you want, provided there&#x27;s some overlap in time zones with your assigned mentor. We&#x27;ll fly you to Chicago once or twice during the summer to get together with your mentor and the rest of the intern class, and you&#x27;ll talk regularly with your mentor via phone, Skype, or Google Hangouts. You&#x27;ll also participate in some of our dozens of Campfire chat rooms every day.<p>All internships are paid and require a commitment of 8-12 weeks of full time work between May and August 2016 (we&#x27;re flexible on start&#x2F;end dates, planned vacations, etc.).<p>Learn more and apply via <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;basecamp.com&#x2F;internships\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;basecamp.com&#x2F;internships</a>. Apply by Wednesday, February 24th.<p>If you have any questions, you can email me directly at noah@basecamp.com.","time":1454344186,"type":"comment"}
