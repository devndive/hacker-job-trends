We build the products that showcase our diverse and important journalism. We create the tools that the journalists and editors use to write their stories securely, anywhere from London to Syria. We write the APIs and services that allow those stories to be distributed across the globe. We write the products and interfaces that show off and monetise that content to its maximum potential.<p>We mostly program in Scala and Javascript, but we use the best tool that fits the problem. We have hacks in the wild in all manner of languages. Our infrastructure lives on AWS and our own OpenStack private cloud. We encourage product teams to implement, manage and support their own stack. We do our coding in public. Sadly, the same can be said of our karaoke.<p>Youâ€™re a passionate, intelligent human being who loves technology.
