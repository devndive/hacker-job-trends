Some of the other technologies we use are: Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS), Docker, Ansible, C, C++, Julia, R, Go, JavaScript, AngularJS, Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, Apache Spark, RabbitMQ, Celery, Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Graphite, Sentry, Git, GitLab.<p>We have a very flat hierarchy and an emphasis on developer freedom. We encourage people to work on areas of the code base that interest them, because we believe developers are happiest and most productive when intellectually stimulated.<p>We are looking for developers who have solid fundamentals in programming and maths and an ability to pick up new technologies. You don&#x27;t need to be interested in sports or betting.<p>If this appeals to you, please email hn@gambitresearch.com","time":1454342487,"type":"comment"}
