We would prefer on-site, but for the the right candidate we will allow remote. Also a plus if you can geek out on data as we are moving towards analytics and machine learning on our rapidly growing dataset.<p>If you want to find out more or meet for up for a coffee, email me: eugene_alfonso@bluenrgy.com with the subject HN.","time":1454387135,"type":"comment"}
