More than 20 million people buy from Etsy each year and we have 1.5 million sellers offering 36 million unique handmade, vintage, and craft items.<p>The people are really smart, friendly, a little quirky, and they care a lot about the product, the infrastructure, and the community. If you have read our engineering blog, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeascraft.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeascraft.com&#x2F;</a>, you know these folks know their stuff.<p>Feel free to reach out or comment with questions.<p>Jason<p>Full-Stack Software Engineer<p>You&#x27;ll be helping us build new and awesome experiences for people shopping on Etsy. We&#x27;re looking for full-stack engineers - you&#x27;ll be dealing with the MySQL, Memcache, PHP, and front-end stuff (HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS). The teams working on each feature are pretty small (a few engineers, a designer, and a product manager), so there&#x27;s a lot of meaningful collaboration.<p>Because we&#x27;re making user-facing features, we believe strongly in collecting and analyzing numerical data to help guide our decisions. To that end, you&#x27;ll be able to use our in-house analytics tools to gather information and gain insights. You&#x27;ll also be able to use Etsy&#x27;s Continuous Deployment architecture to push code to production whenever you please (and you&#x27;ll probably push on your first day here).<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etsy.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;job&#x2F;oJoaWfwX\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etsy.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;job&#x2F;oJoaWfwX</a>","time":1454360371,"type":"comment"}
