We consistently lead the pack in every measure of customer love (net promoter scores, app store ratings, etc) because delightful customer experiences in travel are why we exist.<p>We value the same high standards in our code and people.  We value learning and growth (and not having bored people) and invest regular time in doing so.  For example, every other Friday is open time for you to spend time becoming a better engineer.<p>Our stack is built on PostgreSQL, Redis, Python, nginx, HBase, Coffeescript, React.js, es6, Swift, and a few more things.  Steve, our cofounder, built Reddit with many of those and they&#x27;ve proven solid throughout the years.<p>We hire diverse, well-rounded, communicative people we can envision being friends with and trusting.  Our projects tend to be 1-2 engineers max so trust and accountability is required for us to work.  Also helps us keep processes &amp; overhead low.  We appreciate that we&#x27;ve built a reasonably-sized, high-powered team so far (76 employees incl. 38 engineers) and are always striving to be the best place to work for them.<p>We&#x27;re looking for folks that love all of the above and will help us keep our standards high.
