We look for aptitude over APIs. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether your resum√© says PHP or PhD: if you&#x27;re smart, know some stuff and have empathy, we want to work with you.<p>Pivotal&#x27;s goal is to change the way the world makes software and we kinda sorta <i>really mean it</i>. We&#x27;re broken into three basic divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data. Rotations between divisions, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>We have offices in San Francisco, New York City, Santa Monica, Palo Alto, Seattle, Boulder, Denver, Chicago, Boston, Washington DC, Toronto, London, Dublin, Tokyo, Berlin and Sydney. More offices are coming soon. Relocations, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>Each of the three divisions has a constantly evolving and deliberately cross-pollinated culture. We are constantly thinking about how we work and how we can work more sensibly, effectively and enjoyably. Right now we are particularly trying to grow in Labs and Cloud Foundry.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i>, from which the company draws its name and cultural seed, helps clients to become better at development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels. We have a growing data science practice, and some engagements include all four roles.<p>-- <i>Cloud Foundry</i> solves application deployment and management. We&#x27;re the main contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. We&#x27;re constantly improving the leading opensource PaaS -- our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i>.<p>It&#x27;s also the only PaaS I&#x27;d personally bet a company on. Except for integrated upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform bar none.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, good benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong is not mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The beer fridge has more IPA than I prefer but I guess that&#x27;s life in paradise.<p>You can apply through our website: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pivotal.io&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pivotal.io&#x2F;careers</a>.  You can also email me at jchester+hn@pivotal.io to answer any questions you might have and potentially help me score one of our generous referral bonuses.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m just an engineer.
