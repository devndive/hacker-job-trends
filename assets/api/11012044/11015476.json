The Star Tribune is in the latter category. We&#x27;re a modern tech shop, and as an ops engineer in the style of devops, you&#x27;ll be playing with such fun toys as AWS, Python, Go, Ansible, Packer, Docker, Vagrant, Prometheus, and similar. We believe in using the right tool for the job, building up our teammates as much as building up our sites and apps, and exploring the digital frontier. We&#x27;re exploring how to use tech of tomorrow to make consuming the news more awesome - yes, that includes the Oculus Rift and HoloLens.<p>If you like continuous deployment, containers, automation, and learning new things, you&#x27;ll love working with us.<p>I&#x27;m the hiring manager and the guy who&#x27;d be your immediate boss, so feel free to ask me anything.","time":1454361052,"type":"comment"}
