Companies use Tesorio to offer their suppliers and vendors faster payments in exchange for small discounts. Suppliers love this because they get paid faster instead of waiting 30, 60 or 90 days. Companies love this because those small discounts represent great, risk free returns on cash.<p>We raised a seed round led by top investors including First Round Capital (Uber + Warby Parker), Floodgate Capital (Twitter + Lyft), Fuel Capital (Layer + CoreOS), Red Swan (Coinbase + Buffer), Slow Ventures (early Facebook team), and Paul Buchheit (creator of Gmail, YC Partner).<p>Senior Full-Stack Engineer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;tesorio&#x2F;3355b2ed-0435-401a-878d-b0b2d8b299c7\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;tesorio&#x2F;3355b2ed-0435-401a-878d-b0b2d8...</a>","time":1454352429,"type":"comment"}
