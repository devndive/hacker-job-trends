SecureDrop is currently used in over 15 major newsrooms, including those of the Washington Post, the Guardian, the New Yorker, and ProPublica. [0]<p>One of our big challenges moving forward is scaling. For legal and security reasons, we require every organization to deploy their own SecureDrop instance on dedicated hardware. We do not offer SecureDrop &quot;as a service&quot;. As a result, traditional scaling techniques do not apply. However, we believe that by automating the testing, development, deployment, and troubleshooting of SecureDrop systems, we can continue to support a growing base of SecureDrop installs without becoming overwhelmed. That&#x27;s where you come in :)<p>For more information on the job, see our full job description, which includes instructions for applying: <a href=\"https://freedom.press/jobs/job-opening-devops-engineer-securedrop\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freedom.press&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;job-opening-devops-engineer-secur...</a><p>[0] <a href=\"https://freedom.press/securedrop/directory\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freedom.press&#x2F;securedrop&#x2F;directory</a>","time":1420216565,"type":"comment"}
