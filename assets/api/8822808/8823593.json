Being backed by a leader in weight loss programs has many advantages, we have an abundance of users, resources and data.<p>Here&#x27;s why:\nWe were a team of 4 acquired by Weight Watchers International, a brand recognized by almost everyone, including our moms.\nWe are left alone to build new products for WW and have some interesting products we are working on.\nWe have to worry less about stability, legal and other non-technical stuff and can focus on doing what we love.\nWe offer competitive compensation and great health benefits.\nAll 4 of us are staying and now growing. We just hired our intern full-time! We love what we do and believe in our mission to make people healthier. We have diverse backgrounds (Stanford, Bain, Google, Netflix) and we are looking for you to come join and teach us new tricks!\nIf you are interested, email me at amol dot kher at weightwatchers dot com and we can catch up over phone or coffee.","time":1420134698,"type":"comment"}
