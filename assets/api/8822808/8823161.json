We all work remotely on the team - currently spread out in Australia, Singapore, and Poland. We have close ties to Microsoft (via mgmt) and are leveraging the MS stack heavily on the back-end (ASP.Net, Azure, etc.)<p>We&#x27;re looking for:<p>1) Windows Phone, Android&#x2F;iOS (Xamarin) Developer<p>We are presently working on a Windows Phone application to be deployed in a B2B type environment with consumer-facing iOS, Android, and Windows Phone applications to also be developed. We have standardized on C# and Xamarin for the app development.<p>Ideally you will have a demonstrated experience using .NET&#x2F;C# and Xamarin for mobile app development, but developers with only native iOS and Android development experience will also be considered. Specific experience developing for Windows Phone is nice to have, but not necessary.<p>2) Back-end ASP.Net Engineer<p>You must have a strong demonstrable experience with ASP.NET Web Api, ADO.Net, MS SQL Server and be comfortable with handling devops type work within Azure (deployment, management, scaling). Your role will be to build out a fast, secure back-end and APIs in support of consumer-facing apps &amp; website.<p>For both roles prior experience working remotely is a plus. Above all though, we&#x27;re looking for smart people with a can do attitude.<p>Contact me at neil@rateitnow.com","time":1420126081,"type":"comment"}
