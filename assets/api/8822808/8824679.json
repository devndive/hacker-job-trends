If you can name a software challenge, we are addressing it to solve our customers&#x27; problems.<p>We are the fastest growing BI software company, and headed to being the fastest growing enterprise software company...but we&#x27;re really doing that by being an any-knowledge-worker software company in disguise. Better yet, we are an open, collaborative, fast-growing software company with a data visualization product people describe using the words &quot;fast, easy, beautiful.&quot;<p>This is a great company. I started there earlier this year. The development team is top notch, the sales team knows how to treat customers, and HR knows how to take care of us.<p><a href=\"http://careers.tableausoftware.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.tableausoftware.com&#x2F;</a><p>Contact me directly and I&#x27;ll help make sure your resume ends up in the right place.
