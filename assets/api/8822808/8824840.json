Our holographic images spring out of tables, walls, or other objects; you can walk around them, lean in, and see that they appear as real parts of the world.  Since you look at a normal distance, we don&#x27;t have the near eye issues (distortion, nausea etc) of VR and since our glasses are open and light you can wear them to work or play for hours.   We support new sorts of games in which you can see your other players, see shared (or slightly different world), and interact with both.  Games, visualization, CAD and other applications can make use of our new display.<p>We are looking for looking for hot MEs, EEs, robot &#x2F; vision and gaming hackers in Mountain View.<p>We are a small, dedicated team of 10 hackers with experience in building hardware, software and successful companies. If you&#x27;re a GNU hacker you might know me, or you may know one of our founders, Jeri Ellsworth, renowned hacker and maker. We are building a fun, no bull, buzzword-free business.  We&#x27;re not just going after the big guys -- it&#x27;s in our DNA to support social, user-generated content and make it possible for hackers to do things we can&#x27;t imagine ourselves.  We have a lot of fun things in our pipeline.<p>If you enjoy hard work on fun engineering problems, come join us on the ground floor as we build the next great user experience.<p>Write to us at jobs[at]technicalillusions.com","time":1420156480,"type":"comment"}
