The bulk of R&amp;D will be done in the Helsinki office which at the moment only has a small team, so this is a great opportunity to get in early and grow with the company.<p>As a backend engineer you’ll be part of the team responsible for infrastructure code handling millions of events each month. Tasks will include improving existing components and creating new systems for scaling, automating and monitoring of processes. Knowledge of Perl &amp; Bash is expected, however if you’re more comfortable with another dynamic language like Python or Ruby and have a good grasp of low level Linux, we should still talk. Familiarity with C would also be an advantage.<p>As a UX designer you will be responsible for a creating the UIs and improving the UX of Omniata&#x27;s web interfaces that allow Omniata&#x27;s customers to make the most of their data. Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript would be a plus, but is not a must.<p>If you&#x27;re at all interested in this area and Helsinki as a place to live and work, drop a one line email with a link to your LinkedIn and GitHub profile (in the case of backend) or portfolio (in the case of UX) to careers-hl@omniata.com","time":1420119308,"type":"comment"}
