Whatever you say, just starts happening around you. It&#x27;s a little crazy. We&#x27;re very early (two of us), pre-product, post-prototype, funded, and excited to be working from first principles to figure out what it means to think and create inside this new medium.<p>I previously made Simplenote&#x2F;Simperium (YC S10), which we sold to WordPress.com, and before that I worked at Irrational Games (makers of BioShock). My co-founder Katrika led design on Labs teams for Office, Xbox, and Windows at Microsoft. It&#x27;s just the two of us. This is our first public job posting. We don&#x27;t have a hiring page yet. Our site will be refreshed soon (moatboat.com).<p>We don&#x27;t have free lunch or lots of ping pong tables. We&#x27;re not killing it or growing explosively or hiring Engineer #20 to fulfill specific duty X.<p>We do have reasonable salary, generous equity, a strategy&#x2F;runway for riding out the VR hype until it goes mainstream, and many fun technical and design challenges. We&#x27;re looking for another lady and&#x2F;or gentleman to join the founding team as peers. A good fit could be a very experienced fullstack or frontend dev looking to dive into something more game-like, or an experienced game dev looking to build something that&#x27;s not just fun, but also impactful. hello-AT our domain if you&#x27;re looking for a change.","time":1467393641,"type":"comment"}
