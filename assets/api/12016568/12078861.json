Our public site is powered by Django and the Django-REST-framework amongst other things - we also use Pandas, Numpy and Jupyter for analysis and forecasting.<p>We use AWS heavily, employing most of the Hashistack (Vagrant, Packer, Consul, Terraform) in some form. See, for example, <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.octopus.energy&#x2F;2016&#x2F;05&#x2F;05&#x2F;django-elb-health-checks.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.octopus.energy&#x2F;2016&#x2F;05&#x2F;05&#x2F;django-elb-health-chec...</a><p>On the client-side, we use React and SASS. For our mobile apps, we use React Native.<p>We use a Kanban approach to development and use Atlas to coordinate a continuous deployment pipeline. Engineering standards are high. All code is well tested and thoroughly reviewed.<p>This is a great opportunity for several reasons:<p>* We have lots of difficult design challenges to solve. The UK energy market is complicated, dated and process-heavy - there&#x27;s an awful lot of domain modelling that we need to get right.<p>* We have difficult technical problems to solve. With the advent of smart meters, we&#x27;ll soon be processing millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption.<p>* There&#x27;s a great opportunity for disruption in the UK energy market. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not exactly popular. The energy landscape is changing as we move to more disaggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology.<p>* You&#x27;ll be working for a company that is helping to tackle climate change. We&#x27;ll be helping move people onto using greener technology and consuming energy from renewable sources. This will all help transition the UK towards a lower carbon future.<p>Apply via talent@octopus.energy","time":1468331202,"type":"comment"}
