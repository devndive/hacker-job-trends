We use that to set insurance prices. To provide the best pricing and experience possible, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.<p>We&#x27;re currently at 10 people, we&#x27;re well funded, and we&#x27;re looking to bring on a couple more talented engineers. Tech stack involves Rails, iOS&#x2F;Swift, and JS&#x2F;React. Email me at dan@joinroot.com if you&#x27;re interested in this space and want to chat.","time":1467413537,"type":"comment"}
