We are developing whole-cell computational models which comprehensively predict how behavior emerges from the molecular level by representing all of the biochemical activity inside cells. Our goal is to use whole-cell models to transform bioengineering and medicine into rigorous, quantitative disciplines. For example, we believe that whole-cell models could enable bioengineers to design microbial genomes for a variety of industrial applications, as well as enable physicians to tailor medical therapy to individual patients. Our research is highly interdisciplinary, involving systems biology, genomics, bioinformatics, data integration, parallel simulation, optimization, software engineering, and data visualization, and highly team-oriented.<p>More information: Please see our website (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.karrlab.org&#x2F;join\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.karrlab.org&#x2F;join</a>) or contact Jonathan Karr (karr@mssm.edu).<p>How to apply: Please send a cover letter outlining your research interests and a CV to Jonathan Karr (karr@mssm.edu).","time":1468268362,"type":"comment"}
