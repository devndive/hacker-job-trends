We have a culture where every engineer has an impact.  It&#x27;s an extremely collaborative environment where smart people can thrive and learn from each other.  LEARN EVERY DAY! Engineers are tasked with solving hard problems and have ownership over the solution.  We tend to work in small development teams to keep things moving fast (3-5 engineers).  We want our engineers to stick around a while and have a fantastic work life balance.<p>We have two apps that are business workflow solutions for small to medium sized law firms and property managers.  We mostly speak Ruby on Rails but don&#x27;t hire for &#x27;Rails Engineers&#x27;; we want smart software engineers who have a passion for collaboratively solving hard problems.
