We have developed a new algorithm for identifying music at massive scale, and are working with music labels and major online platforms to connect creators and rights-holders to monetisation opportunities. We’ve performed extensive trials with multiple platforms, and based on that, we know that our machine-learning method leads the field by a huge margin.<p>Our underlying audio identification system is built on a highly optimised set of in-memory databases, message queues, and computation workers. It compares half an hour of music per second against a database with millions of tracks - that’s more audio than most of the largest online platforms retrieve per second. We are looking for a senior developer to help us grow a SaaS system around it.<p>Our current API and dashboards are built around Rails with React.js. We are also considering migrating to Elixir and Phoenix, so if this sparks your interest, please mention it in your email.<p>We offer:<p>- Salary range between £55k-75k<p>- Offices at WeWork Old Street, with all the typical amenities you&#x27;d expect<p>- A great team of highly skilled researchers, computer scientists and music industry experts<p>- Great discounts on vinyl and audio equipment through our music industry partners<p>To apply, send your CV to jobs@sonalytic.com. We&#x27;ll then arrange a coding interview with you.","time":1467405804,"type":"comment"}
