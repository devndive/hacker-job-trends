At Walmart, the possibilities are limitless and the people here in Reston are amazin (I actually mean this, I am a software engineer who just started last November and I am astonished at the projects I have been able to work on so far and the technologies I have used). We are a new team, the oldest member has been here a bit over a year, and we are trying to find the brightest and best software engineers anywhere in the world. We need them as the scale of the problems we are trying to solve is huge and we focus on creating elegant solutions for those problems. One big plus also is that we encourage continous learning and we love it when you contribute (or have contributed) to an open source project. We want to give back to the community in different ways too (we volunteer, and do meetups frequently). So if you are super smart, like to be surrounded by smart people, and like to solve difficult distributed problems, you should contact us!<p>Just a note. For Junior devs, fresh out of school, we don&#x27;t care what language you code in (even though we use Java here for the most part so at least you should be willing to learn it). For everyone else, we&#x27;d expect you to have a good working knowledge of at least one JVM language.<p>Get in touch at wmtech.reston@gmail.com","time":1467493065,"type":"comment"}
