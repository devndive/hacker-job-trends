We&#x27;re in the middle of transitioning from a traditional &quot;devs build, ops run&quot; environment to a microservice driven &quot;devs build and run their own services&quot; world.  We&#x27;re looking for experienced engineers who have either been through or worked on the other side of this transition to help us build, improve, and deliver building blocks to the developers.<p>We&#x27;re especially interested in anyone with real world docker experience (I&#x27;d be double thrilled if you&#x27;ve played with Kubernetes) who has seen beyond the shiny marketing and experienced the world of pain that Docker can bring.<p>We&#x27;re hiring locally in Boston at this time.
