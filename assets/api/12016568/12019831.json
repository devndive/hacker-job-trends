It&#x27;s frustrating for banks and even more frustrating for their customers. We&#x27;re a small team of predominantly ex-Standard Treasury [1] engineers working to change that, one API at a time.<p>We&#x27;re looking for generalist and backend engineers of all experience levels. Our tech stack is Clojure and Postgres, but no experience with either is required. Our only hard requirement, and preference, is that you have strong software engineering ability (and that you can pass a background check--sorry, but it&#x27;s a bank requirement).<p>Our office is in downtown San Francisco. I won&#x27;t enumerate all the comp and benefits here, but suffice it to say, we try to make both competitive and lucrative. Notably, if you&#x27;d like to live in the Bay Area, and don&#x27;t live here now, we will pay to relocate you!<p>If you&#x27;re interested in working with us or learning more, email me at: jbrusstar@svb.com<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Standard_Treasury\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Standard_Treasury</a>","time":1467408805,"type":"comment"}
