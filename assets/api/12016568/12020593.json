What makes our team interesting is that we have a great engineering team working with medical doctors to solve some of the most complex problems in healthcare.  We&#x27;re currently looking for many positions (android, frontend, backend, infra) across our engineering team.  More descriptions can be found on our jobs page (below), but if you&#x27;re in the area I&#x27;d love to just grab coffee regardless of whether or not you&#x27;re actively looking to move -- I love talking to other passionate, driven people about what they do.<p>For those interested in some specifics: We have Android, iOS, and web (backbone, react) products. We&#x27;re currently running most of our API on Rails but heavily migrating toward Scala for most of our backend&#x2F;data services. Other keywords in case someone is searching: Spark, Spark Streaming, Akka, Python, Mesos.<p>Jobs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wellframe.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wellframe.com&#x2F;jobs</a><p>Also feel free to reach out to me at jeff@wellframe.com!","time":1467417633,"type":"comment"}
