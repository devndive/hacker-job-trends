We believe we have a great opportunity to address huge inefficiencies caused in part by a fragmented logistics software landscape.\nWe are not a typical startup – we’re affiliated with a medium-sized logistics company that has plenty of its own operational issues, and this gives us a few key advantages. We have firsthand knowledge of the problem domain, so the solutions we’re developing are targeting real problems that many of our competitors face. When we’re ready to release, we can utilize our affiliate’s industry connections to facilitate sales. And we don’t have funding concerns, which gives us stability and lets us focus on our product’s quality above all else.<p><i>What You’ll Do</i><p>-Help design the core architecture that will drive our platform<p>-Tackle problems unique to integrating big data<p><i>What You’ll Need</i><p>-Backend C# experience, big data experience a plus<p>-Talent for creative and functional solutions to difficult problems<p>-Strong computer science fundamentals<p>-A stomach for working in a fast-paced and uncertain problem domain<p>-Ability to ship quality code quickly<p><i>Compensation</i><p>-Competitive base salary<p>-Stock options<p>-Medical, dental, and other benefits<p>Thank you","time":1467394476,"type":"comment"}
