Weâ€™ve created the software to create unique manufacturing as a scaleable service. This allows customers to get involved in the design process, see a photo-realistic preview of their garment, and have it knitted on one of our in-house industrial knitting machines. We&#x27;re now partnering with bigger brands to take these tools to a global scale and are working to integrate our technology in a range of websites and factories throughout the world.<p>All of our backend code is written in Python, from our Django-based websites, through to our knitting machine compiler. We practice continuous deployment, using Docker on AWS.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a Senior Python developer to help us out across our full product range. Prior knowledge of knitting is not required!<p>Background about the business:<p>New York Times:\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;04&#x2F;01&#x2F;fashion&#x2F;fashion-knitwear-unmade.html?_r=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;04&#x2F;01&#x2F;fashion&#x2F;fashion-knitwear-u...</a><p>Knitting Industry: \n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.knittingindustry.com&#x2F;unmade-studio-its-knitwear-manufacturing-but-not-as-we-know-it\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.knittingindustry.com&#x2F;unmade-studio-its-knitwear-m...</a><p>Email dan@unmade.com with a CV and GitHub profile if you&#x27;re interested!","time":1467394891,"type":"comment"}
