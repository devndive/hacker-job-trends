Over the past couple of years, we&#x27;ve worked hard to migrate our entire web application stack to Node and powerful client-side apps and we&#x27;re looking to turn the dial towards product experimentation and innovation. We need your engineering ability and your desire to be a part of the whole product!<p>I personally lead the Online Checkout (exactly what it sounds like, &quot;Pay with PayPal&quot;) engineering team and I&#x27;m happy to talk with you directly. You can reach out to me at my HN username at paypal.com. My team is currently working primarily with Angular on the client and Kraken on Node. If you&#x27;ve got experience with React, we&#x27;re actively beginning an inside-out migration of our application and could use your expertise. As most Node shops go, we&#x27;re leveraging a whole lot of other open source tools as well and we&#x27;re very supportive of open source activities for our people--including working on releasing some of our own work as open source over the past few weeks.<p>Please note; due to US Government deadlines, we are not able to apply for new Visas at this time. If you have a current US Visa, we are able to sponsor a transfer.","time":1467388106,"type":"comment"}
