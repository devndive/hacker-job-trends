We offer a 4 week part-time prep program for people who are considering a career change, before they make the leap into a larger investment in their coding education.<p>Courses are in evenings from 6:30pm-9:30pm PST, so you don&#x27;t have to quit your day job to help out as an instructor.<p>You also do not need to have teaching experience to apply. This is a great way to try out teaching with a light commitment if it&#x27;s something you&#x27;ve thought about before.<p>You can reach me at: andy@firststepcoding.com\nYou can read more info about the program at: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;firststepcoding.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;firststepcoding.com</a>","time":1467393346,"type":"comment"}
