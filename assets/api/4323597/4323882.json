We're more than that, though, and we're looking for a couple people to help us take it to the next level.<p>We're hiring for two positions right now:<p>Front-end Engineer:<p>We want someone who is in to javascript, HTML, CSS, and maybe a bit of photoshop. We've grown our API, but our customer-facing site is lagging a bit. Specifically we want to present our analytics data in a better way. We've got more in the pipe, of course, but details are sparse for now.<p>---<p>Natural Language Processing / Machine Learning Engineer:<p>As I mentioned above, we're looking to take our API to the next level. NLP/ML is going to be a large part of this. We have access to a fantastic amount of data, and we want someone to help us leverage it.<p>Right now we have some NLP/ML stuff dealing with textual content extraction. We want to do some semantic analysis and categorization to come up with information that is useful to our customers.<p>---<p>Our team is still small, fewer than 10 people, so you'll mostly be doing your own driving when it comes to your projects.<p>Despite the small team, we have a serious customer base, and are actually making money.<p>We aren't able to sponsor candidates from outside the US, sorry.<p>Get in touch! team@embed.ly","time":1343838630,"type":"comment"}
