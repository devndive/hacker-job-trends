Our software helps scientists manage, analyze and collaborate around their drug discovery data (chemistry and biology). We are are in a great position to support the evolution towards more collaboration, specialization and distribution in a market that has been historically closed and secretive. The model has been successful with academic labs, small biotech startups, very large collaborations (like the Gates foundation TB initiative or MM4TB in Europe), and government agencies.<p>We just grew the software development team from 2 to 5 over the last 3 months bringing in some awesome people and are looking for at least one more full-stack software developer (<a href=\"https://www.collaborativedrug.com/pages/employment\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.collaborativedrug.com/pages/employment</a>). As one of the core developers, you need to be comfortable working or interested in building expertise at every level of the stack.<p>The application is based on Rails but it is way more than a simple CRUD app. We have many projects involving web development, data visualization, data processing, scaling, security, privacy, usability and other software challenges to make our scientific application collaborative, engaging and rewarding. We are also starting working on an API.<p>It is perfectly OK if you do not have experience with any of the languages or technologies we currently use (Ruby/Rails/JS/MySQL/Solr...) as long as you can learn those quickly. CDD is a great place if you want to have a lot of impact and like to take on projects and responsibilities. We offer market salary and meaningful equity.<p>If you are interested, contact work@collaborativedrug.com, you will get an answer from one of the developers.","time":1344138771,"type":"comment"}
