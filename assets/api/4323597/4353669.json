OK, it's MS, but we are still very independent, take lots of risks, and are building mission critical high performance distributed systems.  We are running services at approx 500k tps distributed world wide to support the brilliant concept that is Skype.  The tech stack is nosqlish (azure table store), C# services (F# permitted, we ported stuff from C++ and Erlang to move to Azure).  The location is Palo Alto, CA, US.<p>We need someone who loves to own production systems from conception to support.
