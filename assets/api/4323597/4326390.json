For instance, two weeks ago we had a star from the TV show Glee talking with fans from Italy, Brazil, the UK, and the US. We are well funded, have a team of 20, and have offices in New York and San Francisco. One of the cofounders previously started StubHub and sold it to eBay.<p>We are bringing Spreecast to mobile and are growing a team of engineers in NYC. We are always looking for engineers on our web and infrastructure teams in San Francisco.<p>We're most interested in excellent engineers, regardless of which current language/toolset they're currently using. We believe that excellent engineers can quickly accomplish great things in a language that they don't already know.<p>If interested, please send your resume plus links to apps/websites/projects you have built to robert@spreecast.com","time":1343864440,"type":"comment"}
