What sets Podio apart is how it puts people in control of their work tools, rather than the other way around. You decide how to structure your projects, teams and workflows by creating your own workspaces and sharing them with relevant people. You also decide how to structure, create and present content and information that’s linked to your work processes and interactions. You do this by choosing from hundreds of Podio’s specialized work apps or creating your own to help you get the job done – whatever it is.<p>Now hiring for:<p>- UI/UX Designer: <a href=\"http://blog.podio.com/2012/07/31/designer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.podio.com/2012/07/31/designer/</a><p>- Visual Designer: <a href=\"http://blog.podio.com/2012/07/31/visualdesigner/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.podio.com/2012/07/31/visualdesigner/</a><p>- Director of Marketing: <a href=\"http://blog.podio.com/2012/07/31/marketingdirector/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.podio.com/2012/07/31/marketingdirector/</a><p>- Social Media Manager: <a href=\"http://blog.podio.com/2012/07/31/socialmediamanager/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.podio.com/2012/07/31/socialmediamanager/</a>","time":1343848790,"type":"comment"}
