{"by":"sofuture","id":4323951,"parent":4323597,"text":"Canvas Networks (USV Funded) is looking for engineers #3 and #4 to join a small close team building the rich-media community platform of the future. Our stack is Python/Django/MySQL/Redis/a whole-lot-of JS/EC2 and our deploy process is \"git push\" -- if the tests pass on Jenkins the code is automatically deployed, which happens twenty times a day. We're generalists and looking for the same, so it doesn't matter what specific tools you've used before. If you pick things up quickly, if you're always curious, if you're constantly thinking about the next big problem and solution then we're looking for you.<p>The job title says \"Software Developer\" but really we're looking for \"Software Entrepreneur\" or a \"Startup Engineer\". Shipping a great feature is important, but positively changing user behavior is the ultimate success criteria. Built-to-spec takes a backseat to moves-the-metrics.  If you want to build something you can point at and say \"I made that happen\" then we're looking for you.<p>Things we'd like to see:<p>- Strong development fundamentals<p>- Web development experience<p>- Python experience is a plus, but not requisite<p>- Bonus points for experience with EC2, Redis, Javascript, iOS/Android<p>- Motivated to build stuff<p>Free lunch, flexible hours, one of the biggest arcades in Manhattan (3 cabinets!), competitive salary and full benefits (health, dental, vision), take-what-you-want vacation.<p>Our office is in Union Square, Manhattan. If you don't live in New York City, we'll pay to fix that.<p>Shoot an email to jobs@canv.as with a resume, a link to your github, webpage, etc. and tell us about something cool you've built.","time":1343839099,"type":"comment"}
