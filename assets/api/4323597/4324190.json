We make getting informed and participating in politics easier by tailoring content to our users based on their worldviews and where they live. Through our unique matching mechanism, users get to find out where they stand in relation to the political world and are matched to the politicians/causes they want to get involved in. Check out our beta at www.lovegov.com. We are going live in September.<p>Our mission is to develop tools that facilitate democracy. We are committed to non-partisanship, government transparency and the right to individual privacy. Our vision is to build a platform that makes politics accessible to every single citizen of the world, from a local to a federal level. We believe in the vision of Democracy 2.0 and digital governance.
