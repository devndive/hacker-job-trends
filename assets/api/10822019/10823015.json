If you know a software engineer who fits, please direct them to jobs@phylagen.com.<p>We are an energized team developing microbiome data analytic tools and bioinformatics pipelines that are being applied to a wide range of environments. We plan to bring on an innovative coder - with a B.S. or M.S in computer science, engineering, statistics, or bioinformatics (translating to 4-5 years software engineering experience). We want someone deeply knowledgeable in algorithm optimization, including parallelization, distributed execution and implementing methods. The position will entail combining code and data from different disciplines, translating and optimizing published research algorithms (e.g. created in R&#x2F;Python&#x2F;Julia) into industry products, and creating reference databases that can be used in machine learning applications. Expertise in the analysis of metagenomics data and bioinformatics pipelines is a bonus. We are looking someone who is flexible - a fast learner with relevant experience that will allow them to contribute quickly. You will be a key player in a cutting edge, rapidly growing venture-backed microbiome startup.<p>Phylagen harnesses the vast, unseen world of microbes to improve our daily lives. The microbiome - the trillions of interacting bacteria, fungi, algae and viruses that inhabit every inch of our world - is the most complex, untapped dataset on earth. We combine advanced DNA sequencing and bioinformatic analytics with scalable, high performance computing to analyze the microbiome in ways previously not possible. This enables us to determine and interpret complex genetic signatures and provide a powerful new decision-making tool for businesses.","time":1451676958,"type":"comment"}
