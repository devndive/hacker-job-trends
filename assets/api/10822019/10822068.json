Their algorithms run on our proprietary execution platform which interfaces with a large variety of bookmakers and exchanges, enabling access to the best prices and massive liquidity.<p>Our distributed, concurrent system has a core written in Erlang, which interacts with a wide variety of Python processes across the rest of the business. There are also smaller projects written in C++, Go, Julia, and JavaScript.<p>We have a very flat hierarchy and an emphasis on developer freedom. We encourage people to work on areas of the code base that interest them, because we believe developers are happiest and most productive when intellectually stimulated.<p>We are looking for developers who have solid fundamentals in programming and maths and an ability to pick up new technologies. You don&#x27;t need to be interested in sports or betting.<p>If this appeals to you, please email info@gambitresearch.com","time":1451661843,"type":"comment"}
