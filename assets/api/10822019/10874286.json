What you really do is breathe life into interfaces that millions of people use every day. You get the details right. You make computing enjoyable, an experience which is too often the opposite.<p>We have a ton of interesting work to do and you&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to find a team that cares more about making great products, or an environment more amicable to this kind of work. Come focus on perfecting your craft in a place where the CEO cares as much about it as you do.<p>We don&#x27;t really care where you went to school, job title buzzwords, or any of that. This is a position where a portfolio speaks louder than any credentials. We want to see your work!<p>(Note: this is _not_ a design position. We&#x27;re evaluating the quality of the implementation, though of course it&#x27;s impossible to entirely separate the two - like writing&#x2F;acting).<p>We&#x27;d also like to hear more about the projects you&#x27;ve worked on, what your role was, what went right&#x2F;wrong, etc... We&#x27;re looking for real experience.<p>Remote is absolutely OK, though we do have some bias towards local candidates. (Boulder&#x2F;Denver area)<p>To apply, email jobs@rafflecopter.com or me personally at jr@rafflecopter.com<p>Permalink: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rafflecopter.com&#x2F;workhere-html-css\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rafflecopter.com&#x2F;workhere-html-css</a>","time":1452403082,"type":"comment"}
