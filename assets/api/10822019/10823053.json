Think Kickstarter for court cases - or Change.org with hard legal outcomes - we&#x27;ve funded cases ranging from Supreme Court interventions to local communities trying to prevent developers destroying their green spaces. Our MVP has raised nearly $400k for exciting cases from a standing start in a few months and we are building a team to grow nationally in the UK and internationally.<p>What that means on the product front is developing a world class webapp (mainly written in Django) that has huge scope for helping users interface with cases, social issues and other donors. Engineers with a keen interest in user funnels and metrics (&amp;, um, social justice) please get in touch! <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crowdjustice.co.uk&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crowdjustice.co.uk&#x2F;jobs</a> or email julia@crowdjustice.co.uk","time":1451677488,"type":"comment"}
