We&#x27;re primarily backend engineers and computer scientists (ex. Google &amp; Facebook) and have developed a set of state of the art algorithms for language-agnostic static code analysis. We built an MVP around it which we quietly launched (supporting Ruby and Go for now) but we badly need help with frontend magic.<p>YOU are proficient with JavaScript and are comfortable with different frontend frameworks. Our current frontend is built using Marionette and Backbone so we&#x27;d like you to be able to jump right in. In the long run however we would like you to cleanly rewrite the frontend using the technology of your choice. Our primary working language is English and so we require working proficiency.<p>We are a startup but we&#x27;re fully funded and we can ensure that the successful candidate is happy with their renumeration and benefits package. International candidates with EU work permit are more than welcome provided they&#x27;re willing to move to Poland.<p>If this sounds interesting please kindly send me your resume to marcinw[at]codebeat[dot]co.","time":1451670314,"type":"comment"}
