This business was started in 2010 as an experiment in providing an easy-to-use, online option for booking a service required by countless households every day, which otherwise tends to require phone calls, giving directions, and the like.<p>Since the founders are presently pursuing other opportunities, an opportunity now exists for someone interested in joining, or even taking over, our business on mutually agreeable terms. Our technology stack is a Clojure + jQuery app running on Google App Engine, so any relevant web development experience would be an advantage.<p>admin@singapore-aircon.com","time":1451667628,"type":"comment"}
