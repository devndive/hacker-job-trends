We are looking for very experienced developers familiar with the Java platform. On your daily work you will have to deal with frameworks like Hibernate, Spring, Jersey, and so forth. Familiarity with concurrency patterns is a big advantage too. So is experience with JVM debugging, GC analysis, profiling, etc. Additional languages are also a big plus and VoIP experience is even better but not mandatory.<p>For all positions you can apply from the link above.
