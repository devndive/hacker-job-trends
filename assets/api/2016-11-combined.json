Because the most clinically complicated cases in a patient population tend to drive a majority of the costs, even seemingly small improvements in these patients’ well-being have dramatic benefits for the care provider. Wellframe focuses on improving patient health by providing personalized and adaptive care programs for people trying to recover from or manage serious health problems. We use the health data we collect in order to intelligently allot care resources to the specific needs of patients, paying special attention to the most-critical patients. Through clinical studies and working with large healthcare payers, we have seen that our platform improves patient outcomes, increases the capacity of care management teams and reduces costs of the care provider.<p>We have a relatively small engineering team at about 10 engineers. What makes us unique is that we have a full time clinical team of doctors that work with us to break down clinical science so that we can build it back up into personalized and adaptive care programs. We&#x27;re currently looking for several mid&#x2F;senior engineering positions (android, iOS, frontend, infra&#x2F;platform, sre) across our engineering team.

The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.<p>- The reproducibility crisis. It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the scientific literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis&quot;<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 14 million pdfs to Academia.edu, and upload about 1 million a month. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to reproducibility, we think the way to solve the reproducibility crisis is to build a new peer review system that (a) crowd-sources peer review from the academic community and (b) provides credit to material that journals don&#x27;t publish (data-sets, code, replications, failed replications).<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (a) and (b). We realize that addressing reproducibility is a huge challenge. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us.

It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after four years, half of all schools in the US (65,000 schools) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of 120 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Node and React.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.

We aim to fly a full-size prototype before the end of 2017, and to have a productizable demonstrator by 2020.<p>We seek to help enable truly vertical cities by opening up urban airways in a predictable and controlled manner. We believe that full automation will allow us to achieve higher safety by minimizing human error. Our aircraft will follow predetermined flight paths, with only minor deviations if obstacle avoidance is needed. We believe this mode of operation will be compatible with future airspace management systems and will allow more aircraft to share the sky. Full automation also enables us to make our aircraft as small and light as possible, and will significantly reduce manufacturing costs.<p>We’re always looking for talent and for development partners.

Noone? There&#x27;s a reason for it. Because we switch jobs every two years, for a company it&#x27;s very hard to justify spending money on training people. But they do want everyone to be on top of the latest and greatest in tech. And we do.<p>Because we devs like learning, we spend our evenings and weekends learning new technologies. Something the company we work for benefits from (that is, they get the knowledge on the lastest tech without having to spend money on training).<p>This is unfair. But this is how the world works.<p>Companies don&#x27;t have budgets for training (or have say 500eur&#x2F;person&#x2F;year)... this is scary because the fast-changing tech world will leave you behind unless you spend time improving yourself. If the company doesn&#x27;t spend money on training, then you have to find ways to catch up, probably over weekends and evenings. But companies do have big budgets for recruiting. Everyone assumes that you have to spend money to get good guys, and recruiters charge a good chunk of the first year salary for the hire. Companies budget for this.<p>We want to get around the fact that there&#x27;s no budget for training, by taking it from where businesses do have a budget: hiring. So it&#x27;s mostly budget relocation. But there&#x27;s a clear benefit for the company: they get training &#x27;for free.&#x27; And they get onboarding partially solved. It&#x27;s common to hire someone, and the assume that the first month is wasted, with the person getting used to the tech stack the company uses.

Your work will typically initiate person-months of security improvements in products millions of people use.

We&#x27;re also starting the process of re-imagining our main WWW Front-end stack with a migration to Redux.<p>1) Data Engineering(s) -- We have a ton of different technologies that our data engineers work with, and they are a really strong core team here. Kafka, PostgreSQL, Docker, Mesos, Marathon, Chronos, nginx, and so many more technologies.<p>2) Product Security Engineer -- We have a lot of applications and need more talented software engineers who love to break and fix. We need hands on engineers who are not afraid to dive in and drive fixes to completion, and evangelize security.<p>3) Systems Engineer (Austin) -- We are hiring systems engineers at all of our offices, but our Austin office is growing very quickly.

page)<p>We need super smart engineers from all levels to help us build one of the best engineered e-commerce platform in the world (big talk we know, but that is our goal!). Our engineers combine creativity, curiosity, and drive to continuously perfect and revolutionize Jet from the inside out. We are looking to bring more intellectually curious engineers who are passionate about technology in general (Jet is a technology first company and prides itself on its culture of learning and knowledge sharing and we want all our engineers to be as passionate as we are!)<p>Our platform is largely an event driven platform implemented via a microservice architecture. The platform runs on Microsoft Azure and uses a large number of technologies and middle ware. The bulk of backend code is written in a functional style (F#) and our system of record is an event sourced system (essentially a log of all actions on the platform). We use a mix of Kafka, Redis, Elastic Search, Azure SQL, Event Store and Azure Storage for our data stores. About 50% of the platform runs on Linux and the rest Windows (although we move into more containerization we will see a shift towards Linux).<p>----------<p>I&#x27;ve been working at Jet since mid-February, and I can honestly say this is the best job I&#x27;ve ever had. It personally checks off every single box I could have a for a dream job:<p>- Incredible growth. We were the fastest startup to hit a billion dollar valuation, and we just got bought by Walmart for 3.3 billion. With the Fortune 1 at our backs there are some really amazing opportunities and projects that are just getting started.<p>- Functional programming in F#. Never been more productive coding. And in general we have a very modern tech stack that is a pleasure to work with.<p>- Tech talks and workshops all the time. I&#x27;m learning more than I ever have.<p>- Extremely competent management. It feels like they really care about employees&#x27; happiness here, we&#x27;ve got experienced people at the helm, and it is amazing to see what a company can look like when you have a fantastic management team bringing their A-game. Really, it&#x27;s incredible to have to try hard to find something to complain about.<p>- All the trappings of modern startup life. Free gym membership, lots of free food, etc.<p>We&#x27;re hiring people of all different types of experience for all different types of roles.

While DNA sequencing technology has advanced rapidly, it’s still at a level equivalent to what assembly language was to computing. With huge advances yet to be made, we&#x27;re creating products that will do for sequencing what C did for computing which enable scientists to gain higher-order clarity and meaning to what is now very low-level information. Software is a key part of that leap. There&#x27;s no shortage of difficult problems due to the scale and complexity of analyzing, managing, and visualizing sequencing data. Thoughtful and elegant software engineering can yield big payoffs.<p>Our software and instruments are used at top research institutions and hospitals around the world. 10x Genomics has most recently raised a $55M Series C from Fidelity and SoftBank and has about 130 employees in Pleasanton, San Francisco, and in the field across the world.<p>You can view a demo of an existing piece of visualization software at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;loupe.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;loupe&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;loupe.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;loupe&#x2F;</a>, or read about (and run if you&#x27;d like) our massively parallel pipelines at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;software.10xgenomics.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;software.10xgenomics.com</a>.

I never taught doctor oluku could ever get my HIV-AIDS cured with his healing spell, i have tried almost everything but I couldn&#x27;t find any solution on my disease, despite all these happening to me, i always spend a lot to buy a HIV drugs from hospital and taking some several medications but no relieve, until one day i was just browsing on the internet when i came across a great post of !Michelle! who truly said that she was been diagnose with HIV and was healed that very week through the help of this great powerful healing spell doctor ,I wonder why he is called the great papa oluku, i never knew it was all because of the great and perfect work that he has been doing that is causing all this. so I quickly contacted him, and he ask me some few questions and so i did all the things he asked me to do, He never collected any money from me until I was finally cured, only to see that at the very day which he said i will be healed, all the strength that has left me before rush back and i becomes very strong and healthy, this disease almost kills my life all because of me, so i went to hospital to give the final test to the disease and the doctor said i am HIV negative, i am very amazed and happy about the healing doctor oluku gave to me from the ancient part of Africa, you can email him now for your own healing too on his email: drolukuspellhome@gmail.com thank you doctor for healing me.","time":1478496809,"type":"comment"},{"by":"ibash","id":12851581,"parent":12846216,"text":"Hi!","time":1478049512,"type":"comment"},{"deleted":true,"id":12859414,"parent":12846216,"time":1478121770,"type":"comment"},{"by":"samstave","id":12850284,"parent":12846216,"text":"Is anyone amenable to hiring a devOps team, rather than an individual?<p>Email me at sstave ~at~ provisioned.io","time":1478036578,"type":"comment"},{"by":"maxmind","id":12847193,"kids":[12876726,12847497],"parent":12846216,"text":"SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR AT MAXMIND &#x2F; WALTHAM, MA &#x2F; REMOTE &#x2F; FULL TIME &#x2F; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.maxmind.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;home\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.maxmind.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;home</a><p>To view the job description and apply please click on the link here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;maxmind&#x2F;bf978fb8-7340-4c9e-85a1-b354d7ac4217\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;maxmind&#x2F;bf978fb8-7340-4c9e-85a1-b354d7...</a><p>MaxMind does not currently sponsor employment visas.<p>RESUMES WITHOUT COVER LETTERS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.
