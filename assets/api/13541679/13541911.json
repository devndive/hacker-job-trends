As a DevOps Engineer on the Core Services team, you&#x27;ll work with me to build and manage the systems that run Atmosphere (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cyverse.org&#x2F;atmosphere\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cyverse.org&#x2F;atmosphere</a>) -- think &quot;virtual Linux workstations for research scientists&quot;. Some technologies you&#x27;ll work with are GNU+Linux, OpenStack, Ansible, and Python. Our web application is written in Django and React.<p>We also support one of the world&#x27;s largest iRODS deployments (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;irods.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;irods.org</a>), and are in the early stages of implementing Ceph for block storage. We have an exciting feature roadmap for the next year, and need a strong generalist sysadmin&#x2F;developer to help us deliver valuable tools to our community.<p>Everything that we build is released to the world under a BSD license -- look up our GitHub orgs (cyverse, iplantcollaborativeopensource, and cyverse-ansible). We sit next to a team of science analysts and have plenty of opportunities to help our users get the most from our services. We work in a beautiful, modern building at the University of Arizona (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bio5.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bio5.org&#x2F;</a>). As university employees we have great benefits and work-life balance. Tucson is a wonderfully livable Southwestern city with a growing tech&#x2F;software&#x2F;research community and plenty of things to do outside.","time":1485965806,"type":"comment"}
