We&#x27;re still small (7 full-time engineers and a few contractors, ~20 total), and the music recording and hi-fi industries are already beating a path to our door, so we need all-rounders to keep up. If you like the idea of hacking on our (C++) encoder&#x2F;decoder, learning assembly for a new instruction set to optimise porting to a new hardware platform, then spending the next week helping us analyse, process and revitalise the back catalogs of the world&#x27;s top record labels...we want to hear from you. DSP experience not required (although obviously it&#x27;s nice!).<p>MQA has developed a music encoding and delivery system whose quality blows basically anything commercially available out of the water. (Think it&#x27;s impossible to improve on CD? So did a lot of people. If you want to help out with the peer-reviewed double-blind studies that proved them wrong, here&#x27;s the place to do it.) MQA is an end-to-end system, that ensures precise transmission of the analog signal from the mastering desk to the listener&#x27;s ears. We&#x27;ve signed with household-name record labels, artists and hi-fi manufacturers, we&#x27;ve got music-industry luminaries working here (they&#x27;re remarkably nice), and it&#x27;s only getting bigger from here. We&#x27;re a friendly, international team that values initiative and getting things done, and we&#x27;re looking forward to meeting you. Interviews are a phone screen then on-site with the team.<p>Email: jobs [at] mqa.co.uk","time":1485971438,"type":"comment"}
