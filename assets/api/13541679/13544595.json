We&#x27;re launching a few new products soon that I&#x27;m excited about. I love working here as an engineer. It&#x27;s a great balance of challenge, freedom, and impact.<p>We&#x27;ve been growing quickly and we&#x27;re looking to hire an Operations (DevOps) engineer! As background, we had a manually configured AWS infrastructure that we&#x27;ve retired in favor of an Ansible &#x2F; Terraform-based setup. We&#x27;ve automated infrastructure and our deploy process so it&#x27;s a great time to come in and shape where we go from here.<p>We also have positions open for a Principal Front-End Engineer (Ember.js &#x2F; Node) and a Data Analyst on our careers page at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;chownow?lever-via=MO5-ac-qvc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;chownow?lever-via=MO5-ac-qvc</a>.<p>If you&#x27;re interested or have questions what it&#x27;s like to work here, please contact me at kevinlondon@chownow.com or our recruiter, Candice, at candice@chownow.com.","time":1485979910,"type":"comment"}
