Whether someone needs a handyman, house cleaner, mover or delivery person, TaskRabbit delights clients by matching the right skilled person in minutes. On the other side of the marketplace we help our Taskers earn a living by setting their own prices, defining their working hours, and give them control to help people when and how they want in the most supportive marketplace.<p>As a Staff Engineer you&#x27;d be one of the leaders of the team, helping to mentor junior engineers, propose creative solutions, and detangle the complex into the simple. This role will be primarily responsible for driving the backend development. You&#x27;ll work alongside our Chief Architect to have a full vision of the system working to build a robust platform that&#x27;s clearly organized and easy to maintain. We believe strongly in test-driven development,  code reviews, and collaboration. It&#x27;s expected that you&#x27;d be a main reviewer helping to grow the skills of the more junior engineers, along the way hopefully you&#x27;ll learn a thing or two during the reviews as well. You&#x27;ll also spend significant time writing code and building features; and we&#x27;re looking for someone who will be as excited to learn engineering insights from us as they are to teach us the gems of wisdom they&#x27;ve learned along the way.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;o2et631\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;o2et631</a>","time":1485970609,"type":"comment"}
