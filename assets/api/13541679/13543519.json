React-Native is easy to teach, so if you have no React-Native experience yet, but you&#x27;re excited to learn something new, we&#x27;d love to chat with you too. We&#x27;re looking for strong generalists and great teammates to help change the future of education.<p>Android and Java experience is essential for this role.  We&#x27;re happy to train anyone without React-Native experience at all, but we want to make sure we&#x27;re working with someone who has existing experience developing on Android.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;classdojo&#x2F;72442c2b-be83-47c6-8fdc-aec0e9096e29\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;classdojo&#x2F;72442c2b-be83-47c6-8fdc-aec0...</a>","time":1485974349,"type":"comment"}
