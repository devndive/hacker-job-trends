We offer the equity, influence, and fun of an early-stage company, with stability, great pay, and a low-stress culture. We have great backers, amazing traction (50x growth in the last two years), and an 11-digit target market. I&#x27;ve built half a dozen startups, including Writely (aka Google Docs), and I can honestly say this is my favorite so far.<p>Frontend Engineer: we earn our keep by giving users unprecedentedly fast and easy tools for exploring vast amounts of operational data. That starts with our unique backend query engine, but it doesn&#x27;t mean anything without an equally amazing frontend. We&#x27;re building a brand-new web app that adds features while removing complexity, all with an eye to performance. As a ground-up rewrite, there&#x27;s lots of opportunity for you to have a significant impact. If you care about user experience, enjoy great engineering, and want to join an experienced team where you can really stretch yourself, we&#x27;d love to hear from you.<p>&quot;Agent Engineer&quot; sounds like something from Person Of Interest, but actually you&#x27;ll own our lean, mean data collection agent. An ops visibility tool is only as good as the data it collects, and we pride ourselves on gathering everything from logs to system metrics to application metrics to API data. If you enjoy constantly getting to play with new tools, come help us connect to... everything. You&#x27;ll get to play with packages from Apache to Zookeeper, APIs from AWS to, er, Azure, while tackling challenges such as monitoring 100,000+ simultaneous log files using minimal CPU.<p>If this sounds like fun, check out the links below, or drop us a line at jobs@scalyr.com!<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scalyr.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;front-end-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scalyr.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;front-end-engineer</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scalyr.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;agent-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scalyr.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;agent-engineer</a>","time":1485970476,"type":"comment"}
