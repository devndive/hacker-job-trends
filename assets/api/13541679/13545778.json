Because both Google and your competitors are always changing, the only way to succeed in the long-run is with software.<p>We&#x27;ve built a CDN that enables our software to modify HTML and run A&#x2F;B testing experiments for SEO across groups of pages. Experiments typically take 14-21 days for Google to index and react to changes, and we use Bayesian Time Series models to determine the statistical significance of our experiments.<p>E-mail founders@rankscience.com with any interest.","time":1485986587,"type":"comment"}
