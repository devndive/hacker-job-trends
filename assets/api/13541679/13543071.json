We believe in empowerment through autonomy. We employ a services oriented platform[4] primarily utilizing Rails on the back-end and React on the front-end. Every new Engineer delivers code from day one.<p>We&#x27;re specifically looking for talented Engineers with strong architectural pattern knowledge (Fowler is your preferred bedtime reading). You&#x27;re familiar with the concerns of MVC, perhaps with the Redux pattern. You&#x27;ve used Backbone to create front end frameworks, can talk web standards and best practices. You know why accessibility is important, and have a desire to learn about building secure applications. You can debate for hours on microservice vs monolithic applications and can sniff out code smell and recognize anti-patterns from a mile away.<p>Here at Grand Rounds we are literally saving lives through our technology and services, it&#x27;s rewarding work.
