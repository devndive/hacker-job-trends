It&#x27;s what&#x27;s perhaps most broken about banks - the FT recently said that they are spending $270B&#x2F;year on compliance! - and we&#x27;re helping to fix it. Our customers are tier-1 financial institutions and large multinationals.<p>At the moment we&#x27;re looking for generalist engineers of any experience level. We work in Python, Go, Java and JavaScript. We have two projects with over 1k stars on GitHub (one just broke 3k <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arachnys\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arachnys</a>). We&#x27;re always looking to open source more.<p>Our small, tight-knit team has a can-do mentality and isn&#x27;t scared to use new tools when they are the right ones for the job. We have a relentless focus on quality of delivery, while not being scared of pushing back on customer demands. (A tier-1 bank recently told us that we were the first supplier that had asked them, &quot;Why?&quot;, about their requirements.)<p>Drop me a line (email in profile) if any questions.<p>Email jobs@arachnys.com to apply, linking to your GitHub or some other code that you think tells a good story about you.","time":1485965875,"type":"comment"}
