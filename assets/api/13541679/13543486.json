We value personal development; we hire curious, highly-motivated individuals who look to grow in areas where they have not yet achieved mastery.<p>Our impact is greater than just publishing research papers. We build working systems. We try to empower and strengthen the AI research community, and collaborate freely. We publish our techniques, tools, and methods, and try to find creative approaches for how to improve the progress and impact of ML research.<p>We&#x27;re currently hiring software engineers, machine learning researchers, machine learning interns, and a recruiting coordinator.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a>","time":1485974164,"type":"comment"}
