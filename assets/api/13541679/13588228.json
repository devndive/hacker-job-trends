Weâ€™re committed to solving actual cross platform app design and development problems with tools that simplifies working with layout, interaction and motion.<p>In order to do this, we&#x27;ve implemented our own OpenGL engine that targets multiple platforms. We&#x27;ve also developed a superset of C# called [Uno](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fusetools.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;uno&#x2F;uno-lang\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fusetools.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;uno&#x2F;uno-lang</a>), with built in support for foreign code written in Objective-C, C++, and Java in order to help target multiple platforms from a single codebase.<p>We&#x27;re currently hiring people for several roles, as we have just secured $12 millon in funding from NorthZone and Alliance Venture. We currently have around 25 developers on our team and, as we grow, we&#x27;re also looking for people who can help us manage that growth. If you have expertise in different approaches, we would love to hear them.<p>We want people who like to think about API + library design, since the tools we make here are used by developers all over the world. Almost everyone on our team has a developer background, and we follow a strong practice of eating our own dog food. If you work on Fuse, you&#x27;ll be using Fuse. Our community gets close support from us, the developers, so you must be good at communicating through Slack and at workshops. We&#x27;re looking for people who like to help other people.<p>For more information please reach out to us on Slack [here](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fusecommunity.slack.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fusecommunity.slack.com</a>).
