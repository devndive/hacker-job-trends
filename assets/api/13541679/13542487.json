We believe software is not only eating the world, it’s eating finance, and we’re feeding the beast. We’re building, from the ground up, a technology-driven trading platform for the coveted commercial real estate asset class, previously only accessible to the largest institutional investors.<p>Because we’re passionate about opening access to this historically exclusive marketplace to an ever broader group of participants, we’re relentlessly building an experience so intuitive and efficient individuals and institutions alike are empowered to invest. With technology as our core engine, we’re also engineering machine learning and data science strategies to accelerate discovery and vet better assets, faster.<p>We have raised roughly $70 million to date, from outstanding venture investors including Khosla Ventures, Thrive Capital, General Catalyst, Founders Fund, and Goldman Sachs.<p>Full Stack Engineer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cadre.com&#x2F;careers?gh_jid=554376\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cadre.com&#x2F;careers?gh_jid=554376</a> Senior Full Stack Engineer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cadre.com&#x2F;careers?gh_jid=75123\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cadre.com&#x2F;careers?gh_jid=75123</a>\nSite Reliability Engineer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cadre.com&#x2F;careers?gh_jid=460998\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cadre.com&#x2F;careers?gh_jid=460998</a>\nSoftware Engineer in Test: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cadre.com&#x2F;careers?gh_jid=155526\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cadre.com&#x2F;careers?gh_jid=155526</a>","time":1485968823,"type":"comment"}
