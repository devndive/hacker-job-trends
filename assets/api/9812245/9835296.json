Pageload is based in Sydney, Australia but has a global customer base and aims to be a global service when publicly launched. Pageload recenly aquired venture captial to accelerate the global rollout. We strongly believe that everyone who wants to work with us does it because it&#x27;s an area they like to spend time in, be it jpeg headers or shaving cpu cycles off css minifacation. We don&#x27;t have requirements as to when or from where you work -- that&#x27;s most often best decided by yourself.<p>Our platform is [at the moment] built with nodejs.\nWe are (currently) looking for one position:<p>- nodejs developer: your main job will be to expand the functionality of pageload in terms of what we can optimise (for size or speed) as well as generally improving the application, its resiliency and infrastructure. A strong background in javascript&#x2F;nodejs as well as experience with C is preferred since that&#x27;s where you will do most of your work (unless you can convince the team there&#x27;s a better tool for the job). Experience with Amazon infrastructure is also a plus.<p>Feel free to shoot us an email to [jobs at pageload.io] or ping me on IRC (jbergstroem@freenode) if you&#x27;d like to talk. Looking forward to hearing from you.","time":1436134965,"type":"comment"}
