We provide sophisticated software and robust analytics to elevate quality of care for cancer patients. Our organizational strategy, capabilities and resources are unified around a deep commitment to quality and value in oncology, and the goal of reducing the physical and financial burden of cancer treatment and survivor-ship. We are looking for others to join our team where you can start to deliver an immediate impact to the healthcare of others suffering from cancer.<p>For all positions we value skill-set over tool-set and ability over qualifications.  The team you’re joining is  small, highly skilled, and reasonably good at ping pong. Our offices are relaxed, kitchen is well-stocked, and we have fluffy dogs on site.<p>* Network Admin&#x2F;DevOps - We are looking for relentless problem-solvers to join our DevOps team. You will help us predict the future, figure out when we need new stuff before we need it. Attention to uptimes and familiarity with monitoring concepts. You will talk to the team, and you’ll work closely with others within the company to bring projects from planning to launch.<p>* Front-end Developer - Someone focused on delivering products with a great UX. Experience building fat JS MVC apps, designing complex stateful apps in a maintainable way, with data visualization using D3 or Processing.  Knowledgeable of HTML5, ES6, CSS3, and Web standards are important.  You should be able to rapidly prototype features and designs.<p>* Back-end Developer - Experienced developers, who have worked on a decent number of products, have a propensity for shipping often, probably with years of experience and amazing coding chops (those having left coding behind them—this isn&#x27;t the company for you, unfortunately).  If you are a polyglot thinker&#x2F;Functional language lover then you earn bonus points.  You should be eager to learn&#x2F;teach other on the team about TDD, continuous integration, and functional paradigms.<p>Shoot any questions or apply by emailing nathan@radialogica.com","time":1435805571,"type":"comment"}
