Challenges we&#x27;re working on: efficient mesh compression for smooth VR performance, novel VR user interfaces, data analytics of user interactions in VR, and finally making the development of VR experiences as accessible as possible to anyone who can generate 3D content.<p>-- What We&#x27;re Looking For --<p>We are hiring engineers in NYC to help build the future of our platform. At InsiteVR, weâ€™re always pushing the limits of computing power, especially mobile devices, to render highly complex architectural models in VR. Before we can even walk around and experience these models in VR they have to be processed and optimized for rendering. We are hiring a full stack web developer and 3D Graphics Engineer to lead our development efforts.<p>Full stack: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;insitevr-1&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;70786-full-stack-dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;insitevr-1&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;70786-full-stack-dev</a><p>3D Graphics Engineer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;insitevr-1&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;70779-3d-graphics-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;insitevr-1&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;70779-3d-graphics-engineer</a><p>You can also just email me at angel[at]insitevr.com","time":1435776815,"type":"comment"}
