REMOTE ok. Hourly.<p>At InterviewKickstart, we conduct a rigorous bootcamp to prepare for technical interviews at small and big career-launching tech companies. It is my passion business i.e. it&#x27;s not making a ton of money. I was a very early engineer at Box and most recently their Director of Engineering before I quit to do this full-time. I&#x27;ve done an obscene amount of interviewing and hiring in my career.<p>Grading homework assignments thoroughly is a commitment of ~10 hours a week. You must have a solid CS background, and be able to read and understand multiple programming languages (at last Java, C++ and Python). Interviews for this position will consist of a coding test of small problems covering a breadth of CS topics. You should also have some sort of a passion for this kind of work of helping people with accountability. I will pay quite well to the right candidate.<p>If this piques your interest, then please send me an email: soham@interviewkickstart.com.","time":1435773618,"type":"comment"}
