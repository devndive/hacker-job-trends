In short, we crunch a huge amount of data for TV networks, movie studios &amp; etc to give them meaningful viewership statistics.  We&#x27;ve been around for 25+ years, and we&#x27;ve necessarily changed a lot in that time (we started out contracting with video rental stores).  We&#x27;re certainly not a startup, but we have a comfortable culture and a strong OSS focus.<p>We&#x27;re hiring mid and senior system administrators and DevOps engineers.  We&#x27;re looking for experience with the following:<p>* Linux (mostly CentOS)<p>* Configuration management (especially Puppet)<p>* Large-scale database management (Postgres)<p>* AWS, VMware &amp; virtualization tools<p>* Storage infrastructure (NetApp, etc)<p>* Monitoring tools<p>* Python and Ruby for DevOps; also a plus for other positions.<p>* We have at least one opening for a Windows admin, too.<p>We&#x27;re also looking for software engineers at all levels.  Our existing infrastructure is generally in C++ and Perl, and new products are generally in Python or Ruby.  Our focus is on handling massive data sets.  Big data &amp; MapReduce technologies, OLAP, large-scale SQL-based DBs, and distributed system experience would all be great.<p>Feel free to contact &quot;colin.hyzy at rentrakmail.com&quot; for more information.
