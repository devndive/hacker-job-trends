We’re currently in the process of migrating our front end codebase from a Perl stack (Perl, Dancer, and jQuery UI) over to a modern stack (Node.js, Express, and React). To move between technology stacks without user impact, we use server-side rendering to convert isomorphic React components into static markup that are then served by our legacy app server. We’re looking for team members who know that speed is survival and value quality in building a great product.<p>Tilt is the fastest growing company in the crowdfunding space. Launching out of Y-Combinator three years ago, we’re launching more crowdfunding campaigns per day than any other platform in the world by focusing on what crowdfunding will look like in a mobile world. Tilt has raised over $70 million in funding from Andreessen Horowitz, SV Angel, Y-Combinator, and others.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tilt.com&#x2F;learn&#x2F;jobs?gh_jid=8116\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tilt.com&#x2F;learn&#x2F;jobs?gh_jid=8116</a>","time":1435765816,"type":"comment"}
