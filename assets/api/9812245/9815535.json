Basically, we work with the massive amount of location-based data sources out there to help businesses find the best place to open a new location.<p>We&#x27;re a young startup (less than a year old), but now that we have seed funding, we&#x27;re looking to scale up our business. We&#x27;d like to handle a huge number of data sources, with a huge number of models processing them, providing value to a huge number of businesses. Since we&#x27;re so early in our development, there&#x27;s a lot of room to help us work out the architecture, and make a big impact in how our business works.<p>Most importantly, we are looking for general software engineering skills. You should be able to dive into any problem and understand the interactions between all the different parts of it. You should be able to write clean, maintainable, modular code.\nThat said, we are looking for somebody who can:<p>* Code in Python (preferably including NumPy&#x2F;SciPy&#x2F;Pandas&#x2F;Scikit-learn)<p>* Work with &quot;messy&quot; data--scraping websites, working with CSV&#x2F;JSON&#x2F;REST APIs, automating cleanup tasks, etc.<p>* Interact with databases (we use Postgres&#x2F;PostGIS&#x2F;Mongo, and more are on the horizon)<p>* Do some basic sysadmin-type work, including working with Linux, EC2, Docker<p>If you don&#x27;t know all of these, (or even if you do!), show us that you can learn quickly. Or even show us what we can use that&#x27;s better!<p>Send us an email at work@idealspot.com if you&#x27;re interested.
