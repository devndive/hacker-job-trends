We quantify the movement of modern cities, at scale.<p>We ingest any kind of video to analyze pedestrian and vehicular movement, revealing hidden patterns and strategic opportunities. We use proprietary computer vision technology to gather data from live streams and archival video. We take privacy very seriously, designing our systems to yield useful data without identity detection.<p>We are looking for:<p>* Embedded Software Engineer (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;4uypew\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;4uypew</a>): We recently announced our custom sensor which is designed to attach easily to a window and runs proprietary Placemeter algorithms to extract data from the scene outside the window. As part of a small team you will be involved in all aspects of developing the current and future versions of the sensor. Looking for mid-level to senior engineers, 2+ years of experience with embedded&#x2F;small devices.<p>* Data Production Engineer (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;1t3reu\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;1t3reu</a>): As a member of the Computer Vision team you will be the crucial link between algorithm development and production data delivery. You will analyze data produced by our algorithms from real-world video, evaluate its quality, identify problems and work on solutions together with Computer Vision engineers. You&#x27;ll also manage our large QA video database against which we test any code changes. Ideal for a recent grad who wants to gain more experience in Computer Vision.","time":1435779298,"type":"comment"}
