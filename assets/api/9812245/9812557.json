The financial markets are full of noisy and unreliable data sources, drawn from nonstationary distributions, with widely-varying time scales.  We&#x27;re building a new internal infrastructure for this hostile environment.  Our system needs to manage heterogeneous vector-valued time series and machine learning models for both our research process and production trading operations.<p>You would be the Lead Infrastructure Engineer - doing core architecture and development work, with the expectation that you&#x27;ll grow a team down the road.  Experience with time-series data management and cloud is a huge plus.  Primary languages are currently Python and Matlab, with some R, but if you think e.g. Scala, Julia, or Go is the right tool for the job, we&#x27;re open-minded and can work with anything.
