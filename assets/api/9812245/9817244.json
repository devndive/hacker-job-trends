The goal: put all newspapers and magazines in the country behind one (quite sexy) paywall, and make it so easy to use that young people start paying for journalism again.<p>Right now we&#x27;re focusing on scaling internationally. We use Ruby, Node.js, Redis, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, Ansible, Sinatra, Clojure, React and more Ruby.
