The NFL properties see hundreds of millions of users worldwide and its mobile applications are installed on tens of millions of devices.<p>We are primarily hiring iOS, Android, Web and Backend engineers (with a bit of a lean to people with an interest in full stack development). Currently we are building (and rebuilding) a lot of our core architecture. Our new iOS app is written entirely in Swift, our Android application using RxAndroid and our new web platform is based on React.js. On the backend we are in the middle of rebuilding many of our services experimenting with different technologies generally with an eye on immutable data and functional programming.<p>If you are interested, please email me at todd.berman@nfl.com","time":1435777790,"type":"comment"}
