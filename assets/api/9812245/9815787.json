It&#x27;s also one of the fastest growing SAAS businesses in history! Companies who join Zenefits are able to consolidate their many HR systems into one easy-to-use place, the Zenefits dashboard, where they can also secure and manage benefits for their employees. Zenefits the product is fast moving, and the engineering team is growing fast! There&#x27;s still a lot of work to be done, and the projects we work on are high-impact projects with a tangible effect on the business. I haven&#x27;t been here long, but so far it&#x27;s clear that the perks are great, the people are of the highest quality, and there&#x27;s a great culture of transparency and shared ownership. Experience with Python&#x2F;Django and Ember.js are by no means necessary, but certainly won&#x27;t hurt.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;secure.zenefits.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;57437?gh_jid=57437&amp;gh_src=b7jrop\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;secure.zenefits.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;57437?gh_jid=57437&amp;gh_src=b...</a>","time":1435791017,"type":"comment"}
