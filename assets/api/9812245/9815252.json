There are two positions for hackers at the department of biochemistry (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nki.nl&#x2F;divisions&#x2F;biochemistry&#x2F;perrakis-a-group&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nki.nl&#x2F;divisions&#x2F;biochemistry&#x2F;perrakis-a-group&#x2F;</a>)<p>Scientific programmer - improve and extend crystallography software that computes structure from X-ray images. Expert knowledge of C++ is not necessary, major extension can be done in your language of choice but the current code base is in C++. If you understand the science or algorithms behind it is a huge plus.<p>Java web developer - develop full stack web application to serve as a front end for a successful protein structure refinement package. Maintain a java applet that helps in protein crystallization trials.<p>Open and inquisitive mind is a must. You will work in a young team, cooperate with smart people (there are 600 post docs and PhDs out of 1200 employees) and enjoy work-life balance. Plus, foreigners can get a 30% tax discount. Come and help us fight cancer!<p>Drop me an email if interested: j.hudecek@nki.nl","time":1435785650,"type":"comment"}
