Algorithm design and mathematical software\n  development (statistics, estimation&#x2F;controls) through\n  prototyping, performance analysis, and implementation on\n  production hardware and web services.\n  http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.swiftnav.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;3_est.html\n\n  * Organizational details\n\n  0. 15-ish people in the Dogpatch neighborhood of San Francisco,\n  spread across analog&#x2F;RF&#x2F;digital hardware design, statistics&#x2F;\n  estimation&#x2F;controls, (purely) functional programming, and web\n  infrastructure.\n\n  1. Interdisciplinary work, with an environment emphasizing\n  effective communication, collaboration, and inclusion.\n\n  2. Flexible working policy, relevant for those with families and\n  children.\n\n  3. Some non-traditional benefits: thoughtful management, dedicated\n  bike parking, ample Dadaism, a backyard with a banana tree, and a \n  gas stove with well-seasoned cast-iron.</code></pre>","time":1435856257,"type":"comment"}
