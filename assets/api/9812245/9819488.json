It&#x27;s a 2 year program where students learn CS theory, product development and career skills. Our first class graduated to companies like Snapchat and Pandora, and built products featured in publications like the Huffington Post. Students pay nothing upfront and pay tuition through earnings.<p>We&#x27;re looking for Curriculum Engineers with focuses on Ruby on Rails, iOS and CS Theory to build curriculum, teach students and help design the university experience of the future. Ideally you have a strong background in academia (MS or PhD) and relevant (4+ years) industry experience, though neither are required. We expect instructors to continue working on real world projects to serve as the foundation for our project based education and keep their knowledge sharp.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, email me at ashu@makeschool.com!","time":1435850616,"type":"comment"}
