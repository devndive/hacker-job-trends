We work with most major sports teams (NFL, NBA, NHL, NCAA) and broadcasters (ESPN, SiriusXM). In the past year, over 70M events have been synced to 2M users&#x27; calendars. Our technology then surfaces the right content for users within their calendars - tickets &amp; parking info for sporting events, coach interviews, etc. Our tech is also calendar &amp; device agnostic.<p>I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions at smita@stanza.co","time":1435777318,"type":"comment"}
