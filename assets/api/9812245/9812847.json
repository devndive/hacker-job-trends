(YC W15) | Computer vision engineer | Palo Alto, CA | Full-time<p>At Mashgin, we apply advanced computer vision to real world problems, starting with retail checkout. Our kiosk can scan multiple items at once without barcodes or RFID, reducing checkout time by 10x. But that&#x27;s just the beginning -- we’re building the future of machine vision for all businesses.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone with serious engineering skills that can help us fulfill the promise of computer vision in the real world. You should have experience writing vision algorithms in C++. Bonus points if you&#x27;ve worked with 3D cameras, multi-cam scene reconstruction, or machine learning. As the first non-founding engineer you’ll get the chance to shape the foundation of Mashgin.<p>We&#x27;re a team of 3 with previous experience in machine learning at Facebook and Microsoft, and computer vision for humanoid robotics at Bell Labs and Toyota. Mashgin is well funded from top investors following YC W15, and we&#x27;re working hard on getting our machines production ready for our first customers.<p>Right now we&#x27;re in a small, scrappy office in downtown Palo Alto. But we plan on growing fast so things will change quickly. Uncertainty abounds: &quot;...constant danger, safe return doubtful, honor and recognition in case of success.&quot; -- Ernest Shackleton<p>If you&#x27;re interested in joining the team email us at: jobs@mashgin.com","time":1435766674,"type":"comment"}
