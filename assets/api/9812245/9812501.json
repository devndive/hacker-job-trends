You&#x27;re a productive member of your team, but you&#x27;re not yet ready to lead teams. Maybe you want to lead some day, but need the support to get there; or maybe it&#x27;s just not your thing. You should...<p>★ Have experience with JavaScript and Ruby.<p>★ Have strong communication and collaboration skills.<p>★ Enjoy pair programming (we may not pair all the time, but everyone pairs).<p>★ Be curious about other languages and platforms (Go, Swift, iOS, ...).<p>★ Enjoy being given goals and finding ways to achieve them.<p>★ Value Agile XP Practices (Iterative development, \nRefactoring, TDD&#x2F;BDD, CI&#x2F;CD, ...).<p>★ Prior consulting or freelancing experience is a bonus.<p>★ We&#x27;re currently using Ruby (mostly Rails) and JavaScript (Node.js) on the back-end. On the front-end we&#x27;re building sophisticated clients with HTML5&#x2F;JavaScript and Native iOS (Obj-C, Swift). That&#x27;s where we are today, but there&#x27;s no telling how that might evolve over the next few years. We’re always trying new things to see what works for us and our clients.<p>Our developers get a tremendous amount of experience because of how we work with one another and with our clients. Carbon Five is a great place to learn a ton and have a great time doing it.<p>How to apply<p>Please send an email to info@carbonfive.com","time":1435764702,"type":"comment"}
