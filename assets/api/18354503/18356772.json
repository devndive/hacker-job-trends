That is why we hire the best engineers, no matter where they live. We believe small teams work best and fastest, allowing individual engineers to have the biggest impact possible. We hire engineers who learn fast, have great technical judgement, a bias toward shipping and passion for software. We value these characteristics above expertise in a given domain or with a specific language.<p>We do most of our work in JavaScript (webpack&#x2F;babel&#x2F;ES6&#x2F;ES7&#x2F;React), NodeJS and Go. We are also heavy users of AWS Kinesis&#x2F;EMR, ElasticSearch, c3&#x2F;d3.js, Vagrant, Travis CI, Puppet, Ruby&#x2F;Rails and AWS.<p>Moovweb does big things. We autoscale thousands of servers and serve billions of pages per month. We push the limits of what can be done with the front-end of the web. We created a full customer-facing analytics platform on AWS and two Sass libraries: Libsass, the most popular engine for the Sass CSS pre-processor, and gvm, which is rvm for Go.","time":1541095979,"type":"comment"}
