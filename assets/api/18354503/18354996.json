Business is doing well and hit record sales last week. This is the 1st year of the company, size is 200k - 500k net profit&#x2F; year. Our site is visited ~250&#x27;000 times&#x2F; month.<p>I&#x27;m looking for a full product owner who&#x27;s fluent in (Swiss-)German, experienced in online marketing and online sales. You can work remotely, and compensation is fantastic: a real % of total net profits + bonus. Coding skills is a plus.
