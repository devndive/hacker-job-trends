Ideal candidates have at least one year of React&#x2F;React Native programming experience. You will be responsible for developing, maintaining and delivering React Native templates and apps. To start, we anticipate this role requiring 15-20 hours of work per week for 2-3 months, with additional hours to be determined as our needs evolve. New engineers and bootcamp graduates may apply, but please review our job requirements first.<p>We also have a full-time opening for an experienced Ruby Engineer. Ideal candidates have 3+ years of server-side software development experience, in languages like Ruby, Python, Java or Perl, and 5+ years working in command-line unix&#x2F;linux development environments. Candidates should have experience working with large, 24&#x2F;7 consumer software applications with demanding uptime requirements. SCRUFF is among the largest customers of numerous Amazon Web Services, so experience with the AWS stack in particular or distributed systems in general is a plus. Testing is essential to ensure our 24&#x2F;7 service is always running smoothly, so experience with testing frameworks or test-driven design is highly desirable. The SCRUFF server stack is implemented in Ruby (Sinatra, not Rails), so past Ruby experience is a plus.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scruff.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scruff.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;careers</a>","time":1541087314,"type":"comment"}
