Our goal is to help the oil and gas industry, water municipalities, and anyone dealing with fluid optimize allocations while reducing spills and theft. Our sensor is a self-contained unit attached to a pipe which sends ultrasonic data directly to our server via cellular&#x2F;satellite; we then use a mix of physics equations, signal processing, and anomaly detection to determine the behavior of fluid (volume and speed).<p>We are a small software team based in San Francisco with offices in Houston and Mexico City. You’ll work on models to improve the performance of our 100+ sensors deployed around the world. You’ll also leverage our remotely controllable flow-loop test facility in Houston to generate training data from our sensors. Join us if you want to be a leader at a rapidly growing company that’s using innovative technology to solve hard problems in the physical world.<p>Software Stack - Python, Django, Postgres, React\nContact: jobs@flowcommand.com","time":1541095124,"type":"comment"}
