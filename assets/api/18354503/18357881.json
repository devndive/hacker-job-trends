We&#x27;re looking for a senior full-stack software engineer, someone who is professional, takes pride in their work, and is comfortable working remotely and dealing directly with clients. Depending on the needs of our clients, we take on end-to-end projects or integrate with existing development teams.<p>Over the past two years, we’ve worked with a wide variety of clients, which means a wide variety of tech, and we pride ourselves on being able to adapt and deliver. While we are looking for a seasoned engineer, we don’t require you to have experience using a particular language or framework; the ability to pick things up as you go is what’s essential. That said, we&#x27;re currently doing a lot of work in Node, React, and Shopify so bonus consideration will be given if you have experience with these.<p>We work remotely from our home offices and you would, too.  You’ll interact directly with clients and have the freedom to set your own schedule and complete your projects however you work best.<p>Get in touch if you’d like to be the third member of a small, professional team.","time":1541102683,"type":"comment"}
