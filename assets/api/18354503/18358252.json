You will be implementing and operating the services as a senior software engineer.<p>The platform we are operating today is Pivotal Cloud Foundry so experience with Cloud Foundry or similar is a big bonus, but is not strictly required.<p>The project we are working on is called Kessel Run, you can Google articles or reach out to me directly (eric@f9teams.com) if you want to learn more.<p>The only strict requirement is that you be eligible to receive a security clearance at some point in the future. Mostly this means US Citizen with a felony free background who would be able to pass a drug test (weed is not a problem).","time":1541105102,"type":"comment"}
