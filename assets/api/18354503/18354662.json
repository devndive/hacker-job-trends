We find vulnerabilities and risks in our system before they lead to customer-facing outages. To find vulnerabilities, we build Chaos tools that allow us to inject events that we expect the system to handle, and check that the service stays healthy. We are currently leveraging these tools to build a platform for load testing services with production traffic. This platform allows us to better understand the limits of our production systems. Finally, we track patterns of risks and vulnerabilities, which inform us of our biggest availability challenges and help us come up with risk mitigation strategies.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.netflix.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;867867\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.netflix.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;867867</a>","time":1541085168,"type":"comment"}
