We&#x27;ve developed a two-wheeled ebike that will autononously deliver itself to customers who then ride it like a normal ebike. Looking for people who are passionate about robots and love small electric vehicles. We think we can beat self driving cars to 100 million miles. Our bikes will seriously challenge you as we make autonomy work without $100k of lidar and compute, but we benefit from a lightweight and narrow vehicle that can avoid traffic and stop in under 5ft.<p>Curious? davidhansen@bikeweel.com","time":1541092474,"type":"comment"}
