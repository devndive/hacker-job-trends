Magic is a simple idea with endless potential - one phone number that you can send a text message to 24&#x2F;7 and get anything you want, whenever you want it. Food, flowers, plane tickets, reservations, electronics, you name it. We fulfill these requests magically for our users by being a common interface to a growing network of national and international service providers. Most of our users use us on a regular basis to make their lives easier and to be more productive, but of course, we fulfill our share of crazy requests: meeting celebrities, skywriting, 1,000 gallons of seawater, helicopters, motorcycles...<p>But all of this is just the beginning. Magic is a command line interface to the world; it is an API for everything. You can’t &quot;sudo cancel my Comcast subscription&quot; but you can &quot;magic cancel my Comcast subscription.&quot; It’s a unified plaintext interface that sits as a layer of abstraction over the set of all possible products, services, and actions. It’s the Star Trek computer. It’s your companion and your friend.<p>Magic was founded in 2015 by a team of software engineers with one simple premise: create a natural language interface to the complexity of the world, delivered by a combination of artificial intelligence and human expertise. We are hardcore developers at heart, we are highly iterative, and we are relentless. We are minimal and focused on writing code that really matters. We don&#x27;t stop until we are done.<p>Our primary technologies right now are Node.js, Meteor, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, Ansible. Experience with these are very nice but not required. We believe in using the right tool for the job.<p>We are currently hiring for senior and mid-level engineering positions. This is a full-stack, generalist role for which you will be given a high degree of autonomy and will be expected to deploy impactful code to production in your first week. We&#x27;re less concerned with your resume and more concerned with your ability to get real stuff done.<p>Come build the future of human-computer interaction with us.<p>Bonus points if you&#x27;ve got...<p>- Experience working with Node.js, Meteor, modern web application frameworks\n- Experience with devops, the AWS suite, Docker, Ansible, Jenkins\n- Experience within early-stage startups or human operations companies<p>Apply here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getmagic.com&#x2F;engineering&#x2F;apply&#x2F;hn\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getmagic.com&#x2F;engineering&#x2F;apply&#x2F;hn</a>","time":1541444818,"type":"comment"}
