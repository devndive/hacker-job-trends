We are in a growing, opportunity-rich enterprise market: For every $1 paid to Salesforce, $3 more are spent on customizing it.<p>Looking for a Python, Go or Node developer to join our 2 person team. An interest in source control systems and theory is a major plus.<p>So far we have hired slowly because we believe in maintaining high-revenue per employee. We admire companies like Basecamp, Mailchimp and Atlassian. We are funded by customer revenue and Indie.vc (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indie.vc&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indie.vc&#x2F;</a>).<p>Our stack is primarily Python and Go (Node.js developers interested in learning Go should also apply).
