Pick two if you dare.\n  - Family-friendly: Sane hours, generous vacations.\n  - Benefits: Health.\n  - Financial security: Enough pay so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it.\n  - A stake in success: A sizeable stock option grant.\n  - Something different about us: \n       - Our customers aren&#x27;t just numbers on the dashboard, we work \n         face to face with many. I know *why* I come to work.\n       - We work with bits and bytes, but we can clearly see physical \n         goods being moved in response. It&#x27;s refreshing to work with tangible \n         goods in the age of ephemeral products.\n</code></pre>\ndenis@amptab.com","time":1480622123,"type":"comment"}
