We run intensive, seven-week Fellowship programs three times a year during which programmers learn data engineering tools through self-directed projects that they then present to companies in the hopes of landing an awesome data engineering job. The program is free for Fellows. As a program director you&#x27;ll be able to help recruit and guide Fellows during the seven week program. As a data engineer, you&#x27;ll also have a lot of latitude to develop technically and keep your coding and DE skills sharp. It&#x27;s a great job that leverages your computer science background and people skills. Email me, hoa, at insightdataengineering with questions.
