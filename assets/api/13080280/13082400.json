We provide convenient, fresh, hot, personalized meals direct to customers who order and pay from their smartphones.<p>We are a bootstrapped startup in China&#x27;s most livable city, currently in hardware prototyping phase with a comfortable office&#x2F;lab, a legal entity, and a team of two. We mostly cycle or walk to work, don&#x27;t currently draw salaries and are engaged in refining our prototype before seeking investment circa mid 2017 when we aim to be ready to manufacture. We have investors lining up already.<p>We would consider bringing on a new founder with strong mechanical engineering experience. CAM, RP&#x2F;RT, foodtech, materials science and commercial manufacturing experience well regarded.<p>Discuss: walter at 8-food dot com","time":1480619239,"type":"comment"}
