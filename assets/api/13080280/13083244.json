What you may not know is that the team that builds our official apps just turned 1 year old and is still only 5 engineers with backgrounds from big companies like Instagram and Google to startups like Weebly and Sincerely. A couple of us, including me, were actually startup founders ourselves.<p>Despite Reddit drama (which doesn&#x27;t really effect engineering), our engineering team is in better shape than ever. Our apps are well loved at 4.5+ stars on both platforms, and used by millions of people every month. We&#x27;re planning to grow fast on the mobile team over the next year and are hiring for iOS and Android at pretty much all levels of experience.<p>&lt;my hackernews username&gt; @ reddit.com","time":1480624387,"type":"comment"}
