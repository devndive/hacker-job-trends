We started one year ago as two guys in a London flat, shipped 6,000 boxes without getting kicked out (our neighbours love us), running operations during day and writing code during night. We&#x27;ve now raised a (really) big seed round from (really) top-tier investors and moved to a (really) big warehouse. We are assembling a (real) rockstar team.<p>Here’s how Weengs works: we collect unboxed items from our customers, bring them to our warehouse, package them carefully with our own materials, then ship them using major shipping carriers like Royal Mail, DPD, or DHL at the best available prices. We work with individuals around London via our mobile app as well as with e-commerce platforms that have integrated with our system.","time":1480618487,"type":"comment"}
