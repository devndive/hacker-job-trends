Our revamped application is used by millions, converts 35% better, and halves the completion time.<p>It turns out there’s a lot more to reimagine within government services, which is why we’re partnering with the Department of Veterans Affairs to modernize their appeals system, making millions of veteran’s lives better through the process. Today, the average appeal takes 5 years to process; we can fix this.<p>It’s surprising how much can be done by a small group of empathetic people with a Silicon Valley mindset, deep technical experience, working closely with dedicated civil servants in government. We’ve started Nava as a public benefit corporation to radically improve how our government serves its people, and we believe that the services our government provides should be clear and reliable.
