We make amazing software to help banks manage know-your-customer checks and anti-money laundering (KYC&#x2F;AML). It&#x27;s what&#x27;s perhaps most broken about banks and we&#x27;re helping to fix it all over the world.<p>At the moment we&#x27;re looking for a generalist engineering profile (senior, midlevel or junior) and one specialist graph analysis role:<p>1. GENERALIST: Pull-up-your-sleeves mentality, expertise with web development (Python&#x2F;Go&#x2F;JS are our main languages). Like seeing things through to completion.<p>2. GRAPH DATA: Most risk problems boil down to relationships that can be teased out of data. We&#x27;re looking for someone who has worked on complex graph data issues. Experience at scale is a big advantage. If you have strong opinions about Spark, Neo4j and&#x2F;or Palantir, get in touch.<p>Drop me a line (email in profile) if any questions.<p>Email jobs@arachnys.com to apply.
