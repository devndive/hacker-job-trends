Our team has achieved breakthrough results in changing the behaviors that determine health outcomes, such as doubling adherence to medications that keep people healthy and out of the hospital, establishing new insights into patient engagement.<p>These results were enabled by the Way To Health platform, a unique technology asset now poised to move beyond research into broader clinical applications. The role we’re looking to fill is critical to expanding our impact. We need someone who can not only work with our team of internationally recognized thought leaders to identify and implement functionality and designs making interventions more effective, but also has the ability to evolve Way to Health into a scalable clinical platform that can be deployed efficiently in larger populations.<p>This role also affords the right candidate a great deal of autonomy in both how you do your work and in crafting a vision for the technology. We’re looking for team members who love problem solving and finding better ways to get things done.<p>Email me at mkopinsky@waytohealth.org for more info.","time":1443737653,"type":"comment"}
