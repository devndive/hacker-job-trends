Where in the past we have focused on advertising, we recently launched a lifetime value maximization platform to help freemium app publishers maximize their ROI and engage their users more effectively.<p>We use ruby extensively, but also have services using Go and Scala, and are generally looking for the right technology to solve a problem rather than dogmatically insisting on one stack. We have a fairly strong focus on engineering as a discipline, but are small enough as an engineering team to still enable one voice to make a large impact. Communication has become a strong point of our team by necessity as we have engineers in San Francisco, Atlanta, and Boston, and have a global team, with offices all over the world.<p>You can see our openings here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;home.tapjoy.com&#x2F;info&#x2F;about-tapjoy&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;home.tapjoy.com&#x2F;info&#x2F;about-tapjoy&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a><p>If you&#x27;re interested I strongly recommend you reach out to me directly: jason.carr at tapjoy dot com","time":1443729978,"type":"comment"}
