The role would be a great opportunity to work on some React (and React native) projects with us and figure out what your next move might be, whether that’s starting a company, joining a company, or something else entirely. There’s a bit more info up here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kpcbedge.com&#x2F;roles\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kpcbedge.com&#x2F;roles</a> (you can ignore the iOS requirement—we’ve been experimenting with React Native to target mobile and had great results so far).<p>To tell you a bit more about us, we spend half our time investing and half our time building products to try to solve common problems faced by the founders we’re investing in (happy to explain this further directly). Everyone in the partnership is technical, and we ship code for the aforementioned products ourselves.
