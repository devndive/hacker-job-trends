We are funded by some of the top investors in the valley, including Y Combinator, Greylock, Google Ventures, and US Venture Partners. Our goal is simply to be the way people sign documents everywhere.<p>We are centrally located in downtown San Francisco by Union Square. Currently at 40 employees, we are growing the company deliberately, with an eye towards maintaining a culture that values lifestyle, fun, and continuous improvement (we were recently awarded the Hirepalooza Culture Award for Lifestyle in early 2015!).","time":1443717257,"type":"comment"}
