Based on client needs, we also built a new order management and workflow system to let them enter their clients&#x27; orders and process them based on custom product definitions and workflows. That way, they can use our platform from start to finish (enter their orders, have campaigns created in third-party platforms via APIs, and then use our existing reporting capabilities).<p>As part of our growth, we&#x27;re now looking for a full-stack developer who will be able to add new features to the application, working both on the PHP backend and the Angular frontend.<p>Ideally, we&#x27;d like a software developer with at least 3 years of experience who:\n- Is smart and self-motivated;<p>- Is familiar with the LAMP development stack;<p>- Is experienced with the Angular framework;<p>- Is detail-oriented;<p>- Is a fast learner;<p>- Can innovate&#x2F;make improvements without always needing a precise spec;<p>- Is a great communicator (we&#x27;re a distributed team);<p>- Has a bachelor degree or higher (nice to have - not required);<p>- Has experience with third-party APIs (nice to have - not required);<p>- Has previous experience with digital marketing and&#x2F;or order entry system  (nice to have - not required).<p>Is this something that could interest you?
