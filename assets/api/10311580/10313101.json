Fundamentally, the act of parking has not changed much over the last 50 years, with our solution: you simply find, park and pay if required, using your smart-phone. Our solution demands perfection in multiple disciplines ranging from hardware, embedded software, a robust backend and delightful applications (which is where you come in).<p>You are energetic, hungry for responsibility and want to shake up a few parking spots. You are detail oriented and treat your git-repo like a temple. You may or may-not like coffee, but like being around people who do! Most importantly: you crave a fun and fast paced ride.<p>If interested email us at jobs@ottoq.com with some cool stuff that you have built or help create. We can also help you relocate if there is a mutual match!","time":1443722231,"type":"comment"}
