Currently we have around 800 people in the tech department, but we need more. You will work in a reasonably small team (&quot;two pizzas&quot;) and influence decisions accordingly. Teams prioritize their work themselves. We will help you with relocation. We have offices in Berlin, Dortmund (Germany), Dublin, Helsinki. Also you get 40 % discount.","time":1443725094,"type":"comment"}
