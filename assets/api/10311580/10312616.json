In 2013, we set out to build a better product, and a better experience than what was offered to us. Along the way, we&#x27;ve found a passion for creating products of value. Careers at Tuft &amp; Needle go well beyond competitive pay, benefits, and perks (although we have all of those). We&#x27;re much more than a mattress company. At Tuft &amp; Needle, we are a collection of entrepreneurs who have come together to build something we could not have done on our own.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tuftandneedle.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tuftandneedle.com&#x2F;jobs</a><p>email sean at tuftandneedle dot com","time":1443718730,"type":"comment"}
