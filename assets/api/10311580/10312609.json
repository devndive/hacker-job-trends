We&#x27;re used by almost half of the top MBA programs across North America, and are quickly growing in engineering, undergraduate business and science programs. We haven&#x27;t had a single school churn and we just acquired our first competitor.<p>Here&#x27;s what we use: Python (Django), JavaScript (jQuery, RequireJS, FlightJS), Bower, MySQL, Celery, RabbitMQ, Wowza, AWS,.<p>Since we’re a small company (you’d be #21), we have lots of fun together! We host bi-weekly lunch &amp; learns, beer o’clock on Friday afternoons, board game nights every few weeks and have done tons of activities outside of work (e.g. wine tasting, cottage retreat, movie nights).<p>My name is Konrad, and I&#x27;m one of the founders!
