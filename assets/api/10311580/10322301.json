Among other positions we are looking for an iOS developer that can drive our product and code base to a totally new level.<p>World-class companies (Apple, Mercedes, Nordstrom to mention a few) use Medallia to create awesome customer experiences. Our platform already includes a mobile solution covering both Android and iOS users, providing them the ability to engage with customers in real-time, share aggregated data, or analyze customer feedback on-the-go.<p>We want to take this platform to the next stage, by increasing the social aspect of our application to make it a vital part of our client&#x27;s organization, and by increasing its the personalization capabilities, so each one of our users can tailor it to their particular needs and goals. We also want to experiment on innovative ways of capturing customer experience information, and on helping companies to engage their employees on a customer oriented culture.<p>For that we&#x27;ve started playing with new frameworks and technologies such React Native, Flux and Graph QL in order to make our development more agile, extensible and simple. This is posible given that we won&#x27;t need to recompile every time after a change, that we can have a server with the app&#x27;s content (we don&#x27;t have to wait for apples review) and that we can reuse existing javascript libraries that work great.<p>Please contact me at jmrodriguez@medallia.com if any of the above sounds interesting to you.<p>Juan Manuel Rodriguez, iOS Software Engineer.","time":1443837320,"type":"comment"}
