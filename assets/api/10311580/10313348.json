You love the hottest, shiniest tech out there, but you know to temper your excitement when the tech hasn’t earned its place amongst the tried and true yet. You don’t shy away from a good debate, especially if it comes with a variety of opposing viewpoints. You do what you say, when you say you will. You probably won&#x27;t ever give up writing code, and you get immense satisfaction from teaching others the thrill of the art.<p>Up for the challenge?
