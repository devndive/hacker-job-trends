It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after five years, half of all schools in the US (and 90 of the 100 biggest districts) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be a full-cycle marketplace where schools can identify, purchase, integrate, and evaluate the hundreds of educational apps they&#x27;re using.<p>We’re a team of about 115 (35 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Golang, Node and React.

The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.<p>- Robustness. The goal here is to produce a set of signals around any given academic paper that indicate how robust the paper’s claims and findings are.<p>It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the academic literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis”. Peer review is not a robustness filter; we need a separate filter to indicate robustness.<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 19 million pdfs to Academia.edu. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to robustness, we think the way to build a robustness layer on top of papers is a) to mine the existing graph of citations for commentary and (b) crowd-source commentary&#x2F;peer review from the academic community.<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (b), and a citation graph infrastructure that is the basis of our approach to (a). We believe that addressing robustness is a challenge and an opportunity. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us.<p>We have raised $33 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. The company is profitable off a premium subscription model. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes &quot;We believe open science is really important.

Most of the team works from our office in South Africa. However, 2 months ago I moved Singapore for work &#x2F; personal reasons. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone will now be remote from my perspective, I decided it&#x27;s a good time to start focusing on hiring for remote work. We&#x27;ve already hired 3 remote developers though HN!<p>SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses.<p>This month we&#x27;re not looking for regular developers, but rather something I&#x27;ve often seen referred to as an Analyst Developer. This position is much more focused on requirements, but you&#x27;ll still need solid programming skills. If you think you&#x27;d enjoy researching tax &#x2F; employment compliance issues for different countries, speccing out a design and then moving to implementation, this position would suit you.<p>The work will include: Doing research on tax &#x2F; employment laws and procedures for new markets we want to enter. Speccing the implementation for a country and doing most of the implementation, with help from more technology-focused developers for the more complicated parts. Doing updates for our existing markets as legal requirements change over time.<p>Experience: You&#x27;ll need a lot of experience in gathering requirements and creating specs. Most of your requirement-gathering will involve research, but there will be some human interaction too - there will be a lot of debate about the best way to help our clients be compliant in the most user-friendly way! As such, a good feel for UX will come in handy too. Any programming experience is OK, but Ruby is preferred.<p>Location: Most of the team is in GMT+2, and I&#x27;ll be in GMT+8 going forward. So anything from GMT+0 to GMT+8 should be OK, unless you keep unusual working hours. We are a registered employer in South Africa and Singapore, so it would be hassle-free if you&#x27;re based in those countries. If not, and if you&#x27;ve never done remote work for a foreign company before, please be sure to find out how to legally do this iin your particular country (it may involve registering as self-employed, for example).<p>Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za and put &quot;Hacker News&quot; somewhere in the subject.

We&#x27;ve done a lot to make the interview experience better for all stakeholders that I could write whole essays about, but suffice it to say that candidates love working with us, clients love working with us, and we&#x27;re well-funded and growing quickly as a result.<p>Because of this quickly-growing demand, we&#x27;re looking to hire more Expert Interviewers. The ideal candidate is a software engineer with strong written and verbal English skills with at least a few years of professional experience. Interviewing experience would be great, but we spend 25 hours (paid) training you before you even start, so if you&#x27;re strong technically and love working with people we can usually make it work :) Interviews are conducted over video chat, using a collaborative code editor.<p>Some of our interviewers are freelancers who use our scheduling model to backfill hours; others are full timers at top tech companies looking to make some extra cash; others have quit their jobs to work with us full time; some are digital nomads; one of our interviewers is road tripping around North America for a year and a half, doing anywhere from zero to 40 interviews each week depending on where he is and what the weather&#x27;s like.<p>The application form is here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced64c86?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source=HNWH\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced6...</a><p>I know it&#x27;s a pretty unique job, so if you have any questions reply here or email me at josh@karat.io and I&#x27;m happy to talk through any of it.<p>P.S.
