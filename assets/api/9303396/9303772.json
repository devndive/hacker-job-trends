We are a growing, fast moving team of technologists who are also all very actively involved in and contributing to the Philly Tech community. We are looking for a self-motivated engineer to join our team and take our product to the next level. You will have the opportunity to work on various interesting projects – from mobile development and platform design to server operations and deployment, and everything in between. Be ready to enhance the team by bringing your unique knowledge to the table, and we will enhance your skills by doing the same and challenging you to learn more. We are polyglots at our core, and like to use the right language for the job. To this end, much of our architecture is constructed as micro-services. This is something that can, of course, be improved upon and refined. Our core technologies include MongoDB, Ruby, Node.js, Kafka, and Docker&#x2F;Deis. On the mobile side we also use Objective-C, Java (both for Android and back-end), C#, and client-side JavaScript. For those of you with interest in ops, we also use Docker, etcd, Puppet, and a variety of VM-based technologies such as AMIs, OpenStack machine images, and more. There’s even some nascent work with Deis and other open source PaaS technologies.","time":1427898278,"type":"comment"}
