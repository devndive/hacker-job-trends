We are hiring technical staff at all levels, from INTERN (hurry, the competition is fierce) to people with decades of experience. We hire doctorates (PhD), but don&#x27;t actually require any degree at all. Desired skills relate to reverse engineering, disassembly, emulators, JIT, hypervisors, security vulnerability research, compilers, binary static analysis, formal methods, malware, hacking, boot loaders, x86, PowerPC&#x2F;PPC, MIPS, ARM, IDA Pro, kernels, constraint solvers, drivers, and embedded systems.<p>SI is mainly in Florida (Indialantic), Maryland, Virginia, and Texas (Austin, San Antonio). It&#x27;s a place with extreme flex time, T-shirts and jeans (or shorts even), normally 40-hour weeks with the option for paid overtime if you want it, your choice of desktop OS, real walls (most locations), and lots of mischievous bright nerds with maker attitude. We get you a security clearance, so US citizenship is required.<p>To apply, go to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rtnsi.theresumator.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rtnsi.theresumator.com&#x2F;</a> and select one of the following job titles:<p><pre><code>  * Software Engineer &#x2F; CNO Developer\n  * Static Analysis Research Engineer\n  * Vulnerability Researcher &#x2F; CNO Analyst\n</code></pre>\n(note: the &quot;Melbourne&quot; location is actually Indialantic, where you can get a house within a mile of the beach for 5 figures)","time":1427910052,"type":"comment"}
