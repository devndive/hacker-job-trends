We do this by monitoring the energy that a building is using in real-time, analyzing the results, and messaging our customers about exactly how to save money and understand the operations of the building. We can detect sick appliances and warn you before they break. We can help you understand how your building is being used. We can help you reduce your energy bill.<p>We&#x27;re all very excited that we get to reduce humanity&#x27;s energy consumption every day.<p>- Distributed systems generalist: We have lots of exciting challenges to solve to scale up our machine learning and analytics systems (python, with a shift towards a more multi-lingual environment).<p>- Lead Rails&#x2F;Front End: We&#x27;re also hiring for Rails and front-end devs.  We don&#x27;t have anyone else dedicated 100% to front-end at the moment so there is lots of room to own that stack.<p>Keywords: Python, Rails, Backbone, AWS, Machine Learning, Docker, Service Oriented Architecture<p>If you&#x27;re interested get a hold of me at zdwiel@plotwatt.com","time":1427935954,"type":"comment"}
