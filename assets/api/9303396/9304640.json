We help companies who need to store massive amounts of data to do so easily, safely, and cheaply in their own data centers.  We’re committed to open-source; everything we put into Swift we push upstream.  We also develop a valuable proprietary orchestration system that’s our core revenue driver.<p>Reach out to us if you have any of the following:<p><pre><code>  * Experience writing high-performance server software (Python&#x2F;C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Go)\n  * A deep and abiding interest in distributed (storage) systems \n  * Vision that simplifies complex user workflows  (front end&#x2F;UI&#x2F;UX)\n</code></pre>\nApply at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;swiftstack.workable.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;27475\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;swiftstack.workable.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;27475</a>, or email jobs@swiftstack.com if you have questions.","time":1427904369,"type":"comment"}
