We are the company behind npm, dedicated to improving the experience of JavaScript developers all over the world by reducing friction. We are hiring for all four of our teams:<p>- support: &quot;npm loves you&quot; is our unofficial motto. Taking good care of npm users who run into trouble is central to our mission.<p>- CLI: maintain and improve the npm command itself. With over 3MM users, we get a lot of feature requests and edge cases.<p>- www: we get 5MM page views a month, and a bunch of new features are in the works.<p>- registry: more than 50MM fresh downloads every single day, we are a big, high-traffic distributed system.<p>The CLI, the website, and major parts of the registry itself are all open-source.<p>We are not a typical startup. We believe that working sensible hours and taking care of ourselves and our loved ones is the best way to ensure long-term productivity. We care deeply about making tech a more inclusive and diverse place to work.<p>For more details on the jobs and us, see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;npmjs.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;npmjs.com&#x2F;jobs</a>","time":1427901161,"type":"comment"}
