We are the Seattle outpost of a large company headquartered in another state. We enjoy the freedom and autonomy of a startup but also have actual benefits and financial stability. We work hard for aggressive deadlines but we also believe in work-family balance for real (half of us have kids) and we have a good gender balance on the team. Ideally you have C#&#x2F;DevExpress experience, but what&#x27;s more important is the ability to work collaboratively. We&#x27;re all in one team room so we work closely together, literally.<p>To apply on the official company website: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sunquestinfo.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;job-opportunities\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sunquestinfo.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;job-opportunities</a>\n(Select Jobs by Location, then Seattle)<p>If you have questions for the team, I&#x27;m the scrum master:\njina.chan@sunquestinfo.com","time":1428105565,"type":"comment"}
