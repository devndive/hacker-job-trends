Back-end software engineer.<p>We are a data-driven SAAS company that helps energy utilities and their end-customers manage and reduce their energy consumption.  Our team in Vancouver was a late-stage startup, Pulse Energy.  We were acquired by EnerNOC about four months ago and this has allowed us to scale up the team.<p>We value work-life balance -- once we find a good developer, we want to keep them.  Many team members work from home occasionally and some are full-time remote.  We all take our vacation time, and for those who need an extended break, unpaid leaves of absence are fine. Family-friendly - many of us are parents.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.enernoc.com&#x2F;vancouver&#x2F;software-engineering&#x2F;jobid7045320-back-end-software-engineer-jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.enernoc.com&#x2F;vancouver&#x2F;software-engineering&#x2F;jobid...</a>","time":1427915128,"type":"comment"}
