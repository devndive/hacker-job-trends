Later VISA sponsorship to Singapore possible.<p>Our main product is the Buccaneer, a 3D printer designed to be affordable, sleek and user-friendly. We are currently ongoing a partial rewrite of our entire software stack −from native apps all the way down to the firmware−, and are looking to expand our −currently 5 programmers strong− software team, to help in this endeavor.<p>You will join our team over on GitHub, Slack and Google Hangout, and will be given the choice over which project you want to contribute to. Projects include the firmware −to control motors and sensors−, the backend −to give the printer intelligence and behavior−, the protocol −to interface between printer and smartphone over WiFi−, and the native-apps −for users to communicate with the printer. Firmware, backend and protocol are written in C++, while the native-apps are in the platforms&#x27; respective languages.<p>We will send you a printer to experiment with if it works out after a week or two.<p>If interested, send an email with your achievements and aspirations to Kai at contact@kaielvin.org","time":1427907559,"type":"comment"}
