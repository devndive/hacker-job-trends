Looking for mid to senior level candidates to work on a variety of government and commercial contracts. Skills needed would be mostly SQL, Java or .net, with a variety of technologies like lucene, weka, etc. Lots of piloting and proof of concepts in areas as diverse as pharmaceutical competitive intelligence to compliance at Office of Inspector Generals. Not so much worried about the buzz words or specific languages, really looking for developers who can pick up new languages&#x2F;technologies and be adaptable. We tend to hire people who also can interact with clients face to face, so decent communication skills as well. resumes to mspiering@eastportanalytics.com","time":1427935454,"type":"comment"}
