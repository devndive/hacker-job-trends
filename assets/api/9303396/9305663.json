This not only creates a fragmented experience, but also adds up to additional costs in order to acquire the necessary hardware in addition to the apps.<p>With PoyntOS all such solutions can be made available on the same payment terminal that every merchant uses on their counter. While we take care of the core payment processing for the merchant with their acquirer of their choice you can focus on building the rest of the solutions that makes the merchant more productive and run a successful business.<p>We are a small startup with an incredible team.  We are a unique company in that we work on: hardware, a novel operating system forked from AOSP, and our own ecosystem of applications made to help millions of small businesses.<p>This means that you would have huge impact in a small engineering team building things you wouldn’t be able to work anywhere else.<p>The founding team has done a great job of hiring diverse, energetic, and experienced engineers and we hope to find many more to deliver the finest tools for millions of businesses.","time":1427912340,"type":"comment"}
