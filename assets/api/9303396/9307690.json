Since our initial funding from Y Combinator in 2009, we have bootstrapped a profitable company centered around a simple, powerful, and beautiful chat product that 9000+ businesses use every day to talk to customers. With two major offices and remote teammates across the world, our small 30-person organization is tight-knit and collaborative despite the distance between us. We believe our positive, participatory, and peer-driven team culture plays a big part in driving our growing success.
