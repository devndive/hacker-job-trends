Fast Company named us one of the 9 best ideas at CES.<p>I am looking for a software developer that has experience developing CAD software. We are using web gl to develop new CAD software that allows our users to design circuits in 3D. One of the perks of course will be that you can use our printer to design and print whatever you want!<p>Technologies we are using:<p>* Javascript&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;WebGL<p>* Docker<p>* Python&#x2F;numpy&#x2F;scipy<p>* Julia<p>* Microcontrollers&#x2F;Arduinos (C&#x2F;C++)<p>I am looking for people who are:<p>* Self directed<p>* Able to propose and meet their own milestones<p>* Work with end users of our machine<p>Voxel8 is the hottest new startup in 3D printing and we are changing the way electronics are manufactured.
