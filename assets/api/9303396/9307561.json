Embedded development (electronics design and schematic\ncapture, embedded software, FPGA-based DSP) for our next\ngeneration receivers though prototyping, testing, and\nmanufacturing.<p>1. We use Python&#x2F;Numpy for algorithm prototyping&#x27;analysis,\nand collaborate on some custom continuous integration tools for firmware acceptance testing.<p>* Organizational details<p>0. We&#x27;re currently at 13-ish people in the Dogpatch neighborhood of San Francisco, with work spread across analog&#x2F;RF&#x2F;digital hardware design, statistics&#x2F; estimation&#x2F;controls, (purely) functional programming, and distributed systems&#x2F;casual webapp development.<p>1. Much of our work is interdisciplinary, with an environment\nemphasizing effective communication, collaboration, and inclusion.<p>2.
