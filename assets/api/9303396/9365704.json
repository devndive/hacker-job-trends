As such we have little time for titles, “senior” means that you have more experience and deeper skills, it does not mean that you are someone’s boss. We focus on “output”, holding ourselves and each other to a very high standard.<p>Battlefy is the workplace where it is expected that you’ll need to play MOBAs in order to get into the right frame of mind before brainstorming on a new product idea, where you are able to argue the merits of gamepad Vs joystick in an award winning blog posting, and where all disagreements are settled by Super Mario Bros. 3 speedruns.<p>You’ll help make the largest tournaments in the world and see everyday players rise to be legends. While doing so you’ll receive a competitive salary, flexible hours, health benefits, a $2,000 hardware budget to buy a gaming rig and the support of a talented team that shares your passion and enthusiasm for video games.<p>Ideally this position is based in Vancouver, Canada; however, if you have the technical and communication skills then we&#x27;re happy to try remote working.","time":1428893016,"type":"comment"}
