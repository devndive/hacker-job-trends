Knowledge of JS, esp. Backbone and Underscore, is a big plus.<p>I&#x27;m a software dev, not a recruiter, so I can&#x27;t give you a fancy description.<p>Basically, we build custom CRM solutions using PHP and JavaScript. At 15 employees or so, we&#x27;re a small company. We&#x27;re not a rapidly expanding, venture capitally funded start-up. Just a small, growing business. We work humane hours.<p>I&#x27;ve had more fun at this gig than at any other job I&#x27;ve ever had. The people make the place great.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, contact us via our website or Twitter, @AtcoreSystems.","time":1427928377,"type":"comment"}
