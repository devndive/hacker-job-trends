We launched exactly one year ago and have grown from zero to selling one heck of a lot of natural soap and sustainably-sourced toilet paper on the Internet. Marketing has played a huge role in this, led by our founding team, but our needs have now outstripped out abilities and we need someone more experienced than us to steer our efforts. We&#x27;re looking for someone wth a strong voice that can strengthen our brand, and experience with email marketing. You should be reasonably quantitative, but also have opinions and instincts about what makes a brand great. This role reports to the CEO and will help us drive grown through multiple channels (though not so much CPC).<p>We recently closed our first round of institutional capital, have a fast-growing and lovely customer base, a terrific, sun-lit office, and have a couple of rescue dogs who nap under the desks and occasionally bark at the UPS man. Thus, we have all the tools in place for massive success - once you join us.<p>You can contact me - chris@epantry.com. Can&#x27;t wait!","time":1427896321,"type":"comment"}
