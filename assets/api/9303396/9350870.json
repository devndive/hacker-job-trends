We use our technology and an A&#x2F;B testing platform to help them motivate their existing customers to provide a source of new customers - referring friends, family and colleagues to products they like. We then reward both parties for a successful referral.<p>Business is taking off, and we&#x27;re looking for a software engineer to join our team (as well as other non-technical roles too! Account management and sales are key). We&#x27;re currently PHP (Symfony 2) based using ElasticSearch, AWS and MySQL, but as we collect more information, add more clients and build new features we&#x27;ll certainly be changing parts of that. We&#x27;ve got ideas and a vision for the future but haven&#x27;t got the people to make it happen. We&#x27;re looking for someone who can join us to define it, build it and make it a reality.<p>In a nutshell, we&#x27;re looking for someone smart, technical, and a get-things-done style. Chat to us if you&#x27;d like to know more.<p>Our email address is in our headers @ mention-me.com or in my profile and I&#x27;ll gladly answer any questions.","time":1428612036,"type":"comment"}
