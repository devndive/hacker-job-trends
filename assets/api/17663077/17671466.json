We have a number of exciting opportunities, and therefore need to expand the development team.<p>I am looking for my first developer, reporting directly to me. We are using Python, Django and PostgreSQL on the back-end, Javascript and jQuery on the front-end, all deployed on AWS. As the first developer in a start-up, you will be involved with all aspects of the development process: specification, development, testing, release, support.<p>Ideally, the developer would work core-hours of 10-4.30 (UK time), with a brief stand-up at 10 each day.  I have grown development teams successfully in previous start-ups, but I am still open to ideas for improvements.<p>Interview process consists of: short coding test (should take no more than 1 hour); 30-minute remote interview; 60-minute remote or face-to-face interview, depending on location. I have hired successfully from Hacker News before.<p>We have ambitious plans to grow quickly in an environment where data is sensitive, so any experience of scaling, security and robustness would be helpful. Any experience of start-ups and medical information systems would also be useful, but is not essential.<p>Please apply by sending your C.V. to me, with a short paragraph about why you would be a good fit for the role. Feel free to contact me with any questions. paul.redman at bookmyscan etc.","time":1533218935,"type":"comment"}
