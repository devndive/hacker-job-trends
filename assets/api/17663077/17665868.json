Our market is niche so we’ll never go public i.e. we don&#x27;t promise equity worth paper millions. Instead, we provide a supportive small team environment where your work will have a measurable impact, competitive salary &amp; benefits, and that great feeling that your work matters because it is improving the worlds’ libraries and schools (we are international, with client institutions in 80 countries). Come and help us grow – slow but steady.<p>5+ years professional experience with PHP or Angular, or both, is required. Experience in OOP&#x2F;MVC concepts is a must, too.<p>You must be highly productive working remotely as we&#x27;re a remote team. We’d prefer if you live in one of these states - NY, CA, FL, PA, MA, or KY. If you’re international, the working hours must overlap significantly with US working hours.
