We’re on a mission to improve childcare in London, and looking for someone experienced, creative &amp; friendly to join the team as our fourth full stack engineer.<p>We’re building a marketplace that enables families to find and share high quality nannies. As an engineer on the Koru Kids team, you’ll be designing and building tech to make complex matching problems a breeze, to give families and nannies a solution that just works, and to supercharge our nanny recruitment and training processes.<p>You’ll be working in Ruby for most of the backend, with Rails, PostgreSQL and Redis making up the majority of our core product. You’ll be using modern frontend tooling, with ES6 and Tachyons. When it comes to shipping code, you’ll be sending pull requests and doing code reviews in GitHub, and checking that CircleCI is happy before anything goes live. You’ll mostly be deploying to Heroku, with some heavy lifting on AWS. (That said, our priority is making sure we’re using the right tools for the job and we’re open to adding to or changing up our tech and tooling as appropriate.)<p>We’re looking a mid-level or experienced generalist or backend web developer who thrives in small, fast-moving engineering teams.<p>If this sounds interesting, you can read more &amp; apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;korukids.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;4ECE2E94E8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;korukids.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;4ECE2E94E8</a> or email me directly at michael [at] korukids.co.uk<p>Thanks for reading!","time":1533139454,"type":"comment"}
