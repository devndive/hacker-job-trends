We know at a high level what we need to do to achieve HIPAA compliance, but want a consultant with enough experience around HIPAA that they can be interpreting certain high-level requirements into action items as far as changing our AWS infrastructure without us burning ourselves from interpreting something incorrectly. Having node.js experience (and interest on backend code-writing) is an optional plus.<p>We have an existing infrastructure that will require config tweaks (like adding encryption at rest to some services), expanding the logging capability, expanding alerting, and a few other to-dos.<p>Open to working with people in U.S. or India timezones.
