We have the good fortune of starting from a clean slate (i.e., no legacy code) and are able to use the latest and greatest frameworks and tools.<p>We are actively working on our first product, a banking app for the freelance&#x2F;gig economy workforce.  We&#x27;ve chosen to use Flutter as our mobile framework and are ideally looking for someone with actual Flutter experience.  Given it is a new framework, we are of course willing to talk to folks with real world mobile experience on iOS and&#x2F;or Android (hopefully both).<p>Our backend is Scala&#x2F;Akka running at AWS.<p>Our strong preference is to have an on-site developer, but we are willing to contemplate remote arrangements for exceptional candidates.  In this case, travel to our Pittsburgh headquarters would be required (and frequent in the beginning).<p>If interested, please apply using link above - I review the applications personally.  Please note in the cover letter you saw this in Hacker News.<p>-Doug Donohoe\nCTO, numo","time":1533140919,"type":"comment"}
