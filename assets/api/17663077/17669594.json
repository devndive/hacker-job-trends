But deploying models in production, at scale is hard - there are significant infrastructure overheads. Data scientists are forced to use low-level AWS&#x2F;GCP services to build their deployment workflows. We’ve set out to make this is easy, impactful. rorodata makes it easy to go from idea to deployment quickly, users can scale as they grow.<p>Our goal is let data scientists focus on core business problem and abstract out the infrastructure.<p>While the underlying technology is key, we spend good amount of time designing for good developer experience. We work with the PyData stack on Kubernetes. So looking for engineers with good understating of Python and Unix for platform development roles.<p>We’re also looking for Python-based web developers for application development roles.<p>I&#x27;m one of the founders and would love to hear from you at raghav@rorodata.com.","time":1533191119,"type":"comment"}
