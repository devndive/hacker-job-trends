From fragmented data that causes these medical errors to impractical IT solutions that never get adopted, healthcare is broken.<p>CareEvolution is committed to helping fix healthcare with a patients-first philosophy and pragmatic, interoperable solutions that create better patient outcomes by modernizing—and connecting—health IT systems.<p>There are many interesting, exciting, and challenging things to work on at CareEvolution, including mobile (iOS and Android), web, platform, integration, devops, analytics, ETL…and more. This is a place where you have a say in what you work on in support of our mission to solve healthcare’s most complex problems.<p>We&#x27;re a small team—under 100 people (the majority are technical)—but our platform manages health data for over 100 million people.
