We&#x27;re growing quickly, with 85MM registered members, and are mostly self-funded to 120+ employees, so we&#x27;re highly focused on data-driven decisions and making smart capacity investments for the future. We&#x27;re one of Boston Business Journal&#x27;s Best Places to Work (again!).<p>Recruiting for multiple roles, especially:<p>Full-stack engineer (especially principal&#x2F;senior level) - Build all our member-facing and employer-facing applications including Jobcase.com, working mostly in Ruby on Rails, maybe some Vue.js. Drive the experience for member acquisition, social network features, and new employer features, working closely with product management and design&#x2F;UX. Expertise in scaling both technology and team processes highly desirable.<p>Quantitative data analyst - Own a slice of our business metrics and drive member acquisition and engagement. Send email&#x2F;SMS communications, work with engineering to build new flows and features, and come up with experiments to optimize the member experience.<p>Interview process is a phone screen, then onsite interviews, with onsite design exercise and&#x2F;or take-home coding&#x2F;analysis exercise. Happy to answer questions, jberk at jobcase.com - my team works pretty closely with all of those teams.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jobcase.com&#x2F;locations&#x2F;4Od3KKqq7pBUVSLdOt5YCwfo&#x2F;nzrsagNgjg18QzdOKcLpbpvq&#x2F;jobcase-cambridge-201-broadway&#x2F;apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jobcase.com&#x2F;locations&#x2F;4Od3KKqq7pBUVSLdOt5YCwfo&#x2F;nz...</a>","time":1533152352,"type":"comment"}
