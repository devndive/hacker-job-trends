We&#x27;re a small team that&#x27;s responsible for managing monetization for thousands of publishers and handling billions of requests a day. Rather than doing standard banner ads we allow publishers to create unique ad slots that complement their design and not disrupting the user experience. We&#x27;re growing quickly and tackling a wide range of problems - ranging from migrating an information-rich Angular application to React, making our data pipeline real time, to running the quickest and most efficient  real time bidding auctions.<p>If interested or just want to learn more please email me at dgoldin@triplelift.com and I&#x27;d be glad to chat more.
