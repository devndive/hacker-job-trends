We want to see people spend time on what makes their app unique and interesting, not on packaging. We also understand that developers currently face an impossible choice between few updates to lower the risk of breakage and frequent updates to lower the risk of compromise.<p>The open position is for a Senior Software Engineer. We want someone with years of war stories building developer tools to help re-architect the core of Snapcraft (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;snapcore&#x2F;snapcraft\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;snapcore&#x2F;snapcraft</a>). It needs to integrate deep into Python, Node, Ruby, Electron, and others so that releasing your app for tens of millions of Linux users is a natural extension of setup.py or npm run.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;canonical&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;1067097\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;canonical&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;1067097</a>","time":1533144582,"type":"comment"}
