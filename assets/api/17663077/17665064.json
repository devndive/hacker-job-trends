The Senior Software Engineer will be joining an accomplished team to help build out a green-field project -- a new product line for our company.<p>Our team of engineers is building out a scalable, distributed machine learning and data science platform with tight integrations and pipelines to a distributed, sharded GPU-powered database. This means the product would need to be developed in Linux and operate inside containers (Docker for us), work in a container-orchestrated environment (Kubernetes for us), operate in a scalable resource managed system (GPUs via Kubernetes) and interact with complex analytical systems (TensorFlow, etc.) Some of this, you’ll already be familiar with, and some of it we’ll learn along the way.<p>The Senior Software Engineer would work closely with the Product Owner to build out the product in Python and integrate all other parts (TensorFlow, Kubernetes, and our GPU-powered DB) using Python bindings to build and deliver an overall product (a REST API.) This role focuses on the backend and will interface with our front-end engineers who will write a ReactJS application atop the REST API.","time":1533146258,"type":"comment"}
