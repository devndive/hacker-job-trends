We use pretty cutting-edge tech (React, React Native, TypeScript, Node, GraphQL), but we&#x27;re more interested in engineering chops than any particular tech skills.<p>I&#x27;ve been here since the beginning (over two years now). The team has grown quickly, but we still have a tight-knit and incredibly smart group of engineers. We have an endless supply of interesting problems including machine learning, service architecture, mobile&#x2F;desktop&#x2F;web UX, complicated business modeling, and much more.<p>Some of our backers include Y Combinator (Continuity Fund), the founders of Amazon and Microsoft, and Greylock Partners.
