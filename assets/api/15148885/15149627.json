We make it dramatically faster and easier for great companies to hire great people. Our mission is not just to fix hiring, but to fundamentally change the way that human mental effort is allocated.<p>As part of the most recent YC S17 batch, over the past 3 months we grew our revenue 20x (to over $1.1M in annual run rate) with only 3 engineers, and last week raised millions from some great investors at one of the highest ever valuations coming out of YC (not yet announced). One founder previously sold a company and is a published machine learning researcher; the other was Chief of Staff at Dropbox, and many on our team are from other great organizations (Google, MIT, McKinsey)<p>We have a real business, customers, revenue, crazy growth, funding--and a ton of work to do. We have interesting machine learning problems that are core to our product, and a laundry list of high-leverage features for you to work on :)<p>Position: Python Engineer (senior and junior positions open)<p>Our stack: Python (Django, nltk), AWS (S3, PostgreSQL), Javascript (React)<p>Qualifications:<p>- Do you love programming, working with a scrappy team, and shipping tons of code quickly?\n- Are you interested in solving real ML problems and collecting more data than Github, Twitter and StackOverflow combined?\n- Are you empathetic, highly systematic, intensely driven, and intellectually curious?\n- Do you care about improvement at both the individual and global scale?<p>Then at least say hi :)<p>email: josh@sourceress.com","time":1504281600,"type":"comment"}
