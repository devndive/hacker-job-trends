We are an internet-scale Library of Alexandria, a place where people go to learn about anything and share everything they know. At Quora, we use Machine Learning in almost every part of the product - feed ranking, answer ranking, search, topic and user recommendations, spam detection etc. Within the past few months we released a large duplicate question dataset [1], built out Quora on Alexa and Google Home [2] and linked Quora Topics to Wikidata [3]. As a Machine Learning expert, you will have a unique opportunity to have high impact by advancing these systems, as well as uncovering new opportunities to apply Machine Learning to the Quora product. As a ML Infrastructure Expert, you will play a key role in developing tools and abstractions that our other developers would build on top of.<p>Machine Learning Engineers: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2lTPGM2\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2lTPGM2</a><p>ML Infrastructure Engineers: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2lzaLZz\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2lzaLZz</a><p>Product Infrastructure Engineer: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2mtz4fJ\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2mtz4fJ</a><p>And more! quora.com&#x2F;careers<p>Please submit online at the link above and mention my HN user name.\n[1] data.quora.com&#x2F;First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs\n[2] blog.quora.com&#x2F;Introducing-Quora-on-Voice\n[3] blog.quora.com&#x2F;Announcing-Wikidata-References-on-Topics","time":1504278587,"type":"comment"}
