We&#x27;re growing quickly and have some really exciting things in the pipeline.<p>Hiring at mid and senior level for various roles - we&#x27;re heavy on micro-services and data science, plus the other obligatory buzzwords like big data and machine learning. Our stack tends to be Node, Python and Java (depending on the context) and React on the front-end.<p>I&#x27;ve worked here for five months now and I really think it&#x27;s a great place to work. There are some great projects to work on, the offices are really cool, the people are very smart (and friendly), and I even get to work on open source!<p>My referral link is at the top of this post, but feel free to email me at shaun.donnelly[at]skyscanner.net if you&#x27;d like me to refer you, or if you&#x27;d like to ask anything about the company, roles available or what sort of stuff you&#x27;d be working on.<p>We only do onsite roles right now, but relocation and visa assistance is available if needed.","time":1504297793,"type":"comment"}
