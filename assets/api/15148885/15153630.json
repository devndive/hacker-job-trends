It’s the only way for companies (big and small) to integrate with 90% of Fortune 1000 companies and their tens of thousands of suppliers. But EDI software hasn&#x27;t changed in a decade. We&#x27;re eliminating the enormous complexity and cost of implementing and managing EDI by building a simple, intuitive interface - basically, &#x27;Stripe for EDI.&#x27;<p>We’re looking for a senior backend engineer with a ton of experience on any JVM language. We’re building on AWS’s serverless stack (Lambda, API Gateway, SNS, SQS, RDS, etc).
