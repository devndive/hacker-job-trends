This was our original plan but we&#x27;re currently pivoting to a more general service software and could use an extra hand.<p>Bootstrapped lifestyle business, no intention to go to VCs or outside for funding.<p>Looking for a 3rd partner&#x2F;founder who is familiar with: \n- jQuery, Ruby on Rails, Postgres, Heroku (most important, - Ruby on Rails and jQuery).\n- design experience is a plus.\n- able to work part time (~20 hrs&#x2F;wk).<p>Equity only (amount negotiable). This is a good opportunity for anyone looking to gain experience with the possibility of escaping the rat race. We have found a small product market fit but will know a lot more of our direction in the next couple months.<p>Email me at Amar (at) ZenMaid.com if interested or you want to find out more.<p>Thanks!","time":1385928967,"type":"comment"}
