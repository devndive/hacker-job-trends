We’re all about high-performance JavaScript. We have a team dedicated to measuring the performance of every build.<p>Our challenges include:<p>* completely removing ActiveX from the enterprise medical world.<p>* Writing our own, faster versions of common JavaScript UI libraries.<p>* Writing JavaScript that runs on one window, and manipulates the DOM on another. Did you know that, in IE, you can’t invoke a constructor defined on one window from code loaded in another?<p>* Creating real-time messaging systems between browser windows, desktop apps, and servers across a large geographically distributed facility.<p>* Sharing the single JavaScript thread in a an N-window N<i>M widget application.<p></i> Hitting aggressive cold and warm start times.<p>We’re still building the first version, a performant MVP, but when we start V2, there will be plenty of new challenges like writing 3D image viewers in NaCL and using WebGL and Canvas to display interactive radiological images.<p>Send me an email if you are interested: fuji@beechtreetech.com","time":1385919941,"type":"comment"}
