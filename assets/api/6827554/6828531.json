Our systems are written on the LAMP stack and deployed on Amazon Web Services; we are migrating to Symfony 2 as our MVC framework. Developers choose the tools that work best for them - for instance, at the moment we have a mix of Linux and Mac workstations in the team. We are adopting and adapting agile development techniques such as test-driven development, pair programming, and continuous integration. We hold regular retrospectives to improve our working environment and lightning talks to share cool ideas whether work-related or not. Our developers are generalizing specialists whose typical day may include refining an algorithm, writing a tricky integration test, tuning a SQL query, and discussing feature nuances with a product manager. Our team is growing fast and we&#x27;d like to hear (at careers@secretsales.com) from any of you who&#x27;d like to join us; we&#x27;re hiring for all technical roles.<p>Established in London in July 2007, Secretsales.com is one of the UK&#x27;s leading private shopping clubs, offering limited-time online sales with current name-brand goods at deep discounts.
