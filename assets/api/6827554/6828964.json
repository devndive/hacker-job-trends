Our first product, a programming tool, will be released on Jan 14th, 2014. We&#x27;re looking for someone to come in and help us write the next edition which is due a year later. You will find our project interesting if you understand music, enjoy teaching and write programs. Our product incorporates concepts from music (rhythm) and is designed to be literate (see Donald Knuth). We have an in-house recording studio where we experiment with sound. We have access to local musicians of which there are many in Allahabad.<p>Email: rohit@khitchdee.com","time":1385928072,"type":"comment"}
