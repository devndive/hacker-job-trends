We&#x27;re looking for C and C++ folks who also are experienced with electronics.  We work on some seriously cool new technology.  Automobiles are rapidly increasing cockpit technology with more advanced center stack displays and clusters.  You may also get to do a bit of robotics as some of our software controls needles and dials too.","time":1385918163,"type":"comment"}
