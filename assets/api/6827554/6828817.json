We’re a young startup, but we’re profitable, we’re growing fast, and we have wildly positive feedback from tens of thousands of students who have successfully used our applications to study for the GRE, GMAT, and SAT (more coming soon!)<p>Our technology includes Ruby on Rails, AWS, native iOS&#x2F;Android, and AngularJS. You don’t need prior experience with any of these (it’s a plus, of course), just solid coding skills and a desire to build 5-star applications.<p><a href=\"http://magoosh.com/jobs/junior-developer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;magoosh.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;junior-developer&#x2F;</a>","time":1385926399,"type":"comment"}
