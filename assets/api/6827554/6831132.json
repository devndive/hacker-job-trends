We are backed by top tier VC&#x27;s and are one of the few consumer startups in the area that take design seriously (we&#x27;ve been living in IDEO for the last 4 months and just moved into our own office last week).<p><a href=\"https://www.pillpack.com/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pillpack.com&#x2F;careers</a><p>Send an email to tj at pillpack.com if you&#x27;re interested or want to find out more about us &#x2F; what we&#x27;re looking for.","time":1385952457,"type":"comment"}
