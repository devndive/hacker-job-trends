We&#x27;ve put together a killer team across web, infrastructure, android, design, support, but iOS is still open. We would love someone strong enough to lead a team that should grow to 3-4 in the next 6-9 months.<p>Quizlet helps students practice what they&#x27;re learning. Students absolutely adore us, just read the twitter search for Quizlet. Quizlet is a top 100 Website in the U.S. (20m uniques&#x2F;mo), and during school our current iOS app is always in the top 2-3 for education. We are one of the few education companies succeeded in going directly to students, as opposed to selling through schools and districts. We have big plans for building learning tools that truly empower kids and make them enjoy the learning process.<p>Applications to jobs@quizlet.com","time":1385922901,"type":"comment"}
