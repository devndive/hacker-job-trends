Over 44% of college graduates work in jobs that don&#x27;t require a college degree, but employers still can&#x27;t find quality talent. We introduce the human element into real-world, skills-based online education. Students complete rigorous curriculums created by our partner companies that focus on teaching the skills that employers need. Our industry-based mentors ensure that students receive the support that they need to learn.<p>Our Story<p>We were born out of two acquired startups and still retain the culture and practices of a lean &#x2F; agile startup, but have all the resources and benefits of a public company (our parent company, Apollo Education Group, made over 3.5 billion in revenue last year). We’re a young company looking for people looking to help shape our culture.<p>Our Team<p>We’re a diverse team made of:\n- A Bonnaroo Guitarist\n- The world’s preeminent scholar on Toilet Based Social Networks\n- A philosopher king with a sweet spot for ice cream<p>Our engineers write pristine, well-tested code. We pride ourselves in developer happiness. SkilledUp uses a pull request based workflow, continuous integration. We think Ruby on Rails, Trello, Github, and Heroku are the best tools. We have continuous investment days, where we only focus on learning new skills.<p>If you are interested in learning more and want to talk to an engineer, send an email to jon@skilledup.com","time":1406910196,"type":"comment"}
