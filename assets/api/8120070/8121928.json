If you&#x27;re on the software side, work on a modern software stack (amusingly, that&#x27;s a rarity in the networking world), and hack on incredibly distributed systems approaching ridiculous scaling requirements, mostly in C++&#x2F;Python. The hardware side builds some of the meanest and most efficient boxes out thereâ€”the things that they churn out of their workshop never ceases to amaze me.<p>In any case, we&#x27;re constantly shipping code, genuinely working to improve the state-of-the-art, changing the entire networking industry, and making money while doing it (See: $ANET). It&#x27;s a pretty fun time - come check us out at <a href=\"http://www.arista.com/en/careers/engineering\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arista.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;careers&#x2F;engineering</a><p>Feel free to ask me any questions, too (contact info in my profile).","time":1406917094,"type":"comment"}
