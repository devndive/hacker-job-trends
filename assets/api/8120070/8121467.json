Not only is the core infrastructure built with technology from the 1970s, but when is the last time you hard someone say say &quot;I trust my bank to look out for me&quot;.  It doesn’t have to be this way, and it’s our mission to fix this problem. We are using technology to re-imagine and re-build core parts of financial infrastructure to enable cheaper, friendlier and more transparent financial products and services that improve lives and return the financial service industry back to its roots: value creation as opposed to value extraction.<p>We are based in San Francisco and are founded and backed by industry veterans, including Max Levchin, (Affirm CEO, PayPal cofounder&#x2F;CTO) and Nathan Gettings, (Affirm Chief Risk Officer, Palantir cofounder&#x2F;CTO). We are looking for exceptionally talented and passionate people who believe in our mission and want to be a part of shaping the future of consumer finance.<p>We&#x27;re looking for full-stack engineers, infrastructure engineers, UX engineers, and iOS and Android engineers, in addition to some non-technical roles as well. Our backend is written in Python and lives on AWS.<p>Email me at naftali@affirm.com or apply at <a href=\"https://www.affirm.com/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.affirm.com&#x2F;careers</a>.<p>FULL-TIME, INTERN, VISA, LOCAL, RELOCATION, NO REMOTE","time":1406912649,"type":"comment"}
