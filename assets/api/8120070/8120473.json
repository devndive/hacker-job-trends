If you check out our examples[0], you&#x27;ll be surprised on how easy it is to fill them out.<p>We&#x27;re constantly trying to find developers that have an attitude of learning new things, fixing bugs in a good way together with refactoring and to improve our platform. Your work will be highly independent which requires you to have a high level of architecture design and also be able to work without something telling you exactly how to implement something.<p>We work mainly with PHP (Symfony2 mostly) and JavaScript (Backbone mostly) but that is not a hard requirement. Most important that you have determination and a drive to learn more about the stuff you work with.<p>We require you to speak english and to come to our office and work.<p>Email me personally at victor@typeform.com, send an email to jobs@typeform.com or fill out this form for us to be able to speak with you more: <a href=\"https://jobs.typeform.com/to/e7NNgU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.typeform.com&#x2F;to&#x2F;e7NNgU</a><p>[0] - <a href=\"http://www.typeform.com/use-cases/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.typeform.com&#x2F;use-cases&#x2F;</a>","time":1406906718,"type":"comment"}
