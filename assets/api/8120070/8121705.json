We are building a Saas product used by CRM marketers to intelligently automate behavioral messaging in a way that drives superior customer engagement and revenue. Blueshift is founded by repeat entrepreneurs who previously built Mertado (YC Winter 2010, acquired by Groupon) and were a part of the early team behind Kosmix (acquired by Walmart to become @WalmartLabs). We are backed by top tier VC firms, and are in pilots with select high growth customers.<p>We are hiring for data science, front-end engineer, and product design roles.<p>If you are interested, send us an email at jobs@getblueshift.com","time":1406914796,"type":"comment"}
