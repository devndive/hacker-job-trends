Our founders created the company with a passion to build storage technology customers love and deliver it with simplicity and service that fundamentally changes the enterprise storage experience.  With over $470 million in funding from some of the most prominent venture capitalists, our record revenue growth and impressive margins have landed us a valuation of over $3 billion.<p>Our products are faster than legacy storage, much simpler to manage and much more environmentally friendly, consuming only 10% of the power and rack space of the traditional refrigerator-size, disk-based atrocities.<p>With a virtually unlimited budget for great talent, weâ€™re looking for passionate top-notch engineers to join the rocket ship that is Pure Storage and help us continue to build the next great, lasting, enterprise company.<p>--<p>Now my personal comments :)<p>Emphasis on C or C++ is a good thing; the core software is written in C++ and we do a lot of linux kernel work. This is the most sophisticated product I&#x27;ve ever worked on; we have a combination of cutting edge software design, truly awesome features to get the most out of our flash, and a dedication to data integrity that cannot be matched.","time":1406905237,"type":"comment"}
