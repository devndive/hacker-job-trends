We provide real-time push alerts, news, and scores to our users. We reached 5.5 million users this quarter (up 33% compared to last year&#x27;s quarter) and we need more awesome people like you to keep it scaling up! I could go on, but it seems like that would take too much time. Check out the website[0] or contact me through twitter (@Nitrodist).<p>You would be working on the team that processes and provides data to our mobile and web clients (mostly Android, iOS, and an Ember app).<p>Our stack is basically this:<p>* Ruby (some sinatra and non-rails focused projects)<p>* Rails (a lot of projects)<p>* Python (one project)<p>* Angular (one project)<p>If you understand the importance of caching, have heard of Varnish, have used HAProxy, etc., we want to hear from you! If you&#x27;ve worked in distributed systems before, we want to hear from you!<p>Working here is pretty awesome... things off the top of my head that are great about this place:<p>* Personal top-of-the-line Macbook Pro and Thunderbolt display<p>* Foosball, ping pong, TF2 Fridays, beer, FIFA 14 (PS4) and Mario Kart 8<p>* Outdoor patio<p>* Watch sports games (liking sports is not a requirement!)<p>* We are publicly traded and make money[1]<p>If you&#x27;re interested or want more details, hit me up with an email (mark.campbell@thescore.com) or tweet me (@Nitrodist).
