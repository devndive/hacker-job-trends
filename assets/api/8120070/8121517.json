It could be a great fit and a best of both worlds (stability and innovation). If you are thinking, you should consider us. Here&#x27;s why:<p><i>We were a team of 4 acquired by Weight Watchers International, a brand recognized by almost everyone, including our moms.<p></i>We are left alone to build new products for WW and have some interesting products we are working on.<p><i>We have to worry less about stability, legal and other non-technical stuff and can focus on doing what we love.<p></i>We offer competitive compensation and great health benefits.<p>All 4 of us are staying and now growing. We just hired our intern full-time! We love what we do and believe in our mission to make people healthier. We have diverse backgrounds (Stanford, Bain, Google, Netflix) and we are looking for you to come join and teach us new tricks!<p>If you are interested, email me at amol@wello.com and we can catch up over phone or coffee.","time":1406913152,"type":"comment"}
