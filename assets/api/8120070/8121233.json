We&#x27;ve been the #1 app in Russia, China, Israel and Singapore and are violently growing.<p>We only hire builders and artists.<p>We are looking for another master iOS engineer to add to our team, and also frontend and backend engineers. We have massive scale and develop primarily in Java, Go, and Python.<p>We surround ourselves with people that make us better. We&#x27;re not looking for people who count the hours at the office, but those who lose track of time in what they do best. We&#x27;re building a product we truly love and want to build a team full of people who also love what they create every day.
