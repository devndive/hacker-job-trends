We are a small but experienced team (only 4 devs counting the CEO) of startup veterans (Amazon, Etsy, Daily Candy) with previous exits.  We are growing extremely quickly.<p>We are hiring across the stack, looking for people with solid CS fundamentals who are comfortable working on any part of the stack but specialize in one (front end, backend, devops etc.).  This is a job that entails moving money around, so payments experience is great, but regardless you should be comfortable with the challenges that come with being responsible for customers&#x27; bank accounts and social security numbers.  We are a rails shop, but don&#x27;t require that you know rails or even ruby before coming here (I didn&#x27;t and I turned out just fine).<p>We&#x27;re especially looking for senior level people who are opinionated about their technology and the way their team works.  We want people who want to contribute to the engineering culture of the team and are excited to help build a world class engineering team.","time":1406906033,"type":"comment"}
