We will embed function into the typical shapes of 3D printing. Our materials, based on research by Harvard SEAS Professor Jennifer Lewis, allow us to print embedded conductors, wires, and batteries into the normal matrix materials of 3D printing.<p>We are looking for both senior and junior software developers to help us with a variety of tasks needed to get our hardware product to market.<p>We are currently working on a new slicer written in Julia. We use the Marlin firmware running on an Arduino to control our printer. We will need to develop mobile applications to communicate with and control the hardware. We also need to develop new CAD software to allow our users to design objects using our unique materials capabilities. This means we are looking for people interested in:<p>* 3D printing&#x2F;3D Scanning<p>* Computation geometry<p>* Embedded systems<p>* Mobile development<p>* CAD Software (possiby Three.js&#x2F;WebGL based)<p>* Closed loop control systems<p>* Python, Julia, Javascript, C, GL<p>Bonus points for people interested in software, hardware, and materials science.<p>If more than one of the above sounds interesting, please reach out to me!
