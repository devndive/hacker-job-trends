Arduino-compatible, ARM-powered with 1 kilometer range and encryption. Mesh networking and cloud back-end coming soon. We love hardware.<p>We&#x27;re currently finishing up hardware development for delivery of our Kickstarter, and would like to expand our team to develop our core platform. Connected devices &amp; Internet of Things is a quickly growing market sector, and we&#x27;re looking for a few skilled engineers who&#x27;d like to help us expand. Our current plan is to build up our core platform and focus on our general purpose dev hardware, likely with a focus on sensor networks. The field is pretty wide open so we want to use sales of our current hardware to determine where to go next.<p>People we could use:<p>-Embedded Engineer who knows ARM and&#x2F;or wireless sensor networks.<p>-Back end web engineer for a cloud data relay.<p>-Front end web developer.<p>-Mobile developers for Apple and Android.<p>-Electrical engineer for hardware layout.<p>-Angel Investors interested in Internet of Things who can also actively advise.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, go outside and shout really loudly, or send an email to taylor |at| flutterwireless dot com","time":1406922325,"type":"comment"}
