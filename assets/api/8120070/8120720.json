We serve about 2 billion of transactions per day with super low latency through our online advertising platform. At that scale, every contribution to our platform can have a huge impact.<p>We hack on C, Scala, Rails, Redis, Hadoop, HBase and Postgres.  We do data analysis with Hive and R.  We&#x27;re likely to get into Spark and Storm in the near future. We don&#x27;t expect you to be an expert in any of these technologies. In fact, I joined the team as a dyed-in-the-wool .NET guy. More than anything we&#x27;re looking for the right kind of can-do folks who thrive on building solid systems.<p>We offer a competitive salary, paid lunch, medical&#x2F;dental, and uncapped vacation.  We work a modified schedule to give us every other Friday off.<p>Maybe you know Rails but you&#x27;ve been wanting to learn Scala. Maybe you&#x27;ve tinkered with Kafka&#x2F;Storm on a few EC2 instances but never had a chance to work with a ton of data.  Maybe you&#x27;ve wanted to gain deep knowledge of the online advertising industry.  We want you. You&#x27;ll be joining a sharp team with a strong appetite for progress.<p>I&#x27;m one of the engineers, and I&#x27;d be happy to chat about our team even if you don&#x27;t have a resume or consider yourself actively looking for a new gig. If you&#x27;d prefer to jump directly into the HR channel, I can connect you with the right folks. Email david.larsen@connexity.com.","time":1406908367,"type":"comment"}
