We&#x27;re still small enough (around 30 total employees) that you can get to know most everyone in the company, including the owner&#x2F;president and our crazy-smart developers.<p>You can find our full job listings here:<p><a href=\"http://www.nowintelligence.com/careers/join/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nowintelligence.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;join&#x2F;</a><p>Who I am:<p>I&#x27;m a senior software developer and a recent hire myself, with a specialization in web development.
