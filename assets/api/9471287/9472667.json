{"by":"Sidnicious","id":9472667,"parent":9471287,"text":"OkCupid | NYC (local only)<p>We’re a team of ~30 in charge of the best free dating website in the world. If you work here, you&#x27;ll have tons of responsibility and flexibility in the kinds of problems you work on. Some of us focus on improving matching and looking at data, others on performance and our open-source C++ web server, others on writing modern frontend code for new and rewritten features. We&#x27;re looking for a few kinds of experienced people:<p>- Software engineers to work on a mix of the site backend, matching system, web server, and data analysis. You&#x27;ll write mostly C++ and Python, but it&#x27;s okay if you don&#x27;t know them yet.<p>- Web developers to work on our next-generation mobile site. Experience or interest in Angular, and experience with mobile browsers, are plusses.<p>- An iOS developer to take the lead on our iPhone and Apple Watch apps. If you&#x27;ve ever used an iPhone app and thought, &quot;I could make this so much better,” we should talk. Our app is a custom web&#x2F;native hybrid so if you&#x27;re interested in working on the web parts too, that&#x27;s even better.<p>Benefits include great coworkers, monthly happy hours (optional), and whatever hardware you want.<p>We&#x27;re also looking for an experienced product designer and sysadmin (two jobs, not one).
