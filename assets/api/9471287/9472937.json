We&#x27;re on a mission to take the power out of the hand of recruitment agencies and eliminate waste from the NHS by freeing up the data.<p>Our technology stack comprises mainly of interconnected microservices in Python and Django communicating over Redis, with some Angular.js giving our front-end a bit of dazzle. It’s quite cool.<p>What we believe in * Getting stuff done * Testing quickly and often * Making informed, data-driven decisions * Lean principles and Agile + Scrum project management * Developers spending their time doing what they do best: developing * Cultural fit is as important as raw technical skills are<p>We have an office in Shoreditch which our team of 12 works out of. If you’d like to join us and be challenged on a daily basis, while having fun with great people, then shoot us your github profile to michael@networklocum.com","time":1430500069,"type":"comment"}
