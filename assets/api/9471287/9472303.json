We do a lot of analysis and optimization, too. We’re working in the largest, least sexy, most invisible industry in the world — 90% of everything has been on a ship at one point in time. The problem -&gt; Lots of inefficiencies in the supply chain! One of our customers spends $400mm&#x2F;year shipping empty containers, another spends $80mm&#x2F;year on late fees. Lots to optimize! How we fix it -&gt; We track everything in the supply chain and make predictions and recommendations as to what our customers should do!<p><pre><code>   ===========================\n   ===== How we do it ========\n   ===========================\n</code></pre>\nWeb&#x2F;data stack -&gt; clojure&#x2F;scala&#x2F;python + postgis&#x2F;redshift&#x2F;redis&#x2F;rabbit + ruby on rails + hadoop&#x2F;EMR&#x2F;Spark&#x2F;Docker (we’re a SOA shop)<p>Mobile -&gt; iOS, android, mobile web<p>Algorithms -&gt; a dizzying mixture of oldschool and newschool techniques... think ML, Neuro-AI modeling, and statistics<p><pre><code>   ===========================\n   ====== And the rest =======\n   ===========================\n</code></pre>\nWe&#x27;ve got some very interesting partners and customers (ranging from CPG companies and telcos to enterprise software providers to regional and international logistics companies).
