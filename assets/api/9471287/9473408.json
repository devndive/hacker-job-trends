We think the farm management system is broken, and that we can use contextual awareness and data science to automate much of the system for farmers, and fit it into their natural workflow. Leaf is focused on two things: strengthening the spirit of farming and the sustainability of the farm.<p>We were founded by Stanford Alumni with decades of industry experience, and are on pace to be cash flow positive within our first 6 months.<p>We are hiring frontend (Javascript), backend (Python w&#x2F; some Go projects in the works + Postgresql), iOS (primarily Swift), and full-stack engineers! We are four full-time engineers right now, and in a paid beta with some truly awesome farms!<p>Email us at joeyr@leaf.ag","time":1430503943,"type":"comment"}
