We&#x27;re Nylas and we&#x27;re looking for help building the next generation email platform. We&#x27;re building a missing piece of Internet infrastructure and are looking for frontend application engineers and designers and backend systems and infrastructure&#x2F;operations engineers to join us.<p>Companies are building their core businesses around our email API right now, and that means we have to be reliable, up all the time, and fast. We have more data for a single user than in most startups&#x27; entire database. We&#x27;re scaling heavily and if you have experience with automated deployments, debugging running systems, release engineering, and on-call schedules, but are still comfortable writing code, this job might be for you. :)<p>Many people spend their entire days buried in mail clients which haven&#x27;t significantly changed in years. Yet have you ever met anyone who really loves their email experience? We want to change that. We&#x27;re building a frontend framework to power the next generation of mail apps. Sound exciting to you? Apply here.<p>== We&#x27;re particularly looking for folks who ==<p>* Take personal pride in their work and value autonomy and ownership.<p>* Want the chance to step up and lead a team.<p>* Put the work before ego. We&#x27;ve got each others&#x27; backs, and we want you to be with us on that.<p>== A bit more about us ==<p>* Our backend is built on tools like Python, Flask, gevent, nginx, MySQL, AWS, and Debian. We&#x27;ve been careful to keep our architecture componentized.<p>* Our frontend projects use Coffeescript, React, (Re)Flux, SQL for offline caching, Electron (Atom Shell), and no jQuery.<p>* Tons of our code is open source. Check it out: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nylas\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nylas</a><p>* We&#x27;re 40% women on our team of 13 (12 engineers), including 1 of 2 cofounders. We want to make that number 50%.<p>* We have an open vacation policy and value personal responsibility and ownership. Benefits include full health, dental, vision, commuter, and lunch at the office every day. Some remote work &#x2F; work-from-home is OK too.<p>Apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nylas.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nylas.com&#x2F;jobs</a>. Include a cover letter letting us know what draws you to the job. We welcome and encourage applications from women, LQBTQ folks, and people of color. (We even have some already on the team!)","time":1430498382,"type":"comment"}
