We are building powerful online advertising tools that everyone can use — not just big brands and agencies. We are growing incredibly fast — our servers handle 2000 requests per second and manage more than 700 million users (yes, that&#x27;s 20% of the internet).<p>We are looking for experienced front-end developers and full-stack engineers. We use Angular&#x2F;JavaScript (ES6) on the front end, and Java&#x2F;Cassandra&#x2F;Kafka&#x2F;Storm&#x2F;Redis on the back end.<p>Feel free to ping me anytime at engineering@unite.io.","time":1430490968,"type":"comment"}
