RoR, Go, ElasticSearch but we think you can learn these things on the job if you&#x27;re competent. We treat employees like humans. $90k and up depending on experience.<p>We&#x27;re a Ruby on Rails shop who has recently consolidated a bunch of backend tech into Go and ElasticSearch. We would love a few engineers who would be interested in working in all three and could lend expertise to the latter two.\nWe&#x27;re generally interested in gathering information from print ads, so strategies around data entry applications or experience with computer vision is also really exciting for us.<p>Our request volume has been increasing by 10s to 100s of millions each month and we&#x27;ve had to learn a lot of new things to keep up. It&#x27;s fun and exciting times but we&#x27;re shorthanded to handle the load!<p>OwnLocal is dedicated to having a quality work environment for everyone. On our engineering team we value collaboration over competition, respect work-life balance and solve problems without blaming people. We have a &quot;no assholes&quot; policy. We have great health insurance. We&#x27;re big enough to be stable but small enough to still be startupy. We pay market rate for Austin; the lowest salary for this position is around $90k&#x2F;yr.<p>We believe that someone who is truly a senior software engineer can come from almost any background and pick up a new set of tech in a reasonable amount of time which is why we don&#x27;t list much about our tech stack in our ads.\nIf you are interested, feel free to contact us at hack@ownlocal.com.","time":1430493291,"type":"comment"}
