We are bringing the growth hacking tools that consumer Internet companies like Twitter&#x2F;Facebook build internally to other e-businesses. We aim to build the best user growth engine on the planet. It&#x27;s crazy how messaging and email usage are changing, but the technology and capabilities haven&#x27;t caught up to the 21st century. Our team of hackers and thinkers is from quant finance&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;Google, (we built large parts of Twitter&#x27;s growth systems). One of our top level goals is to build a uniquely fun and growth oriented company culture. We pair program, design together, and generally create a learn-and-teach environment here. If you&#x27;re interested in coming on board, you can help with some challenges we face:<p><pre><code>  - Scale our messaging API \n  - Design and write performant, beautiful, asynchronous interfaces \n  - Write software to build machine learned user models \n  - Make data visualizations for our email and user data \n  - Design an immutable deployment infrastructure for our platform\n</code></pre>\nSome aspects of our culture that make us different:<p><pre><code>  - We are all very focused on self improvement \n  - Our company has egalitarian and transparent values (work when you want, on what you want) \n  - We are chill and empathetic people \n  - The company is completely transparent\n</code></pre>\nTechnologies you&#x27;ll work with:<p><pre><code>  - Scala\n  - ElasticSearch\n  - Postgres\n  - Redis\n  - AngularJS\n  - Play Framework\n  - RabbitMQ\n</code></pre>\nYou&#x27;ll get to work with us at our office at 5th and Market in San Francisco.
