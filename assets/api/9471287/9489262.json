Want to see your work impact the lives of hundreds of millions of people? If so, our music engineering team at Pandora could be a fit!  This team works with the data of our 250+ million users to maintain and improve our listeners&#x27; experience. We&#x27;re backend Java engineers, are highly visible within the org, and make a direct impact on our product by partnering with our scientists and product managers analyzing huge amounts of user data. We owned Pandora&#x27;s integration with Google NOW and are generally working on interesting and exciting tech.<p>We deploy on Linux, code primarily in Java, use Python for scripting, Postgres for traditional DB and Redis for noSQL DB solution, interact with Hadoop&#x2F;Hive (so any exposure to big data tech is a plus).<p>We&#x27;re based in Oakland (and love it here) and have a very flexible remote work environment combined with a more traditional onsite setup.  A good example: the team I work on is in the office M-TH 10am-4pm and Friday is an unofficial everyone work from home day.  WFH because of kids, pets, doctors appts, etc. is normal and expected; this is not your normal clock-punch corporate environment.<p>Competitive comp, equity packages, bonus structure, good benefits, 40 hours of paid volunteer time each year, and all kinds of other work&#x2F;life oriented perks come with our full time gigs.  Happy to talk to anyone who is even remotely curious about this (or other engineering roles)!  We&#x27;re hiring!<p>Contact: adoyal@pandora.com for more info!","time":1430774226,"type":"comment"}
