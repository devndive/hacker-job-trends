With this process, instructors gain little insight into their students’ knowledge. Simply measuring the frequency of a specific mistake requires painstaking tallying. Answering the question “What concepts are my students struggling with?” is practically impossible.<p>Gradescope lets instructors give out the same paper-based assignments, but then grade them online, while keeping track of the exact mistakes made by every student on every question. This enables unprecedented data analytics: for example, we can reveal which concepts a student needs help with, or which questions are too difficult. To top it off, instructors get grading done in half the time.<p>Our product has been used to grade over 3 million pages of work belonging to over 30,000 students. We’ve raised a seed round, and are making our first full-time hires to join the founding team of two PhDs and professor from Berkeley CS. Over the next few months, we’re looking to expand our user base tenfold, and roll out advanced features including autograding, analytics, and more. We offer market-rate salary with generous equity.<p>We’re currently hiring for two positions:\nFull-stack Engineer\nUI&#x2F;UX Designer<p>If you’re interested, email jobs@gradescope.com","time":1430513506,"type":"comment"}
