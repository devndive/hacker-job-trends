With a web interface and using Raspberry Pis as print servers, our system makes it 10x easier to use and share a 3D printer. We have challenged ourselves to redefine 3D printing, making the technology accessible, and enabling entirely new applications.<p>Our users have printed thousands of times, and we are expanding the platform to connect with other services. Our main objectives are to implement a RESTful API, and scale the service internationally. PrintToPeer is primarily built with rails on AWS.<p>We were 250% successfully crowdfunded, and have funding in place for a dev hire. You will be joining two technical founders with a love of cutting edge technologies.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;printtopeer&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;printtopeer&#x2F;jobs</a> | contact me at tom[at]printtopeer[dot]com","time":1430515296,"type":"comment"}
