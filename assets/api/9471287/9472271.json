Built from billions of inputs, the data is constantly updated by Factual’s real-time data stack. We were named one of &quot;50 Disruptive Companies in 2013&quot; by MIT Technology Review. We have a terrific team that is still fairly small and an incredible CEO who was previously the co-founder of Applied Semantics (which was bought by Google and became AdSense). Factual has venture funding from Andreessen-Horowitz and our partners&#x2F;customers include Facebook, Yelp, Trulia, and Newsweek.<p>There are many challenging problems to work on at all layers of the stack: data cleaning and canonicalization, storage, deduping, serving, APIs, improving data using machine learning, etc. A great example is one of our most recent products, Geopulse Audience, which stands at the intersection of high quality places data and large scale analysis of user geo-data: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factual.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;geopulse-audience\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factual.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;geopulse-audience</a> . If you love data, Factual is the place to be.
