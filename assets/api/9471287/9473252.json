Our marketplace approach gives small businesses a fast, simple, and fair way to get the capital they need to continue to grow. We&#x27;ve lent over $1B globally, recently completed a $150MM funding round, and are investing heavily in technology.<p>We primarily develop in Clojure and Ruby (not so much Rails). We can do TN visa and H1B transfer and are focusing on growing our on-site team at the moment.<p>It would great to talk to people interested in working in Clojure(Script), React, Angular.js, and Mesos for frontend, backend, data science, or infrastructure roles to help us build a collaborative, professional, and diverse team.<p>You can reach me at rob@fundingcircle.com if you&#x27;re interested in learning more.","time":1430502797,"type":"comment"}
