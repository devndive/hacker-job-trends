Looking for people willing to work in our Santa Monica office on a regular basis, though of course hours are flexible and some working from home is great.<p>For the product owner role, experience with systems like oDesk, Uber, or online dating sites might be relevant. This is a critical role helping to bridge between several stakeholder communities (clients, workers, supply chain managers, project managers) and our development team. Some travel will probably be useful to engage with stakeholders.","time":1430515057,"type":"comment"}
