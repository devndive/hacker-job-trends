The press is pretty receptive to this idea as it solves a clear need that everyone has (everyone hates waiting on hold) but we'd love someone's help with organizing our press efforts.<p>Know anyone who's extremely organized, writes well and loves talking to new people?  Hook us up!<p>aaron*fastcustomer.com","time":1306946588,"type":"comment"}
