We have a variety of positions open on our website, but I'm particularly focused on filling a couple of spots in my group. Here's the posting:<p><pre><code>   http://exa.com/pages/company/job_postings/11_Swe_Engr_CAE_MA.html\n</code></pre>\nI manage a team of three (including me) and I'm looking to add two developers to support our rapid growth (including a couple of big upcoming projects). Note that the job description lists 5-7 years experience, but because I have two open spots, I'll likely hire one more junior candidate as well.<p>Shoot me an e-mail if you have any interest or want more details -- the e-mail in the posting (swppjobs@exa.com), will come to me.","time":1306937484,"type":"comment"}
