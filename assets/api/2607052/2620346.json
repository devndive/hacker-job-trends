Remote is fine - although we're based in London, so would be nice to say hello properly!<p>We're a boutique file hosting site, just under a month old with hundreds of thousands of hits and terabytes of data. Please note we are NOT a syncing platform like Dropbox or Box.net - that is not what we do. We are a means to get a file from point A to point B. We try to make the process simple and beautiful.<p>Looking for anyone who has experience within this domain as we really want to ramp up over the summer with more 'pro' and even enterprise solutions.<p>If you can help please hit us up at hey@castle.so<p>Thanks!","time":1307218466,"type":"comment"}
