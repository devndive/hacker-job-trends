Have also worked in Flash and Flex (AS 2 and 3), C, Haskell, Ruby, PHP and lots of others.<p>A little bit late to this one but thought I might as well post anyway. I got (and am continuing to get) some good work from some cool people last time!<p>Looking for freelance work but feel free to contact me about anything<p>Tom (at) almostobsolete.net","time":1307053281,"type":"comment"}
