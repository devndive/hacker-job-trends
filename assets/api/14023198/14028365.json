With a twinned consumer and B2B approach, Zumper built the first ever search-through-close rental platform where a renter can pull out their phone and make an instant &amp; guaranteed rental application from an open house or a tour with one tap.<p>We have over 5+ million visitors a month and have raised $39.2 million in venture capital to date from investors including Kleiner Perkins and Goodwater Capital. Our iOS and Android consumer apps were both featured at launch on the front pages of the App Store and Play Store respectively.
