The largest container vessels can take on 20,000 containers at a time. The industry is struggling like never before, and is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, most communication is conducted through phone and even fax, paper is still used in abundance, there can be over 15 process handovers moving a container, and there are large regional differences in performance among players.<p>We want to change that, and bring the industry into the digital age. Portchain (www.port-chain.com) is a Danish startup founded by 3 McKinsey alums in February 2017 that aims to significantly reduce operational cost and complexity for all players while providing industry leading customer experience. From our office in Bredgade next to Amalienborg, we are ramping up our team from five people to ten over the next four months. As such we are hiring only the highest caliber developers to join our team, and help reshape shipping.","time":1491235653,"type":"comment"}
