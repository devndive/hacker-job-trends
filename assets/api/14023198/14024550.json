We&#x27;ve gone from &lt;1MM to $XXMM in revenue flowing through our marketplace. Our stack is java&#x2F;spring&#x2F;thrift&#x2F;rabbitmq&#x2F;elasticsearch&#x2F;mongodb&#x2F;mysql node&#x2F;backbone with plans to move to react as soon as we get headcount. Looking for either&#x2F;both a java architect with some devops experience and&#x2F;or a full-stack engineer not afraid of java or any javascript framework. If you&#x27;re interested at all would love to talk to you dkim@rubiconproject.com.","time":1491238568,"type":"comment"}
