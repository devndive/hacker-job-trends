Our goal is to develop brain-machine interfaces so useful and so safe that ordinary people will choose to get them like they get a smartphone. Neuralink&#x27;s aim is to bring humans and machines closer so software forms a true extension of ourselves, rather than something separate we interact with slowly and awkwardly.<p>We are primarily looking for really strong MEMS, microfab, and mechatronics engineers, and materials scientists but are hiring for a fairly diverse set of technical backgrounds. There is a ton of software to write ranging from firmware to robotics controllers to web app experiment control and database management.<p>jobs@neuralink.com","time":1491259211,"type":"comment"}
