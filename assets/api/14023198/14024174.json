Millions of farmers globally don&#x27;t have access to the basic farm tools the rest of the world depends on for food production, good seed and fertilizer. We sell these proven agricultural tools on credit, and use satellite data and ML to figure out who we can lend to profitably.<p>We use Scala, Python&#x2F;NumPy&#x2F;SciPy (for science&#x2F;ML), android and are heavy postgres users. We&#x27;re building great software for places with low reliability networks and harsh environmental conditions.<p>We just finished delivering fertilizer and seed to 1000 farmers in our first year, and want you to help us get to our first million farmers.<p>We&#x27;re hiring for Software Engineers and Data Scientists, email me (the CTO) at earl@apolloagriculture.com. I answer every email personally and would love to be introduced to any smart people you think would be interested.","time":1491236768,"type":"comment"}
