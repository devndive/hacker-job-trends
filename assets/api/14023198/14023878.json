We run a niche hosting operation directed at the Wikimedia community tooling and ecosystem.  We are migrating some of our workload to Kubernetes slowly (from an aging Grid Engine setup), and maintain our own OpenStack cloud.  We use a lot of Python, Puppet, and debug wherever problems take us.<p>We do a round of interviews starting with HR, hiring manager, and team members.
