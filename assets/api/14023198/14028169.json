Instead engineers are empowered to develop and ship features in their entirety covering the whole stack. This feature of product development is enabled by Hustle&#x27;s particular technology choices: the use of JavaScript, React, React Native and Node.js through out the stack. It&#x27;s a stack that heavily rewards generalists that just want to ship things. It also makes for a very dynamic working environment: form a temporary team for a larger project where you decide to focus on shipping a polished mobile frontend and for the next project form another temporary team where you would focus on delivering a humming backend.<p>Hustle was started by engineers from Facebook and MongoDB and is backed by top VC firms including Social Capital and Index Ventures.
