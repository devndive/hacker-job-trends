Major semiconductor companies world wide are using our software to validate chip design libraries and IP blocks.<p>For the expansion of our international software development team based in the Netherlands we are searching for a software engineer who can work independently, is passionate about his work, and eager to learn. Our main development languages are C++11 and Python. We are now migrating to C++14, and once GCC stabilizes C++17 we will upgrade to that.
