Using a combination of 3D art and computer vision, we allow you to &quot;try on&quot; furniture in your own home before you buy it. Our product is brought to life by a diverse and talented team of engineers, artists, designers and creators.<p>We&#x27;re first movers in a fast-growing space that will become the future of home design. Check out modsy.com&#x2F;portfolio and see if you can tell which of our images on our site are real vs. renderings (hint: they are all renderings). Our stack is React&#x2F;Redux&#x2F;WebGL + Django&#x2F;Python.<p>We do a phone&#x2F;in-person interview with the Head of Engineering (me), phone call with one of our engineers, and then one day in office to meet the team.<p>Drop us a line at jobs@modsy.com if you&#x27;re interested to learn more! We&#x27;d also love to talk to anyone who leans more toward pure front or back end engineer.","time":1491236049,"type":"comment"}
