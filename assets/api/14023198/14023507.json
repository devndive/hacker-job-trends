Years of step by step technology evolution in data centers have resulted in inefficient software stacks. Data consumption is very different than it was twenty years ago, yet many enterprises still try to meet new requirements by using old concepts and paradigms. While innovation in the space of analytics and machine learning applications has been phenomenal, the underlying data platforms have stayed behind, prohibiting enterprises from truly adopting these advances in efficient ways. We, the iguazio team have decided to change this. We’ve built our data platform from the ground up, unleashing the full potential of applications and analytics for big data, IoT and cloud-native applications. We have developed a new service-driven approach to enterprise data management, redesigning the entire data stack to accelerate performance and bridge the enterprise skill gap.<p>Open Positions - See  <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;iguaz.io&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;iguaz.io&#x2F;careers</a>  for the full descriptions.<p>Solution Architect (West Coast, Singapore)<p>Big Data Engineer<p>Senior Automation Engineer<p>Python Developer<p>Research Software Engineer – Student Position<p>Send your resume to careers@iguaz.io and mention Hacker News!","time":1491233474,"type":"comment"}
