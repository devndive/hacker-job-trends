Our system matches users with hundreds of possible opportunities in real-time. Needless to say, we&#x27;re looking for people who care about performance. A lot. Our back-end systems are written in C#, Redis, Mongo, and SQLServer. You might know C# or Java or you might not, but either way you&#x27;re willing to learn. Regardless, you can impress us in your language of choice. If you&#x27;re a Senior Engineer - you&#x27;ve worked in server-side code for a few years. You&#x27;ve scaled to thousands or maybe millions of users. If you&#x27;re a Junior engineer, you love to code and you&#x27;re good at it. You&#x27;re smart, you&#x27;re passionate, and most of all you can&#x27;t wait to get started. (New grads please apply!)<p>Front-end Engineers:\nYou know Javascript. You know the ins, the outs and how to make it blazing fast. You care about performance because you know your users are waiting for every line of your code. You&#x27;ve used some popular frameworks, maybe angular or react - but you know one or more cold.<p>Dev-ops Engineers:\nWhen you were a kid, you probably took apart every clock in your house. You might have even put some of them back together. You spot system issues by watching graphs with only peripheral vision.\nWe use Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, Mongo, and a lot of other cutting edge technologies. You have experience in all or some of those but either way you love getting clusters of systems humming. If you&#x27;re a systems tinkerer, please apply.<p>Where we are:<p>Charlotte, NC: If you&#x27;re into great weather and a central location (our airport is an American hub) you should check us out. You can pick great urban living (Uptown&#x27;s 4th ward is the place to be) or get yourself a huge house (at reasonable prices) in the burbs. The standard of living for an engineer doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.","time":1491233038,"type":"comment"}
