We are a fifth the cost of comparable products because we&#x27;ve offloaded much of the functionality to cloud software. Push a button, out come flat-pack wallets, lamps, board games, and anything else you can dream up. We&#x27;re building a catalog of designs that can be customized  and a materials store.  We&#x27;ve got beta units in the field and users are loving them (and making amazing things).<p>Other Highlights:<p>* Largest 30-day crowdfunding campaign in history ($27.9M).  Weâ€™ve since pre-sold a total of $50M or so.\n* Recently closed a $22M Series B from Brad Feld&#x2F;Foundry and True Ventures, and have ~56 employees. \n* The three founders have manufactured hardware, sold companies, gone through YC, and built profitable businesses.","time":1491242551,"type":"comment"}
