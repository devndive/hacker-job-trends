We&#x27;ve grown a lot since then, but we still have a tight-knit, incredibly high-leverage group of engineers. Even after two years, I still love going to the office each morning. I get to work with the smartest folks I&#x27;ve ever met, on software that is going to modernize an industry that&#x27;s fundamental to the modern world. No team I&#x27;ve ever been on, including at Amazon, has felt like I could have this kind of impact.<p>We would love more engineers, up and down the stack, and anywhere on the generalist &lt;-&gt; specialist spectrum. We use pretty cutting-edge tech (React, React-Native for mobile, TypeScript + Node for backend), but we&#x27;re a lot more interested in engineering chops than any particular tech skills.<p>If you&#x27;re in Seattle, in tech, and interested in the business, reach out and grab coffee with me or one of our other developers. Help us grow an amazing tech team from a very early point in our company&#x27;s history!<p>Some, but not necessarily all, of our open jobs: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.convoy.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.convoy.com</a>","time":1491249442,"type":"comment"}
