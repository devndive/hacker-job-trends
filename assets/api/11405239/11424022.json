Originally started 15 years ago to serve stroke patients, our program uses video-conferencing, the website my team builds, and other technologies to treat patients remotely. The culture is like a startup inside the nation&#x27;s top hospital.<p>We use .NET MVC 5 with C#. SQL and JS are obviously important as well. Specific experience with .NET is not required, so if you are interested and have web-development or OOP experience, give us a shout.<p>Please feel free to contact me, Patrick Dillon, at pddillon@partners.org.","time":1459793718,"type":"comment"}
