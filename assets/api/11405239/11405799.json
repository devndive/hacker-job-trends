Every day one new research project gets funded, and we have a community of ~50,000 scientists and explorers.<p>We&#x27;re a small team that&#x27;s fiercely mission-driven and user focused. We frequently meets with our users to go on dinosaur digs, redwood tree-climbing survey expeditions, ocean dives, and bird banding trips with our users, because our users are scientists.<p>Internally, our team has this term we call &quot;jelly&quot;, it&#x27;s the special feeling you get when you&#x27;re interacting with and helping our scientists, and everything kind of comes together into this cosmic bliss. I imagine it&#x27;s what astronauts feel when they look at Earth from the space station.<p>Our stack is a mix of rails, react, backbone, postgres, redis, D3, and more. Our engineering approach is focused on automation and scale - building platform tools for the community to support themselves.<p>The code you write will directly affect a community of scientists making real discoveries, like this article from The Economist yesterday (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;science-and-technology&#x2F;21695858-bizarre-bird-will-have-all-its-surviving-members-genomes-sequenced-not\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;science-and-technology&#x2F;2169585...</a>). We&#x27;re making history by helping scientists to sequence the genomes of every single individual of this endangered bird species (there&#x27;s only ~140 of them).<p>We&#x27;re looking for people who care a lot about science!<p>Check out <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;experiment.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;experiment.com&#x2F;jobs</a> for more info, or send us a shout at jobs@experiment.com.","time":1459526480,"type":"comment"}
