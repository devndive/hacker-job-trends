In the process we&#x27;re helping them to feel happier and more confident about themselves. We&#x27;re backed by a collection of the top investors from London and Silicon Valley as well as Y Combinator.<p>You&#x27;d be joining a small, highly technical team with lots of startup experience (the founders have started and sold 2 companies before). We&#x27;re lucky to have had a lot of success bringing together exceptional people in design, machine learning&#x2F;AI and engineering, and we&#x27;re now focussed on finding our first dedicated data engineer. You&#x27;ll be working closely with Ed Snelson, Thread&#x27;s Head of Applied Research and a world leader in data science, to build systems to improve our recommendations. Using data to help our users dress well is at the core of what we do; it&#x27;s not a nice-to-have bolted onto the product. You&#x27;ll be responsible for building predictive model training pipelines, assisting with model feature development, data warehousing, and working with the styling and product teams to ensure our clients receive the best experience possible.<p>Want to learn more?
