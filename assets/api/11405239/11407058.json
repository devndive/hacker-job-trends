After releasing Mother &amp; the motion cookies, we’re now working on the Peanuts, a family of easy-to-use BLE sensors.\nWe’re looking for:\n- A full-stack developer to help build the next generation of applications for the Peanuts. Our stack is mostly python-based, with heavy use of Django, Rabbitmq, Mysql, Mongodb and Angularjs on the front-end.\n- An iOS developer, who would be working on the upcoming Peanut app. We’re especially looking for people with experience connecting BLE devices and working with REST APIs. An experience building an SDK is a big bonus.\nWe’re a relatively small team (12 people, of which 6 engineers),  working on all parts of the product, so you’d have the opportunity to take part and learn about multiple aspects of the process. If this sounds like something you’d like, please shoot us an email at jobs@sen.se, or see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sen.se&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sen.se&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs</a> for more info.","time":1459533945,"type":"comment"}
