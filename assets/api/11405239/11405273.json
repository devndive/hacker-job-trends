We’ve raised over $20m in funding and have centrally located offices in London (eng + product) and New York (commerical). Most importantly, we’re solving a problem that makes a real difference to the lives of millions of patients worldwide.<p>We’ve developed a question-based algorithm for probabilistically matching patients to trials (take it for a spin with our initial US diabetes release: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;trialreach.com&#x2F;diabetes.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;trialreach.com&#x2F;diabetes.html</a>) and we’re recruiting engineers for our London office. Our back-end is predominantly Python.<p>We&#x27;re also interested in talking to anyone with experience of data architecture for healthcare products. In particular this would mean a good understanding of available medical ontologies and a solid theoretical understandig of database architectures.<p>For more details on this (+ other roles inc product and project management) please see here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;trialreach.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;trialreach.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs.html</a><p>If you have any questions feel free to email jobs at trialreach.com (please mention that you saw this on HN and these will come through to me).
