At Panorama Education, we’re bringing that culture of measurement to education. Schools use our platform to collect feedback from students, families and teachers, and then use our education-specific analytics tools to make sense of that data and act on it to drive improvement.<p>In the three years since YC we’ve grown to serve over 2.5 million students in 6,500 schools across the world, including many of the biggest districts in the country. We’re a fast-growing team of 50 (10 engineers) based in Boston, and we’re looking for engineers to join us.<p>We value engineers who appreciate hard technical problems — from building a highly available survey platform to scaling analytics pipelines — but who also care about the end goal of improving the lives of educators and students around the world. We’re a small, tight-knit team, so we’re looking for engineers who thrive on autonomy and want to participate in building a first-class engineering culture focused on collaboration, technical excellence and diversity.<p>If this sounds interesting to you, shoot me an email at jlarsen@panoramaed.com.","time":1459545675,"type":"comment"}
