We use advanced chemistry to barcode the fragmented DNA that flow through sequencers, and then software pipelines to group them together again.  This regrouping process can resolve biologically relevant questions about large structural genetic mutations, inheritance, and variation of gene expression between cells.  The market for our platform is growing rapidly, and our instruments and software are used at some of the top research institutions and hospitals in the world.<p>We are particularly looking for systems engineers who have experience developing cloud architecture, and UI engineers who have developed dynamic web applications.  You will be developing software that will enable researchers to get from basecalls to answers much faster.  You can view a demo of our existing software at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;loupe.10xgenomics.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;loupe.10xgenomics.com</a>.<p>We manage our pipelines with Go, develop analysis code using the NumPy stack, and drive our front-end applications with AngularJS.  Our software team is small; four people are working exclusively on system architecture and visualization, with about a dozen computational biologists developing the analyses.  No previous biological experience is required; we have plenty of folks here to handle that.<p>10x has a remarkable team of experts from across many domains, a fresh new round of funding led by Fidelity and SoftBank, and the technology to make a great impact on genetic research.  If you have an interest in something different, something futuristic, and something altruistic, feel free to reach out at jeff@10xgenomics.com.","time":1459536116,"type":"comment"}
