Our proprietary nanopore-based platform allows for single molecule, electrical, real-time analysis without the need for complicated optics or fluidics. In other words, Genia’s sequencing platform is cheaper, faster, and better than any of the alternatives, and thus has the potential to revolutionize medical care by bringing genetic analysis to the clinic. With our platform, we can truly reach the $10 genome, and begin to make practical the promises of personalized medicine.<p>We are hiring for Python software engineers. We have tons of data coming off our sequencer, and we need people with experience handling complex algorithms over large data sets to help us analyze it all.<p>Full details here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;genia-technologies\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;genia-technologies</a> but the long and short of it is-- if you want to work in a fast-paced research environment full of people passionate about changing the speed at which science and medicine operate, email me: karmel.allison [at sign] roche.com","time":1459524715,"type":"comment"}
