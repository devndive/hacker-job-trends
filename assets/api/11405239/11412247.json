Tech stack includes Objective- C and Java (Android) for mobile, Javascript for the web app and Go as our primary server side language.<p>Spring&#x27;s big idea is to create one single platform that gives consumers access to 1,000s of brands. Consumers win because they have 24&#x2F;7 access to a curated selection of brands from around the world, often at cheaper prices than they would see in stores. Brands win because they can directly reach a large customer base without restrictions like physical location or reseller costs.<p>We&#x27;re three years old and have grown to 85 employees. Our NYC Headquarters is based in Flatiron and we have a small team in Krakow. We have over 1,000 brands currently on the platform and more than 600k active users. Big plans for the years include increasing both of these numbers, building additional features into both the mobile and web apps, and scaling our existing system.<p>Visit www.shopspring.com&#x2F;engineering to learn more about Spring&#x27;s dev team.
