We&#x27;re aimed at graphic designers — who often are still focused on print media and have almost no online design experience — and enable them to create responsive online interactive magazines. Our platform makes something that for them used to be almost impossible, magically easy — and the enthusiasm we receive from our users is extremely rewarding.<p>Technically: the H5mag editor is basically a big Javascript web app. Our backend is a relatively simple data store&#x2F;rendering layer written in PHP&#x2F;MySQL.<p>Some concrete things we want you to work on in the coming period...<p>* Improve the performance of our editor and reader front-end, eliminate relayouts and repaints\n* Make our users happy with new, often requested features, such as guides &amp; grids and undo&#x2F;redo\n* Develop improvements for our editor, such as a new edition management UX and new styling widgets\n* Work with us on a system for real-time collaborative editing\n* Want to know what moves our users? Participate in our designer workshops and discover their needs.<p>We&#x27;re still a small team of developers and UX designers, so you have quite the opportunity to make your mark. Want to know more?
