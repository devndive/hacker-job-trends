Our system provides address-only underwriting and a one-click bindable quote: the possible applications are nearly unlimited.<p>We&#x27;re writing policies in limited markets now, and getting great traction: we primarily need help expanding our systems to handle the rest of the US. Each of the cofounders has at least one successful startup under their belt, and collectively decades of high-level experience in the insurance industry.<p>We&#x27;re using the MS stack - C#, TypeScript, Azure - and could use some strong full-stack developers. You&#x27;d be getting in on the ground floor, with lots of opportunity to shape architecture and technical direction.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, email me at ken [at] (swyfft.com).","time":1459530223,"type":"comment"}
