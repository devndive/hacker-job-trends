Our product is backed by cutting-edge machine learning technology that can tell which appliances are on in your house and how much power they&#x27;re using, in real time, by sampling the electrical signal.<p>We&#x27;re looking for data scientists to work on our core load disaggregation technology. You&#x27;ll dive into messy time-series data to develop new unsupervised algorithms for detecting home appliances, drive those algorithms to production, and verify how well they perform in the wild. Signal processing, Python, and C++ are all useful skills to have, though not required.<p>We&#x27;re currently a team of fourteen, we started shipping product in December, and we&#x27;re now scaling up. Come join us!<p>Email me at ryan@sense.com.","time":1459528422,"type":"comment"}
