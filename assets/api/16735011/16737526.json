The BlackBerry Cloud Platform team is looking for people with a love of building infrastructure through ‘code’ with the mission to develop a highly performant, fault-tolerant, scalable, distributed system in the ‘Cloud’.  Why release monthly or quarterly when you could be releasing hourly?  We need to deliver content continuously with reliability, and resiliency, from development to production in minutes.<p>The BlackBerry IoT Platform makes it easy for our customers and internal verticals to build connected solutions for embedded products such as remote management, asset tracking, device software updates, and big data analytics.<p>If your browser history contains cloud service provider links , &#x2F;r&#x2F;devops, container technologies, continuous deployment blogs, automated scaling, and fault detection, then this is very likely the job for you.<p>While we are happy to provide DevOps professionals who want to specialize in that role exclusively the opportunity to do so, we also recognize that DevOps works best as a first class citizen in the product development process.  For that reason, we encourage interested DevOps personnel to also spend time contributing to the services they look after – that is, working side by side with the development teams, implementing features and fixing bugs to advance the products in the marketplace.  In that capacity, your passion for the products we develop will have the opportunity to shine.<p>More information see the posting: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2Jct7Ml\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2Jct7Ml</a>\nOr email me directly at cstubbs@blackberry.com","time":1522693398,"type":"comment"}
