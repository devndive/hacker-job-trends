A specialized database. Kentik is a tool to ingest and process network metadata: how many bytes, how many packets, are your tcp sessions suddenly seeing an uptick in re-transmits, how does your window size look, are you under attack, did you just get BGP high-jacked?<p>We wrote a custom database in go, which at its heart works by taking a time range, storing all events by time-slice and then at query time querying each time segment in parallel. This is hidden behind a Postgres front end using the foreign data wrapper interface PG provides. A data visualization layer on top distills the inputs down into actionable intelligence.<p>The end result of all this is that when anything changes on your network you get a slack message.<p>Interested? We&#x27;re hiring for multiple roles, including:<p>* Full stack JS engineer working in a react code base. Work up from postgres -&gt; node -&gt; client browser.<p>* System engineer fluent in go and&#x2F;or rust. Build fault tolerant distributed applications capable of handling billions of data points per day.<p>* Product manager.
