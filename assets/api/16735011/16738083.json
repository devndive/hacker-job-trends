Our MVP is moments away from launching and customers are queuing to take it for a spin. As such, we&#x27;re growing our team to tackle the challenges ahead.<p>We&#x27;re a team of 8, located at London&#x27;s South Bank and value continuous learning, empathy with our clients and customers, and empowering our engineers to make the best decisions.<p># Front-End Engineer<p>This is for someone who:<p>- is comfortable in functional programming, especially Elm; and<p>- is experienced shipping front-end software to production; and<p>- has empathy for users and loves friendly UX; and<p>- has an eagerness to learn and willingness to share knowledge.<p>## A Typical Day<p>- Start off writing a feature that requires elm-ports. These can be tricky, so you pair with another developer who has shipped such code before.<p>- After lunch you&#x27;re requested to review a Pull Request that fixes a bug you accidentally introduced a couple weeks back. There&#x27;s no blame, instead some discussion about how our tests and review process could have caught this earlier.<p>- The afternoon is spent with the Product guys around a whiteboard. You&#x27;re helping them sketch out a realistic wire-frame for a feature we plan to deliver in a couple of weeks.<p># Dev-Ops Engineer<p>We&#x27;re believers in CI and automated testing, but we need some help getting there. In particular we spend far too much time:<p>- Ensuring our testing, deployment, and validation services are up to date with the product.<p>- Managing different servers for staging and production.<p>- Trying to ensure we have a consistent build process across different machines.<p>- Thinking about the best way to deliver our machine-learning services in production.<p>You should have:<p>- experience maintaining CI services;<p>- experience writing web applications in a functional language;<p>- experience with different build processes (e.g. Make, `webpack`);<p>- knowledge of and comfortability with Linux, AWS, and Docker.<p># Some Tech we like:<p>We&#x27;re more interested in a willingness and ability to learn than what you currently know. But in case your interested in the stack we&#x27;re using:<p>- Haskell<p>- Elm<p>- PostgreSQL<p>- Python &#x2F; scikit-learn<p>- Tensorflow &#x2F; Deep learning<p>- AWS<p>- CircleCI<p>- Automated Testing<p>contact info in my profile.","time":1522696111,"type":"comment"}
