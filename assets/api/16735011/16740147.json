Take notes in Dooly, we update Salesforce for you, and we surface information in the moment to help close deals.\nCheck out our website: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dooly.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dooly.ai</a><p>CRM is broken. You pay a lot of money for the software, then you hire an administrator, and then no one puts the data in because it&#x27;s not helping them do what they were hired for: to sell. We&#x27;re on a mission to fix that.<p>We&#x27;ve spent the last year building a foundation and obsessing on early customers.. we&#x27;re now seeing the fruits of that. Our customers tell us that they love and couldn&#x27;t live without Dooly, including some well-known valley brands that we&#x27;re excited to have using. New deals are coming in on an almost weekly basis. Now we&#x27;re ramping up to deliver knowledge in the moment and help our customers be the smartest people in their meetings.<p>We&#x27;re a small, super-passionate team and we&#x27;re looking to bring onboard another well-rounded engineer. Our stack is es6&#x2F;react&#x2F;redux on the frontend and rails on the backend.<p>Everyone here is passionate about design and bringing consumer-grade product to the enterprise.<p>Send me an email if you&#x27;re in Vancouver or if anything caught your attention!<p>-&gt; justin@dooly.ai","time":1522708981,"type":"comment"}
