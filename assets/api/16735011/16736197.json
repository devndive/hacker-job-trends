We&#x27;re a small team looking for Software Engineers at any level of experience to help us move our key software in-house. This isn&#x27;t your typical retail&#x2F;e-commerce gig -- we&#x27;re committed to investing heavily in our technology and making it a real differentiator for our business.<p>As for our stack, we&#x27;re using Vue.js on the frontend, and microservices (mostly Python) on the backend, which we deploy via Docker to our Nomad&#x2F;Consul cluster. You don&#x27;t need to have experience with these technologies though. We&#x27;re just looking for great engineers regardless of their background.<p>We prefer onsite developers in either Columbus, Ohio or New York, NY, but for the right candidate (senior level or with prior remote experience) we are also open to remote work.<p>You can get in touch with me directly at jsmith [at] eloquii [dot] com. Just mention HN, and I&#x27;ll try to get you fast-tracked through our hiring process.","time":1522687232,"type":"comment"}
