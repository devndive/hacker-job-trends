We are in a growing, opportunity-rich enterprise market: $13B are spent every year on professional services for Salesforce development.<p>We believe that maintaining high-revenue-per-employee is the best way to ensure that company culture stays strong. We admire companies like Basecamp, Mailchimp and Atlassian. We are funded by customer revenue and Indie.vc.<p>Our stack is primarily Python and Go (Node.js developers interested in learning Go should also apply). Youâ€™ll get to work directly with the CTO on important technology decisions.<p>Email team@bluecanvas.io if you&#x27;re interested. No recruiters please.","time":1522714270,"type":"comment"}
