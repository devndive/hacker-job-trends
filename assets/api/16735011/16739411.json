Learners and their parents love it, and sales are great.<p>We are an accomplished team of five in SF, with experience in education, marketplaces, software, and operating online services at Udemy, Amazon, Airbnb, YC, Square, Google, and many startups. We&#x27;re ambitious and pragmatic. We prioritize carefully, run experiments, start simple, then iterate. This gives us confidence that we’re learning about our customers and building what they want. It also means we have less risk, randomness, and drama than most early startups.<p>We&#x27;re now looking for a senior software engineer to complement our team. You would get involved early in building a new kind of educational system, and contribute a lot to our success. Everything about our product will evolve, so you&#x27;ll work on a variety of projects: in-class interactions, teacher success, communication tools, marketplace discovery, metrics, internal process, infrastructure, and more. Our stack is modern JavaScript: React, Apollo&#x2F;GraphQL, Node&#x2F;Express, and Postgres.<p>We think the best candidates care about learning and education. You’ll need a mature perspective on engineering tradeoffs, product decisions, and teamwork. You must have been programming professionally and challenging yourself for at least 5 years. You have something to teach us.<p>Reach out to work@outschool.com","time":1522703858,"type":"comment"}
