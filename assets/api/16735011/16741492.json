Its critically acclaimed sleep surface was developed in-house, has a sleek design, and is delivered in a small, &quot;how did they do that?&quot;-sized box. The company is one of the fastest-growing consumer brands of all time, and its product line has expanded to include sheets, pillows, a matching foundation, and a dog mattress. Casper was named one of Fast Company&#x27;s 50 Most Innovative Companies in 2017, and its eponymous mattress was crowned one of TIME Magazine&#x27;s Best Inventions.<p>We are deeply committed to building a diverse and inclusive workforce so that we represent all those who dream big equally.","time":1522723558,"type":"comment"}
