There is no separate devops team because we are the devops team. It&#x27;s been a fun ride so far, many hiccups along the way (I&#x27;ll be transparent about what we are good and not so good at), and we&#x27;re excited to be on the lookout for more people to join.<p>Looking for people who have been programming professionally for 3+ years<p>Email me at amian (at) morningconsult (dottt) com if you are interested in any of these roles!<p>Edited for brevity","time":1522717979,"type":"comment"}
