The app and its services are exposed both internally and externally via a GraphQL API.  We primarily rely on MySQL for persistent storage, Redis for temporary storage, and, as you might expect, a lot of git repositories.  We rely on Kubernetes for container orchestration.","time":1522693412,"type":"comment"}
