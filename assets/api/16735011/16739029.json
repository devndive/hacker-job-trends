We&#x27;re a small team building the analytics engine that powers 6,000 companies and helps them make smarter decisions.<p>Heap automates away the pain of data.

Instead, Heap automatically captures everything: clicks, submissions, taps, etc. This lets our users analyze data instantly and retroactively, without writing code.<p>We’d particularly like to get to know you if:<p>- you communicate with clarity and precision. We care about this almost as much as your technical ability.<p>- you&#x27;re passionate, even if it&#x27;s not about analytics. There should be something you know more about than anyone on our team.<p>- you’ve written 10,000 lines of code that look embarrassing in retrospect. ... and you&#x27;ve written 10,000 lines of good code since then.<p>Our app-layer stack is TypeScript, React, Node.js, Redis, and PostgreSQL.<p>Under the hood, Heap is powered by CoffeeScript, Scala, ZooKeeper, Kafka, and CitusDB.<p>If you are interested, please email at anojh@heapanalytics.com or visit <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;heapanalytics.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;heapanalytics.com&#x2F;jobs</a>","time":1522701386,"type":"comment"}
