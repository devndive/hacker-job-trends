We partner with pharmacies that send patients customized pre-sorted medication trays that insert into our custom-designed smart pillbox. Our pillbox can sense when medication is removed and send patients and&#x2F;or their caregivers automated reminders.

Our patients love us because we take away the complexity of managing medications and our customers love us because we keep patients healthy and out of the hospital--only 33% of patients take their medication as prescribed and 125,000 people die each year because of medication related errors.
