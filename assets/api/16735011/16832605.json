We don&#x27;t take on projects unless they are disruptive or audacious. Check out our case studies and blog to get a bit of the idea. Those pages are only the tip of the iceberg, primarily because of NDAs. Then check out the careers page for a more complete job description. We want generalists and&#x2F;or people who are exploring their career choices. If you want to specialize in RF antenna design, this is not the place for you. If you want to see how the sausage is made in a wide variety of industries, we are right up your alley.<p>Case studies (past work): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motivo.com&#x2F;case-studies\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motivo.com&#x2F;case-studies</a>\nBlog: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motivo.com&#x2F;blog\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motivo.com&#x2F;blog</a>\nCareers: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motivo.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motivo.com&#x2F;careers</a><p>Email me to chat: samarin at motivoengineering dawt com","time":1523643910,"type":"comment"}
