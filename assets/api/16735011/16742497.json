This anachronism renders the data all but ineffective for sharing and business intelligence. The BULLET platform presents a solution that empowers entrepreneurs* everywhere. Our service digitizes their correspondence and uncovers valuable information hidden in their mailboxes for them. The entire process runs seamlessly as a straightforward experience: Scanned postal mail is forwarded directly to the dedicated BULLET email inbox. Our customers always remain in control, as we apply the highest standards in compliance and privacy when archiving and shredding documents. BULLET does more than offering support for a company in its understanding of regulatory requirements on safeguarding documents properly. Now, businesses can leverage formerly inaccessible data for more insight and profit. It finally becomes digitally available across the entire supply chain and operations – securely and quickly.<p>BULLET is looking for full-time employees who want to join an early stage startup with all the benefits and challenges it entails – including the heavy lifting and upending of existing structures. We have set aside generous equity packages to distribute amongst our early team members on-site in Berlin.<p>The development of the MVP has kicked off with Go, Elm, MySQL and Docker. Possible future technologies range from Kubernetes, minio, Kafka, NATS to others. We are currently assembling the core tech team, which will shape our strategy for the years to come.<p>Contact: seong-min.kang@bulletglobal.com","time":1522739610,"type":"comment"}
