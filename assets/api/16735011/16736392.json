We are an API for background checks- it may sound boring at first but there are interesting problems to solve and we&#x27;ve seen lots of success in the market. We are hiring for all sorts of engineering roles, and are working on expanding the product beyond APIs to target traditional enterprises and innovate in a space that sorely needs innovation.<p>A little about our stack: Ruby&#x2F;Sinatra&#x2F;Rails, MySQL and Mongo, RabbitMQ and Kafka for queueing, React and Angular frontends, growing Golang and Python microservices, Kubernetes and Docker for deploying, Presto for our data warehouse, moving to gRPC for service communication.<p>Come help us redefine background checks!<p>If any (or all) of that sounds like fun drop me an email if you want to learn more: ben+hn@checkr.com","time":1522688195,"type":"comment"}
