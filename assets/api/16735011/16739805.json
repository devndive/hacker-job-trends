We design, build, own, and operate an automated cell and molecular biology infrastructure that scientists from all over the world use remotely over the internet. We are &quot;cloud computing&quot; for experimental biology: we enable &quot;labless&quot; biotech companies in the same way that software companies no longer build their own infrastructure. In addition to our cloud lab offering, Transcriptic is also implementing our technology at partner sites, such as Ginkgo Bioworks in Boston (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;JosL4H\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;JosL4H</a>).<p>As an engineer on the TCLE (Transcriptic Common Lab Environment) team, you will get to work on the tech stack that is responsible for scheduling and execution of runs on our multi-tenant biology infrastructure (workcells). The stack is primarily built in Scala, and uses RabbitMQ as the communication backbone.<p>Please apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.transcriptic.com&#x2F;hiring&#x2F;?gh_jid=1092746\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.transcriptic.com&#x2F;hiring&#x2F;?gh_jid=1092746</a>","time":1522706491,"type":"comment"}
