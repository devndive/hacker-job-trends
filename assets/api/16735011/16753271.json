We’re data driven with software at our core. Our world-class engineers write immaculate code to support the world’s fastest growing supermarket. We’re on a quest for likeminded people to be part of the future of in-app grocery shopping. Picnic is growing fast. We&#x27;re a tech-first venture, where you ship code that either gets used by thousands of customers (and growing fast!) or runs our supply chain and is used by our hundreds of warehouse employees, where efficiency is key. Few places offer the chance to impact so much with the code you make.\nExtra fun parts: we&#x27;re a grocery story at the core, with total ownership of the supply chain. We also have warehouses which operate on the code you write, so you can go see how it affects the whole company right on the work floor.\nWe&#x27;re hiring for Java &amp; Mobile developers!
