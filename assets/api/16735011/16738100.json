We&#x27;re a small team previously at VW and Lyft backed by a leading VC in the AV space based in Toronto.<p>We&#x27;re building the passenger detection engineering team. Your job would be to write&#x2F;implement software that will ultimately detect rideshare passenger characteristics, carried objects and behaviors using sensors (base sensors are a camera and microphone). Ultimately, your software would detect a lost bag, weapon or even a heart attack.<p>If you have experience and passion in all or most of the following topics, we would love to talk to you:\n- Experience with machine learning\n- GPGPU (OpenCL&#x2F;Metal&#x2F;CUDA)\n- Python and&#x2F;or C&#x2F;C++\n- Sensor Fusion<p>Email me at martin@passenger.ai","time":1522696186,"type":"comment"}
