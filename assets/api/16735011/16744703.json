We are also constantly\ninvesting effort into developing our core printing algorithms further.<p>Tech stack: Dropwizard (Java 8, Kotlin), PostgreSQL, React, Redux, NGINX, Docker, Terraform<p>We are hiring for several roles<p>- Frontend (required: 1+ years experience with React, CSS &amp; HTML. Beneficial: experience with 3D programming e.g. ThreeJS, familiarity with REST APIs)<p>- Backend (required: 1+ years experience with a JVM server framework, REST, Strong grasp of computer science fundamentals. Beneficial: mathematical background&#x2F;strong knowledge of data structures&#x2F;algorithms)<p>- Data Science (required: 1+ years experience implementing modern machine learning techniques in a professional or academic capacity,\nfamiliarity with software engineering practices e.g. version control and application architecture. Beneficial: PhD in closely related area, prior experience working as a software engineer and&#x2F;or a computer science degree)<p>You will be joining at an early stage and thus will have a large say in how we progress our technology. We are hoping to find\nfellow engineers who care about code quality and modern software engineering best practices. We\naren&#x27;t into micro-managing and prefer people who have the ability to work independently with minimal guidance.<p>If you are interested, please contact us at jobs@ai-build.com","time":1522764525,"type":"comment"}
