They make saving energy “social, fun and simple.”<p>By engaging people on the platforms they already use, including email, Facebook, web, and mobile applications, and making energy usage data into a simple scoring system that allows people to compete with their friends and neighbors online, Simple Energy motivates people to become interested in their own energy use and take action to reduce consumption. The system is based on leading behavioral economics and game mechanics research by scientific advisor Dan Ariely, author of Predictably Irrational and The Upside of Irrationality. Results from a recent pilot program show that the platform can produce an average energy savings of 20% with up to 50% in savings for top performers.<p>See our open positions at <a href=\"http://utilities.simpleenergy.com/about-us/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;utilities.simpleenergy.com&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;jobs</a>","time":1383328265,"type":"comment"}
