Before ShowKit, it would take companies and software engineers months of intensive development to add features like audio&#x2F;video conferencing, screen sharing, and gesture control to their applications. Our first-to-market gesture control functionality empowers users to tap, swipe, highlight, and fully control another users&#x27; screen remotely while simultaneously connecting the two users via audio&#x2F;video conference.<p>Notably, ShowKit is the only framework that includes hardware accelerated video encoding &amp; decoding. This enables 720p at 30fps, the highest quality video conferencing resolution on the market, while using minimal cpu resources and allowing the app to run seamlessly in the background while a call is taking place. Comparable solutions use full cpu resources &amp; only achieve 4-5fps at that resolution, which isn&#x27;t feasible for video conferencing.<p><a href=\"https://angel.co/showkit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;showkit</a><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/ShowKitSDK\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;ShowKitSDK</a><p>Our Office &amp; Perks:<p>Our Penthouse office sits on the historic Sunset Strip with the best view of all of LA. <a href=\"http://imgur.com/5vFgKQQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;5vFgKQQ</a><p>- Top of the line gear<p>- Kitchen stocked full of drinks and snacks<p>- Friendly and down-to-earth work environment<p>- Health, Dental &amp; Vision Coverage","time":1383338414,"type":"comment"}
