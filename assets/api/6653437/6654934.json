We started this company so we could get very, very good at early stage product development - specifically using Customer Development and Lean Startup methodologies.<p>Our goal is two-fold: \n1) Consult with large and enterprise companies to help them learn and adapt these product development methodologies into their own organizations. We have done extensive work with Nordstrom and their Innovation Lab, and have recently been expanding our client base.<p>2) Use the consulting to bootstrap our own products, which we will spin out into separate companies. You laugh and say that&#x27;s what everyone tries to do, but we have already successfully done this once.<p><i></i>What we are looking for<i></i>\nWe&#x27;re looking for iOS developers with experience leading and teaching groups, who don&#x27;t believe in reinventing the circle (much less the wheel) every time you run into a problem, and who believe in a &quot;Discover the problem, then build the solution&quot; approach to building products.<p><i></i><i></i><p>Email: Zachary@liffft.com if you&#x27;re interested. Please include any links (resume, linkedin, github, portfolio, etc etc) you feel are relevant.","time":1383325611,"type":"comment"}
