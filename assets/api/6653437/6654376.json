It gives deep visibility in production apps running on Ruby, PHP, Python, Java, and .NET (with more platforms on the way).  Over 50,000 developer&#x2F;users have used our tools.<p>Making it easy for our users, however, is hard work.  Our answer is to hire top notch people and then turn them loose to solve tough problems as only they can.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a number of technical positions (check out the Jobs page), including engineers with skills in Ruby, Node, Python, C, PHP, .NET (to name a few). H1-Bs welcome.<p>We also take our company culture seriously -- Best Place to Work and all that, of course.  But we also provide an unusual and exciting development environment, one where managers are working to enable developers, not the other way around.<p>Come take a look.  <a href=\"http://newrelic.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;newrelic.com&#x2F;jobs</a>","time":1383319448,"type":"comment"}
