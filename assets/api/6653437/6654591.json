Anyone who joins us is going to have the best of both worlds, you&#x27;ll work on a product that millions love and use while getting the experience of being a part of a small team and helping define the culture.<p>WHO WE ARE<p>We&#x27;re a tiny, quick-shipping team. Each of us makes product decisions and owns whole features. We&#x27;re close and we all enjoy spending time together. We’re a small team because we’re picky about who joins us. We have one of the hardest technical interviews in NYC but if you make it, you’re going to be on the best team around. Our house library includes Metaprogramming in Ruby; Godel, Escher, Bach, an Eternal Golden Braid; POODR; and &quot;Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?&quot;. Loving rap is not a prerequisite for working here, though an appreciation osmoses to everyone after a while.<p>WHAT WE&#x27;RE BUILDING<p>We started Rap Genius in 2009 to explain the meaning of rap lyrics, but the big vision goes beyond music and touches all of text – whether it&#x27;s the Bill of Rights (<a href=\"http://news.rapgenius.com/United-states-congress-the-us-cons...\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.rapgenius.com&#x2F;United-states-congress-the-us-cons...</a>), the Bible (<a href=\"http://news.rapgenius.com/God-10-commandments-lyrics\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.rapgenius.com&#x2F;God-10-commandments-lyrics</a>), “The Waste Land” (<a href=\"http://poetry.rapgenius.com/Ts-eliot-the-waste-land-lyrics\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;poetry.rapgenius.com&#x2F;Ts-eliot-the-waste-land-lyrics</a>), or the Supreme Court’s DOMA ruling (<a href=\"http://news.rapgenius.com/The-supreme-court-of-the-united-st...\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.rapgenius.com&#x2F;The-supreme-court-of-the-united-st...</a>), it&#x27;s all on Rap Genius (or Poetry Genius, or News Genius, or... you get the idea). One of our favorite recent examples is Junot Diaz&#x27;s amazing annotations on an excerpt from his own The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao (<a href=\"http://poetry.rapgenius.com/Junot-diaz-the-brief-wondrous-li...\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;poetry.rapgenius.com&#x2F;Junot-diaz-the-brief-wondrous-li...</a>).<p>BENEFITS<p>* Bomb salary and equity—you won&#x27;t be taking a pay cut to work here<p>* We don&#x27;t count vacation days<p>* Free meals in the office, free unlimited Seamless, free unlimited Fresh Direct<p>* Free gym in the building<p>* We pay your phone bill and when you join we&#x27;ll upgrade you to the newest iPhone<p>* Laundry and shower in the office * Free indoor bike parking<p>* Free health, dental, and vision benefits<p>* The deluxe computer setup of your choice<p>WHAT WE&#x27;RE LOOKING FOR<p>* Experienced full-stack Rails engineers<p>* Front-end developers with an eye for design<p>* iOS devs to help build our upcoming iPhone app<p>INTERESTED?<p>Hit us up at jobs@rapgenius.com with:<p>* Your name and GitHub profile, your Twitter, blog, StackOverflow account, personal website, etc.<p>* A cool side project you built, library you&#x27;ve released, or some code that&#x27;s impressive<p>* Something brief about what you like and dislike about the technologies you&#x27;ve used<p>* Your résumé<p>* Apply if you live in NYC or are willing to relocate.
