Inck teaches them a new approach to thinking and communication that incorporates rhythm into the process. Through the same interface, Inck also provides mechanisms for them to engage in Generative Programming to build one of a menu of useful programs. Students choose what to build based on their own requirements for a software agent to help make their PCs more productive. The first prototype of Inck will be released on Jan 14th, 2014 to students at a local high tech institute.<p>Inck is written in C for the (old) Windows platform. Your work, to start with, will mostly involve programming. Over time, as you internalize the product idea, you will become more involved with product definition and the productization process (higher level stuff).<p>We pay you a market rate salary and upon successful completion of a six month probation process, we give you 1% equity in the company. We work a 36 hour, six hours a day, six day work week. Our work environment is intense and challenges you to grow. Allahabad is a laid back town with an academic tilt. This position provides you an opportunity to learn a lot of good engineering while at the same time share in the success of a new company. You will be working with a founder, CEO with over 20 years of experience in the industry and excellent academic and professional credentials.<p>To apply, go through our website, then send me an email at rohit@khitchdee.com. We&#x27;re very selective in our hiring and haven&#x27;t hired anyone yet.","time":1383356865,"type":"comment"}
