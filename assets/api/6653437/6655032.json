We love the feeling of getting an idea, exploring some hypotheses, and finding a surprising story in the data. And we love enabling others to have that feeling. So we’re creating the modern data analysis tool, so anyone can get as much value out of their data as a trained expert, and experts can get their insight much faster.<p>Most statistical analyses are conceptually simple, but existing software requires an unnecessarily large amount of statistical knowledge to ask simple questions. And even experts find these tools time-consuming and painful to use. So most people fall back to the much less powerful Excel (and its PivotTables), spending their time shuffling data around an interface that’s barely changed in 15 years. Statwing democratizes data analysis by making statistics easier to use and interpret than even Excel.<p>Our investors include Y Combinator, Jeff Hammerbacher (cofounded Cloudera, coined the term &quot;Data Science&quot;, built the Facebook data team) and Jason Seats (cofounded Slicehost, runs TechStars Cloud).<p>We&#x27;re hiring.
