As a result, we&#x27;re looking to expand our engineering team. We are looking for full-stack engineers and senior engineers, especially focused on our backend analytics technology.<p>Experience with high write performance DBs (e.g. Redis, Cassandra), large-scale log analysis (e.g. Hadoop, Pig, Hive), and big distributed cloud systems (e.g. &gt;20 node cloud deployments) will mean you&#x27;ll hit the ground running here.<p>You&#x27;d be joining the company at a great time. Our engineering team is still small enough that we feel like an elite task force, but unlike two years ago, we are making millions in revenue and have a ridiculous amount of data to draw insight out of on behalf of our customers.<p>You should be an expert in a mainstream programming language, preferably Python or JavaScript. You should be willing to learn, or already know, technologies like Tornado, MongoDB, Redis, Solr, Postgres, Cassandra, Pig, Storm, and Amazon Web Services. You should be extremely handy at a UNIX command line, possessing all the skills of a sysadmin.<p>Also, if you happen to be an experienced software engineer who wants to end up in a role with a mixture of product management, customer interaction, and individual contributions to the code, we have just the position for you. Let us know -- we&#x27;re looking for you. But we&#x27;re also looking for DevOps candidates to help us manage our systems and great backend engineers to help us build a powerful and robust analytics system for our customers and the high-performance APIs they depend upon.<p>If you join us, you&#x27;ll be part of a well-funded and high-revenue SaaS analytics company that is rewriting the rules of online media. Our software aggregates data on over 5 billion pageviews per month of traffic, and we work with major media companies as customers, such as The Atlantic, Arstechnica, Mashable, The New Republic, MIT Technology Review, and many more.<p>Get in touch with us directly at hello@parsely.com if you are interested -- mention HN and ask for Andrew.","time":1383340716,"type":"comment"}
