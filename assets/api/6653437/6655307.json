Most investment funds have a small data problem, they cannot make sense of 100&#x27;s of megabytes of data.  That is why off-the-shelf business intelligence solutions misses the problem completely.  We&#x27;re developing the solution our customers have been clamoring for.<p>Join our team of 5 people, and come make a big difference in an industry of dinosaurs.  Our existing customers are all very happy, and we have a ton more waiting for their rollout of the software.  We use Python&#x2F;Django&#x2F;Postgres on the backend and CoffeeScript with Backbone.Marionette on the frontend.  Our team is based in SF, but we&#x27;re happy to relocate you.<p>Get in touch: phil@rentlytics.com","time":1383329270,"type":"comment"}
