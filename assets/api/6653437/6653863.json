Our vision is to aggregate data from hundreds of open data portals, which can then be accessed in one place. You can see a very early demo of the application over here:<p><a href=\"http://www.stat.io/dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stat.io&#x2F;dev&#x2F;</a><p>The challenge is to understand millions of datasets from many different sources, from APIs to Excel files, and then provide an interface that allows users to find the data they&#x27;re interested in.<p>The main technologies we&#x27;re using for data processing are Python and MySQL, with a bit of Redis and MongoDB for some simple queueing and logging respectively. We&#x27;re open to using any technologies if it helps get us closer to our vision. For instance, there&#x27;s a good chance that alternative data stores to MySQL would be a better fit for the problems we face.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a software developer to join us, initially part-time. If you&#x27;re interested or have any questions, get in touch: contact@stat.io.<p>You can find out more about us on our website: <a href=\"http://www.stat.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stat.io&#x2F;</a>","time":1383315350,"type":"comment"}
