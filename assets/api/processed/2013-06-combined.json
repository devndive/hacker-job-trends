We have over 700,000 users and are on a $1.5m+ annual revenue run rate. There are some super interesting challenges ahead, as we are looking to pass a million users in 2013. We are expecting even faster growth in the coming months through our mobile efforts.<p>We need help on 2 areas right now:<p>1. Android:<p><pre><code>    - Android is our second highest source of signups for Buffer, only\n      trailing behind Web which was our original platform.\n    - our users love the app, which has a 4.3 rating on Google Play.\n    - the app has 100k+ total downloads and 3k daily active users.\n    - we work with Google Play, Kindle and Blackberry stores.\n</code></pre>\n2. Full stack:<p><pre><code>    - we get 1,500-2,000 signups per day on the web\n    - we have 170,000 weekly active users for our Chrome extension\n    - 4,500 API clients. Most popular: Feedly, IFTTT, Pocket, Instapaper\n    - we ship to production multiple times a day\n    - we have a data-driven process, with Einstein, our custom\n      built a/b testing framework\n    - ideally, experience in: PHP (Codeigniter)/Python, MongoDB,\n      Backbone.js Javascript, CSS, HTML\n</code></pre>\nWe're a small team of driven hackers and happiness heroes (our support people). Just like you, we're excited and passionate about engineering challenges and have some interesting architecture and scaling problems we work on.<p>If you're interested in coming on board, you will:<p><pre><code>    - work closely myself on Product and Sunil on technical\n      architecture\n    - ship to thousands of users and iterate quickly\n    - work with our metrics team to make smart changes\n    - be friendly and comfortable talking directly to customers\n      on issues and features\n    - be a happy, positive-minded and kind person who has a great\n      approach in dealing with others\n    - be a Buffer user (would be awesome, it’s cool if not)\n    - be anywhere in the world, and if you'd like, you have help and\n      support from us to move to where you want to be\n    - have experience working with another startup before (would\n      be awesome, it’s cool if not)\n</code></pre>\nSome aspects of Buffer culture that makes us a little different:<p><pre><code>    - we are totally transparent.

Ask me anything else!\n    - within the company, all salaries and equity are open and we\n      have a formula for the distribution.\n    - we're all very focused on self improvement - we have daily\n      standups where we discuss our current improvements.

Full time.<p>Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.<p>Many people believe that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:<p>- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.<p>- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.<p>- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the world’s scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.<p>- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world’s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world’s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.<p>It's an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas, based on the journal system, to a faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.<p>We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science. We have made a good start: 2.9 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 13,000 join each day. We're a 12 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, and Mongodb. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.<p>Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:<p>* full stack engineers * growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels)<p>There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at <a href=\"http://academia.edu/hiring\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://academia.edu/hiring</a>.

We use Django and jQuery, but you can learn these on the job. \nGood knowledge of at least one programming language. \nWe work primarily in Python and Javascript, but are happy for you to learn these on the job too. \nAn understanding of database programming and design. \nFamiliarity with *nix based operating systems. \nAwareness of popular web APIs, such as Google Maps, Twitter and Facebook. \nMore important than relevant experience is the drive to learn and expand your skill set.

We don't have a cookie cutter approach to the web and push the design and technical envelope on all our work. Recent projects have included: an application that manages, filters and analyses radio spectrum data from a series of nationally-located nodes; a responsive website for a high-end safari and Africa travel company; a large website and online admin system to manage the ever-changing attractions and events for an interactive science centre; and a website/application that tracks, maps and graphs the progress of University spin-out companies. Most of our projects are responsive and we're as committed to the front-end user experience as we are to what's happening under the hood.<p>&#62; How we work<p>As a team we listen, learn, plan, design, build, test and deliver together. Whilst different people are responsible for their own part of a project, we all understand the importance of the chain and support each other to get things done. You'll be expected to manage your own workload and you won't ever have a project manager breathing down your neck. Our process is front-loaded with in-depth research and discovery rounds in which both developers and designers participate. This keeps scope creep to a minimum and deadlines and budgets realistic. We don't subscribe to unnecessary bureacracy and keep things streamlined and agile. You'll get to talk to clients too - we all share the successes and the challenges of a project together.<p>&#62; Learning<p>The web is constantly evolving so we expect you to as well. Experimentation and learning new skills is part of the fabric at Onespacemedia. Need some books or course materials? No problem. Want to try out some new techniques on a test project? No problem. Something you want to tell the world about a technology or trend? Blog about it on the website. We expect our team members to be passionate and knowledgeable about their field of expertise.<p>&#62; Lifestyle<p>Working at Onespacemedia is fun. We do serious work for serious clients but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy it. Expect plenty of laughter, music, company lunches, trips to the pub and impromptu ping pong battles.

So, there is a lot of interesting work to be done.\n\n  - Modern HTML Applications: We’re very excited about  JavaScript frameworks that\n              have grown in popularity (like Angular.js, D3). We’re interested in\n              using web technologies for our mobile and desktop applications, so if\n              you’re experienced with (or just interested in) JavaScript, \n              CoffeeScript, SCSS, WebSockets, or BOSH, there’s a lot of research \n              and development to be done.\n\n  - Voice Technology: All calls using Ringio run through our voice systems to enable\n              things like on-hold music, call screening, and transfers.\n              We have a lot of new voice functionality that we’d like to build,\n              as well as technology we’d like to integrate. This is fairly unique to\n              our industry and involves some interesting timing, reliability,\n              concurrency, and state management problems.\n\n  - API Development: Integration with CRM systems and reselling partners requires APIs\n              for large pieces of our platform. We need help expanding our APIs, \n              making sure they’re usable and secure, and testing that they’re working\n              correctly.\n</code></pre>\nWe’re Looking For People Who Are:<p><pre><code>  - Smart software developers\n\n  - Familiar with object oriented programming. We use Grails and Java for our major\n    systems but are moving towards Go, Node.js for our service layer. We don't require\n    you know any of these languages, but expertise in *a* language is desired.\n    If you are interested in Go or node.js you should definitely get in touch.\n\n  - Familiar with Unix/Linux command-line systems. Logging into a Linux server to count\n    the number of ERROR lines in a log file grouped by hour wouldn’t be difficult\n    for you.\n\n  - Excited about joining a startup and wearing many hats.\n\n  - Authorized to work in the US\n\n  - Able to work from our Courthouse Metro office (flexibility to work from home\n    sometimes, but most time will be at the office)\n</code></pre>\nIf you're interested, email srijak AT ringio.com[1].<p>[1] Email should have your resume attached, have the string \"from hackernews\" somewhere in the subject line, and tell us why you think Ringio should hire you :)","time":1370095927,"type":"comment"},{"by":"jlaws","id":5845513,"parent":5803764,"text":"New York, NY.
