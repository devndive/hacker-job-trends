We were profitable last year are projected to explode in growth 2018. Looking for talented senior engineers to help keep up with demand. Email me if you&#x27;re interested: fahim@adquick.com<p>About AdQuick<p>* Founded by ex-Instacart engineers&#x2F;marketing \n* Raised $3M led by Initialized Capital (Garry Tan &amp; Alexis Ohanian, Reddit co-founder). \n* Our customers include great brands such as: Kevin Hart, Peloton, FanDuel, Drake, Lyft &amp; more.<p>Technical Stack<p>* Our tech stack is Rails 4, Webpack, React, Postgres, Heroku. \n* Looking for 3+ years experience in running production systems, ability to iterate quickly and sense of ownership. \n* Strong focus on user experience and putting the customer first.<p>Technical Challenges<p>* We have a complex frontend user interface. Users should be able to view 100,000+ markers and transit lines on a map without their browser crawling to a halt. We need to support complex and interesting map visualizations – layering political voting data, Census data, Foursquare data and more.<p>* We&#x27;re a search company. AdQuick conducts a search every time the user pans the map. Searching by geography, demographics, AdQuick score and a myriad of other attributes from disparate data sources is computationally expensive. It will be a challenge to scale while keeping search response times and server costs low.<p>* We&#x27;re a data science company. We integrate with Google Analytics &amp; AdWords and other data sources to measure impact of physical advertising on online behavior (CTR in a region). ROI data from prior campaigns can help create more effective future campaigns. As our data warehouse grows, crunching this data will be increasingly challenging and more powerful. We&#x27;ll use machine learning to create better campaigns overtime.<p>* Our backend systems have to deal with a myriad of inventory CSV, PDF formats, requiring robust and fast file validations, normalization and ingestion systems.<p>* We scraped Instagram and used image recognition to see if people shared photos of billboards. Turns out, a lot of people Instagram&#x27;d Drake&#x27;s board. Innovative ROI tools are a core part of our offering.","time":1522695860,"type":"comment"},{"by":"baspland","id":16737873,"kids":[16781658],"parent":16735011,"text":"Signal | SF or Remote (US only) | Full-Time | Software Engineers: iOS, Android, Server &amp; Web  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;signal.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;signal.org</a><p>Signal is making private communication simple.

It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale. School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing. Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.\nAt Clever, we’re working to change all that. We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.

Our primary product is an internal CRM, which is supported by tools we&#x27;ve created for body shops or car rental services and of course our mobile apps.<p>Worth highlighting: We have bi-weekly hack days, where we actually produce new products - nothing is left sitting on a local branch gathering dust. We have good benefits&#x2F;pay, unlimited PTO, and a team of smart people that genuinely enjoy each other.<p>For more information email me directly robert.goetz@snapsheet.me.

Researchers spend hours and sometimes days searching through published papers for guidance. But even then, many products they buy don&#x27;t work. Some aren&#x27;t right for a specific experiment. Others are poor quality. This delays scientific discoveries by weeks or months. And it slows availability of breakthrough treatments, while making them more expensive.<p>Apply here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benchsci.bamboohr.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benchsci.bamboohr.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a>","time":1522704170,"type":"comment"},{"by":"jduggins","id":16755969,"parent":16735011,"text":"DraftKings | Boston, MA | Full Time | ONSITE<p>DraftKings is a technology company that creates the most exciting digital sports competitions on the planet.

The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.<p>- Robustness. The goal here is to produce a set of signals around any given academic paper that indicate how robust the paper’s claims and findings are.<p>It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the academic literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis”. Peer review is not a robustness filter; we need a separate filter to indicate robustness.<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 19 million pdfs to Academia.edu. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to robustness, we think the way to build a robustness layer on top of papers is a) to mine the existing graph of citations for commentary and (b) crowd-source commentary&#x2F;peer review from the academic community.<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (b), and a citation graph infrastructure that is the basis of our approach to (a). We believe that addressing robustness is a challenge and an opportunity. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us.<p>We have raised $33 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. The company is profitable off a premium subscription model. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes &quot;We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world.&quot;<p>We are looking to hire full stack software engineers.

From there, they spec out the product in detail and get feedback from at least one other engineer. Once the initial version of the product is built they ship it to a small group of beta testers, gather feedback, and iterate. Once the product has shipped to production, this engineer is then responsible for monitoring the metrics that matter for this product and iterating to improve it. Since we&#x27;re building a product for engineers, we believe in letting our engineers work on things that interest them and giving them ownership over these products.<p>Interview process:<p>Phone Screen -&gt; Technical Homework -&gt; Technical Interviews -&gt; Product Interviews -&gt; Offer!<p>Check out our careers page: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackshare.io&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackshare.io&#x2F;careers</a> Apply via AngelList or email us at careers+HN@stackshare.io - if you&#x27;re emailing us please include your resume and&#x2F;or LinkedIn profile","time":1522708887,"type":"comment"},{"by":"xiaojenna","id":16788505,"parent":16735011,"text":"NLP Data Scientist\nShipamax (YC 17)<p>London, ONSITE<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;shipamax&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;shipamax&#x2F;jobs</a>","time":1523222741,"type":"comment"},{"by":"kevinwuhoo","id":16735258,"parent":16735011,"text":"10x Genomics | Software Engineer | San Francisco &amp; Pleasanton, CA | Onsite, 10xgenomics.com<p>We&#x27;re a biotech company developing novel software, hardware, and biochemical systems to give scientists new methods of discovering the mechanisms behind cancer and immunology.

It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.<p>We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here&#x27;s where we are now:<p>- We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.<p>- We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.<p>- Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.<p>- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.<p>- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.<p>- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.<p>Apply at hiring@narrative.io.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do “expense reports that don’t suck!” (Google “expensify” to read more.) We’re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren’s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it’s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won’t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn’t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We’ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and Uruguay. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We’re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you’re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you’re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out.<p>If you’re this sort of person, you’ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn’t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That’s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it’s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I’m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don’t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do “expense reports that don’t suck!” (Google “expensify” to read more.) We’re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren’s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it’s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won’t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn’t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We’ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and Uruguay. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We’re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you’re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you’re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you’re this sort of person, you’ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn’t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That’s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it’s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I’m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don’t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com.
