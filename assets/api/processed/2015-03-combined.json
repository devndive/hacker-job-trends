You will be in charge of writing tools, scripts, and libraries that collect utility data from utilities. Often these utility data formats are complex and unique to each utility (pdf bills, xml data, csv data, etc.), so you will need to be very clever in collecting and parsing a huge variety of formats. Also, these scripts can break unexpectedly when utilities change their interfaces, so being able to update them quickly is important.

Every day, people shake hands over million-dollar deals that can change the future of a company. From fundraising and acquisitions to partnerships, promotions and product placement, businesses get together and make new things happen. But there&#x27;s no platform for them; they typically overload sales-focused CRMs, or are stuck in the world of spreadsheets and email. We&#x27;re changing that. It&#x27;s a fascinating data problem as we&#x27;re mapping out professional and company-to-company networks, trying to understand who does business with whom and why, feeling our way around the underlying graph that nobody&#x27;s explicitly mapped out before. From old school tie to the boardroom, why do people do business with each other? What are the trust and influence networks? What&#x27;s the equivalent of PageRank for investors? What does it mean when a VP moves from one company to another? How do I get my startup funded?<p>We&#x27;re trying to answer all these questions.

New York City. Sunnyvale.<p>Application Security Consultant<p>Full-Time or Internship, work visa sponsorship available<p>..............*________________________________________________________<p><pre><code>   &lt;Mission Impossible theme plays&gt;\n</code></pre>\nThis thread will, no doubt, be dominated by posts with laundry lists of requirements.  Many employers will introduce themselves by describing what they want from you.  At Matasano, we&#x27;re a little different.  We like to start by telling you about us.  This month, I want to try to do that by drawing analogy to Mission Impossible.<p>What made the original show so great is exactly what was lost in the &#x27;Tom Cruise takes on the world&#x27; reboot. The original 1960&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s Mission Impossible was defined primarily by a team working together against all odds to achieve their objective.  It acknowledged that what they were doing was improbable, and more so for a solo James Bond or Tom Cruise character. As a team though, each character an expert in their particular focus area, the incredible became credible -- the impossible, possible.<p>Working at Matasano is a bit like working for the Impossible Missions Force (IMF).  No, we&#x27;re not taking out thinly veiled cold war era Soviet stand in villains, preventing the rise of the third reich, or being tasked with gathering evidence against criminals &quot;outside the reach of conventional law enforcement.&quot;  But in many cases, we&#x27;re given tight timelines and tasked with difficult objectives.  To the uninitiated, what we do is often seen as impossible, but _together_ we do it every day.<p>Imagine you (and your team) have a month to circumvent a real world cryptographic system designed and sold for Fortune 500 companies to protect their most sensitive intellectual property.  Maybe you&#x27;re given a week to investigate and undercover flaws in a brand new Ruby on Rails application.  You might find yourself facing a never-before-seen client&#x2F;server application, implementing a proprietary binary protocol, and having to figure it out and attack it.  You could end up drawing on binary reverse engineer skills, or reviewing Java code.  But whatever the &#x27;mission&#x27;, you won&#x27;t be alone.  You&#x27;ll be part of a team of experts, each bringing their own skill set to the team.<p>We don&#x27;t have very much call for demolitions experts, special effects makeup artists, or champion weightlifters.  Like the IMF, we&#x27;re looking for people with diverse backgrounds who each bring something unique to the team. There&#x27;s little in computing that isn&#x27;t useful for an Application Security Consultant.  We need Reverse Engineers. Developers of all backgrounds, Cryptographers, Electrical Engineers, you name it.  We&#x27;re as likely to hire a Mathematics PHD as a college drop out.  Many of our best employees have little formal information technology background.  In short, we come from a variety of backgrounds, but share one common trait -- We&#x27;re curious about nearly everything, and have a wide base of knowledge, but have achieved mastery over one (or more) disciplines.  These are the sorts of people the IMF built their team from, and they&#x27;re the sort of people who we&#x27;re looking for at Matasano.<p>Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to visit www.matasano.com&#x2F;careers to learn more and contact us.  In the enclosed dossier, you&#x27;ll find links to www.cryptopals.com and www.microcorruption.com which may be of interest.  Further intelligence is available at the chargen.matasano.com blog, and you can always contact careers@matasano.com with any remaining questions.  As always, should any member of your team be caught or killed, the Secretary will disavow all knowledge of your actions.<p>This isn&#x27;t Mission Difficult, it&#x27;s Mission Impossible.

It&#x27;s also really fast; we&#x27;re near the top of the New Relic leaderboard for our category and in the 90th percentile of site speed according to Google. We take pride in what we built, and we&#x27;re looking for someone who is proud of their work to continue what we&#x27;ve started.<p>We&#x27;re seeking a developer who can spend approximately 20 hours a week working on discrete, meaningful projects on the site.

We expect you to generate good HTML structure but if you never touch our CSS or fiddle with images, that&#x27;s fine by us. Same goes for setting up servers, patching PHP, etc. We&#x27;ve got that all covered.<p>The ideal candidate will be able to show us what they&#x27;ve done using the technologies listed above. Experience with Laraval (likely future framework) and&#x2F;or Kohana ideal, but not required. Honesty and strong communication skills are critical. Comfort with Github, pull requests, and the git toolchain generally is important -- we&#x27;ll ask for your Github username when we consider your application.

We use computer vision at a massive scale, on a large number of rich and ubiquitous video feeds, to understand what is going in in the physical world in real time. We measure how busy places are, what people do, how fast cars go, and much more. We offer that data to developers, citizens, cities, and retailers, radically changing the way they interact with the physical world.<p>We built our platform around privacy. We never store any video and we do not identify people. We also make sure no one can reverse engineer our data to identify anyone. We are backed by top NYC &amp; Silicon Valley VCs, alumna of TechStars (Spring 2013), and actively plugged into their vibrant ecosystem of mentors and alumni.<p>We need creative and flexible minds, with a complete commitment to building nothing else but perfect software and systems.

You will encounter some of the biggest tech challenges you have ever seen. Get ready to earn some serious tech street cred.<p>We are a paradise for video and data geeks. Using our own optimized code base, we detect moving objects, classify them, then track their positions. We then use trajectory information to estimate speed as well as location occupancy and traffic. Today, our computer vision stack runs continuously on close to 1,000 available video feeds, collecting 8 million data points each day on average. We extract insights and predictions from these points. We have millions of ground truth data points to build and optimize our algorithms. We analyze all these data points by comparing them, normalizing them, correlating them with external factors to give our users clean, real time data. We are about to grow dramatically, adding a couple of orders of magnitude to our current scale.<p>We work in a data driven environment where every new algorithm is first defined by data sets and ground truth - we have a lot of data floating around. Our regression and quality tests guarantee that each improvement on one camera will improve our quality and performance overall.<p>We highly value testing and continuous integration. For critical interactions between major components we maintain integration tests, and for our core algorithms we maintain quality and regression tests. Good test coverage is key to keeping our bug count low. It also builds internal confidence to work on any piece of code without fear of breaking existing functionalities.<p>Our tech team is made up of varied backgrounds, and we function as a flat team where everybody knows about what everyone else is working on.

We say THAT&#x27;S TOO LONG TO WAIT. And that&#x27;s why we go out and buy a fan, so we don&#x27;t have to wait on some stupid butterfly to wake up and flap. We alter the wind IMMEDIATELY. BECAUSE THAT&#x27;S THE SORT OF PEOPLE WE ARE!!!<p>Are you like us? Do you enjoy working on challenging problems that directly impact and empower customers at a massive scale? Are you interested in innovating and engineering services and website platforms that power our business operations? Are you sick to death of empowering some no-good butterfly? DO YOU WANT TO STICK YOUR HEAD OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SCREAM &quot;I&#x27;M PASSIONATE ABOUT FRONT END AND BACK END DEVELOPMENT AND I&#x27;M NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANY MORE&quot;?!?!? If so, maybe this is your kinda place, yeah? Yeah. YEAH. YEAH.<p>In this job, you’ll learn: that Mr. Tibetan Butterfly isn&#x27;t so bad, really. He&#x27;s just a butterfly trying to get by in the world. In fact, you two would really get along. Maybe you should go get a few drinks together some weeknight. Watch the game. You know, talk it out.<p>Intangible benefits: A chance to build great software for customers. Have you ever touched software? Huh? If you said yes, you&#x27;re WRONG. You touched the device on which the software is stored. Just like a story. Or a poem. Or song. Or your memories of childhood.<p>Potential hazards: If you start talking about poems and songs and your memories of childhood too much, someone&#x27;s gonna punch you in the arm. So just be warned.<p>If Woot were a superhero team, you’d be: yeah, funny thing. There aren&#x27;t yet a lot of superheroes who got their powers after being bitten by a mobile app. But the moment a hero like that shows up? That&#x27;ll be you. That&#x27;ll be you all the way.<p>Worst part of the job: when the butterfly shows up drunk and starts ranting about how people don&#x27;t take him seriously as a weather controlling device. He&#x27;ll try to convince you that HAARP is just twenty billion butterflies strapped to a board. Just smile and nod. Smile and nod.<p>Make sure you bring: a custom printed purple shirt that reads &quot;I got tricked into wearing this by the guy who writes the job descriptions.&quot; Wear it.
