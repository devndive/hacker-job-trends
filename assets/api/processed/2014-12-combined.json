The name comes the LXC technology (Linux Containers), and the technique is also known as &quot;Lightweight Virtualization&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s why we recently launched Docker (<a href=\"http://www.docker.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.docker.com&#x2F;</a>) &amp; Docker Hub (<a href=\"http://hub.docker.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hub.docker.com</a>), an Open Source tool enabling anyone to run those Linux Containers very easily &amp; a community Hub for the community to organize, share and create images publicly as well as privately. Containers boot 1000x faster than virtual machines; their disk and memory footprint are also much lower; and they work on virtually all current platforms (from physical servers to public cloud instances). We think that they are the future of virtualization, and will soon become ubiquitous.<p>Convinced?

Every day, people shake hands over million-dollar deals that can change the future of a company. From fundraising and acquisitions to partnerships, promotions and product placement, businesses get together and make new things happen. But there&#x27;s no platform for them; they typically overload sales-focused CRMs, or are stuck in the world of spreadsheets and email. We&#x27;re changing that.\nIt&#x27;s a fascinating data problem as we&#x27;re mapping out professional and company-to-company networks, trying to understand who does business with whom and why, feeling our way around the underlying graph that nobody&#x27;s explicitly mapped out before. From old school tie to the boardroom, why do people do business with each other? What are the trust and influence networks? What&#x27;s the equivalent of PageRank for investors? What does it mean when a VP moves from one company to another? How do I get my startup funded?\nWe&#x27;re trying to answer all these questions.

Teachers would love to use programs like these, but synchronizing data between their school’s database and external software applications is a huge problem that results in wasted time at the start of class and frustrated, bored students… which leads to software being abandoned entirely.  80% of K-12 teachers would use more software in classes if getting students logged in weren’t such a hassle, and a quarter of all class time that’s supposed to be dedicated to software is wasted on logins alone.<p>Developers have a similar problem: they love clean APIs, but in the education industry, they haven’t had one.  Most K-12 schools house their student data in ancient legacy databases that make integrations a nightmare.  If you’re a five-person startup and you’ve built an app that revolutionizes the way third-graders learn fractions, there’s simply no way to get your product in front of students.<p>Clever is solving these problems by building a modern, developer-friendly API for schools… which we give them for free.  Developers love being able to plug into schools without having to write a complex integration for every single district they’re working with, so they pay us for access to the platform.  This business model has helped us grow quickly; we’re now in 1 in 5 schools in America (over 29,000 schools), and our product is used by millions of students every day.<p>Our goal is to become the education identity company.  The first step in that direction is our Instant Login single sign-on platform: a universal login that allows students to access all of their learning applications in one place.

New York City. Sunnyvale. \nJob Title: Application Security Consultant<p>-- .- - .- ... .- -. ---    ... . -.-. ..- .-. .. - -.--<p>Once a professor shared a piece of career advice with me.  &quot;Don&#x27;t call yourself a coder,&quot; he said, &quot;anyone can learn to code, but programming takes real skill.&quot;  His words have stuck with me since.  Coding was, in his description, the mere act of producing something a computer can interpret and act upon.  Programming, however, seeks elegance and simplicity through considered design and thought that transcends the code itself.  While both take skill, the goals are different and they can be thought of as distinct disciplines.<p>Application Security, I&#x27;ve come to believe, is yet another discipline with a slightly different focus.  &#x27;Coders&#x27; focus almost exclusively on iterating until they achieve a desired result. &#x27;Programmers&#x27; might test and refine to improve performance and reduce resource consumption. But with an Application Security perspective, we instead look at unintended functionality and edge cases that give rise to problems; &#x27;What if&#x27; scenarios involving abuse cases that weren&#x27;t part of the original design.  It&#x27;s yet another way of looking at the same application, with a different goal and different outcome.<p>At Matasano, we don&#x27;t build software, we break it.  We find, exploit, document, and prioritize flaws so the application&#x27;s developers can address them.  We identify when security controls are effective, and note areas for improvement.  We review use cases, identify abuse cases, and help guide future development efforts. We work across a wide variety of applications ranging from simple web apps, to complex hardware appliances. From HTTP to proprietary encrypted protocols, and everything in between.  As a team, we&#x27;re as comfortable with ROP chains and memory corruption vulnerabilities as Cross-Site Scripting and SQL Injection.  As individuals, we excel in our areas of focus while cross-training and broadening our skills.  We&#x27;re among the leaders in our industry and community, and give back through research, tools, and practice environments.<p>If improving the state of software security while kicking up some dirt in the process seems like fun, check us out.

Our service enables these companies to provide instant quotes and continuous monitoring of their customers savings, which lowers soft costs and accelerates the sustainable energy industry.<p>==Job Description==<p>You will be in charge of writing tools, scripts, and libraries that translate utility data formats to our API format. Often these utility data formats are complex and unique to each utility (pdf bills, xml data, csv data, etc.), so you will need to be very clever in collecting and parsing a huge variety of formats.

Ideally you are a polyglot. We will be making web interfaces so of course JS&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;CSS skills are required. You know or are not afraid to get to know C&#x2F;other low level languages. You have used relational databases, and at least have looked into some non-relational database. Column oriented database experience a plus! You have used MVC frameworks before (Django&#x2F;Rails&#x2F;Laravel&#x2F;etc), and have used at least one Javascript framework. You enjoy writing clean readable code and don&#x27;t mind getting rid of old code when it&#x27;s the right thing to do. You haven&#x27;t used some_random_technology? Great! We&#x27;ll likely be using a lot of that. This means you don&#x27;t mind reading docs and source code and learning quickly. Version control is a must. We use Git.<p>Important Non-tech Factors<p>You live in NYC or would if the job is interesting enough. An experimental mindset and a curiosity for all tech interesting. Good communications skills and personal accountability are a must. When things go wrong, tell people and fix them. As the team expands we will do some light code-review to mitigate the bus-factor. Experience working in a startup is a plus.\nTechnical Nice-to-Haves (not required in any sense but might come in handy&#x2F;be interesting)<p>Working with&#x2F;messing around with Unity or other gaming&#x2F;3D engines. Prior experience with Arduino&#x2F;other hardware prototyping. Experience with hardware&#x2F;EE. Familiarity with Machine Learning.<p>Don&#x27;t hit all the bullet points? Apply anyways, it would be totally unreasonable to expect someone to have all of the above, we&#x27;re really more concerned about finding smart devs who think this sounds like a really interesting project.

This started a year ago out of Startup Weekend where we were finalists.  Since then, we&#x27;ve pitched live at TC Disrupt NY, Startup Fest, and recently finished a Series A fundraise (pitched to 30+ investors).<p>My short bio:<p>About this time last year, GradFly was only a couple months old.  I raised a small seed round, incorporated the business (which I thought had no legs), and had just brought on our first hire.  I&#x27;ve been checking out Reddit for some time and have received some good feedback from the rapid prototyping community which will contine to grow.<p>What is GradFly?<p>We are building an online community and repository for hardware&#x2F;software projects - from Arduino, Raspberry Pi, 3D printing, drones, version control for PCBs,  to designs in sync with code, etc. Basically, hardware and software developers join forces to work on specific hardware projects. (Say John Smith posts a project to have two arduinos communicate using WiFi Direct and he is seeking help on the WiFi part while he focuses on the motor controller stuff.)  He is willing to pay $350 to have someone work with him in parallel and speed up the project. Anyone can submit a project. We help faciliate connections and find resources, talent, and example projects to help with products or concepts that the community is trying to create.<p>Current stats: (We are still a very young company)<p>Based in Buffalo, NY\n400+ users (mostly early adopters);\nSome revenue but recently changed models to accomodate user growth;\nTeam of 2;\nCurrently part of Startup Next Toronto (Sponsored by Google Entrepreneurs);\nWaitlisted at TechStars NYC this past summer. (Made top 15);\nPartners with maker spaces, fablabs, diybio communities, and garage type groups;\nJust finished raising $700k.  (raised  $200k last year)<p>As you can see, I&#x27;m pretty transparent about things like this.  I like to keep everyting out in the open.<p>My Background:<p>Worked in Western NY for the last five years before founding GradFly.  Started in grants, college admissions, and makerspaces before throwing in the towel to become founder.  Learned to code Python on CodeAcademy and have since been improving over time. Just started tinkering with Arduino and Hummingbird. I row and swim competitvely to keep my sanity. I also speak Spanish and French.<p>Who I&#x27;m looking for:<p>Up until now, I&#x27;ve relied mostly on part-time and student developer talent to help me build GradFly. I&#x27;ve been grateful but with this recent fundraise, I need to raise the bar a tad bit.  I&#x27;m looking for folks who can and want to commit full-time to an early-stage company with room for growth and various opportunities.  I&#x27;m also looking for individuals that are passionate about where the open hardware&#x2F;software movement is heading. It&#x27;s hard to try and explain it to someone if they&#x27;re not immersed in it already. I&#x27;ve done the whole remote thing and it didn&#x27;t work out - therefore I&#x27;m looking for someone who would be willing to relocate given the right package and circumstances. I can be flexible for someone who is very curious and wants to spend a little of time figuring out a move like this.<p>All in all, I&#x27;m looking for three people:<p>1) Lead Engineer, potential CTO - (Backend) - The site is Python backend in flask using s3 for asset storage along with rabbitmq and celery for messaging and tasks. We are using redis and Postgres for temp storage&#x2F;caching and database respectively.  Currently on github using wrecker for CI and builds to deploy to heroku - where everything is hosted. We&#x27;re looking for someone who is familiar with these stacks yet is willing to push the envelope and try new things. The foundation is there, now we just need to build on top of it.<p>2) Frontend Engineer&#x2F;Designer - Frontend is built with grunt and is split between foundation and bootstrap templates with jinja2.  Styling is done in less and stylus, and we&#x27;re using plain old JavaScript and jquery.  The design on the site currently lacks but it&#x27;s only uphill from here. We have ideas about what we&#x27;d like to see but we&#x27;re open to different kinds of aesthetics out there.<p>3) Marketing&#x2F;Business Dev - Really looking for someone who has an understanding of this space and knows how to build a community and identify the right channels for hypergrowth.  So far we&#x27;ve been presenting at all types of events (makerfaires, trade showes, fablabs), reaching out to influencers, and spreading more awareness about ourselves.  The person who joins us on this end would continue to help us address the number one pain point we&#x27;re addressing.  Must be willing to travel across US, Europe, and Asia.<p>PM me with your portfolio.  Really looking forward to connecting with anyone that this might resonate with.<p>Thanks in advance for reading.

We train pretty good people with technical backgrounds into fully-employable data scientists, probably the fastest growing profession right now. We are about to start our second batch, profitable, and growing. If you have an exceptional network of companies, in the Valley or in the EU, we need you. Bringing companies to our hiring day, and getting them to happily leave with their new data science hire will be your job.\nDoes your network include lots of companies hiring data scientists? We need you. You have lived and worked in the US, preferrably in the Valley, and are plugged in.\nThe director of DSR cofounded a startup with a Ycombinator alumn, so it&#x27;s not like we have zero network in the Valley, but this requires far more effort than we can allocate right now with the current team. If you are reading this from SF, and thinking about moving to Berlin, this is a good opportunity.\nThere are about 10x more data science jobs in the US than in EU, so our goal for the next batches is to serve the US market. We think the education we provide is top-notch, we just need to get noticed by companies hiring from the US.\nIf you are well-connected in EU, and know how to get to talk with exactly the right person at the right company: we need you.

Towards the end we provide a networking event with top-tier technology companies, where you will show off your new skills and portfolio project, likely leaving with a career-changing job.\nWe&#x27;re looking for someone to take charge of operations, accounting, and event coordination at Data Science Retreat.\nThis job will entail everything from managing our office space to handling inbound email to planning group alumni events to working with our lawyer and accountant. It will also entail working closely with the founder. Since we are a small team, everyone has significant responsibility and helps define and determine our future growth and success.\nYou will get to meet lots of interesting people and companies, and be at the center of the data science action in EU.&quot;\nFind out more about DSR and apply at <a href=\"http://datascienceretreat.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;datascienceretreat.com&#x2F;</a>\nWe are profitable from day one and growing.<p>What makes you a strong candidate in our eyes?\n•\tYou have a network with the type of companies who are looking for a data scientist right now.\n•\tYou can talk to anyone, get access to the decision maker, and get him on the phone\n•\tYou identify with data-driven companies, and can speak their language\n•\tYou have worked at a company that was data-driven, or whose main product was data\n•\tYou have been in teams that included a data scientist\n•\tIf you are applying for the EU position, you need good spoken German (native or close).\n•\tYou don&#x27;t need to live in Berlin, but it&#x27;d be a plus\nWhat we offer:\n•\tMeaningful work, with a huge effect on people&#x27;s lives.

Because you have a working understanding of all aspects of the architecture, you will be tasked with developing individual components of the product in different arenas as needed. For example, in one sprint you may be working on a new set of endpoints in a Node.js API, and the next may code a developer-facing component using accelerometer data in C. You are the “slash” on our team; you’re the unfair advantage, someone that likes to work on a lot of different things and is always up for a challenge. You take pride in being a jack-of-all-trades, and are up for mastering a few along the way. \nAt Strap, we follow a fairly rigorous agile development process. You are expected to communicate your progress “stand-up” style daily while maintaining your work in feature branches with frequent commits. The goal is not to add meaningless processes to your plate; rather, we believe that communication and transparency are two extremely important factors in a successful development team.<p>SKILLS\nPython, Javascript, Android, MongoDB, Node.js, iOS Development, Amazon Web Services, Meteor<p>COMPENSATION\nFull Time\n$50K – $70K Salary\n0.25% – 1.0% Equity<p>--------------------------------------------------------------<p>DATA SCIENTIST<p>DESCRIPTION\nStrap is looking for a Data Scientist to join our growing team in Cincinnati, Ohio’s historic Over-The-Rhine neighborhood.

You are a very strong technologist, and this gives you the skills needed to answer a variety of questions about the data we have today. However, your business acumen and creative nature give you the ability to derive your own questions and insights about the data as you analyze it. You may develop ad-hoc reports, or create recurring batch jobs using tools like Python and MATLAB.

DocNav is launching a product that solves a unique problem in the legal technology space, but whose applications range well beyond law firms to include hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate firms, investment banks, and beyond. More broadly, the mission of the company is to bring technology to bear on problems that professionals in finance, investment, and law don’t even know they have.<p>### The Product<p>DocNav makes large, complex legal and financial documents interactive and easy to navigate and untangle. The product is simple to use and intuitive, but results in a very powerful user experience with a learning curve that is almost zero. The idea and design are based on my own 15-year career in the private equity and hedge fund business and the product is something I wanted but could not find.<p>The current product is in private beta and getting a strong response from the hedge fund community. It has so far been described as ‘magic’ and ‘legendary’ by guys who don’t often use the words ‘magic’ and ‘legendary’ for professional services. Applications of the product are far ranging and user segments include hedge funds, private equity funds, asset management firms, investment banks, in-house counsel’s offices, COO’s and CFO’s, and law firms ranging from top 20 “white-shoe” firms to small and medium size offices.<p>### The Position<p>This is a chance to build a unique product with far-ranging applications that could develop in numerous different directions. I want to work with someone who is excited to solve nerdy engineering and design problems, and who will proactively suggest solutions or new directions.<p>You will be on a lean team with lots of interesting things to work on, including developing and refining algorithms to make sense of unstructured documents, refining an elegant user experience, hacking growth to increase the user base, and helping turn a beta product into a truly enterprise-grade, scalable, secure application. Experience with or an interest in natural language processing and machine learning methods is a plus, but the most important thing is an ability to creatively solve technical problems.<p>No BS environment, let’s create a great product and see where it takes us, there are tons of directions this could go.<p>### About Me<p>I’m an electrical engineer by schooling but spent my entire career working for hedge funds and private equity firms doing everything from leverage buyouts and growth investments to trading structured credit bonds. I left the business because I was more interested in bringing technology to bear on all kinds of problems that exist at financial firms. I have built the product myself up to this point, but now I want to build a team and need a talented engineer and a teammate to take the product to the next level and push forward with product development, user growth, and revenue generation in the near term.<p>### Current Development Stack<p>- Python &#x2F; Django\n- AWS EC2, S3, RDS (Postgres)\n- HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript (though we will have outside development help on front end design and implementation, I need a real engineer to figure out deeper solutions for architecting and implementing new killer features)\n- Backbone.js<p>### Compensation<p>Competitive compensation package consisting of salary plus equity.<p>### Contact<p>Please send resumes to rishi@docnavlab.com, www.docnavapp.com","time":1417483503,"type":"comment"},{"deleted":true,"id":8685164,"parent":8681040,"time":1417483175,"type":"comment"},{"by":"meric","id":8684754,"parent":8681040,"text":"Our company is hiring in Cape Town, South Africa.<p>Send me an email at eric@gradconnection.com!<p>================================================================================<p>Senior Django Developer - Team Lead<p>We&#x27;re a site for university graduates to find graduate positions.<p>GradConnection is expanding fast as a ambitious, profitable and easy-going\ncompany.

We have a lot we want to accomplish, and want to continue building a positive, dynamic, and diverse team to help ensure our vision flourishes.<p>## Our plans<p>KA Lite has now been installed thousands of times in over 130 countries (<a href=\"https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/map/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learningequality.org&#x2F;ka-lite&#x2F;map&#x2F;</a>), in contexts as varied as low-income schools in India, orphanages in Cameroon, prisons across the United States, refugee programs in Lebanon, and First Nations community centers in northern Canada. We plan to continue developing KA Lite, adding features and improving the user experience, and supporting deployments around the world.<p>Next up, we are preparing for the development of a platform, building upon the KA Lite codebase, that will empower users to create, curate, share, and learn from diverse forms of openly licensed content, in both online and offline environments. This will involve building tools for authoring videos and exercises, an app ecosystem for embedding and distributing HTML5 educational bundles, features for discovering and communicating with other devices peer-to-peer over a local network, interfaces and web-based visualizations for exploring student data, and systems for motivating, engaging, and guiding learners.<p>## About you<p>* You care deeply about making the world a better place, believe in the power of learning, strive to promote equality, and resonate with our statement of core values (<a href=\"https://learningequality.org/about/values/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learningequality.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;values&#x2F;</a>).<p>* You are comfortable in a leadership role, e.g. taking responsibility for a core component of a project, and mentoring students, interns, and contractors.<p>* You love to build things, and like to think carefully about how best to serve user needs.<p>* You have skills and experience with web development&#x2F;design, hopefully using some subset of the following stack: Python, Django, HTML5, Javascript, Backbone.js, and CSS&#x2F;LESS (visual design tools also a plus).<p>* FLE is still a small startup, and we each wear many hats, and thus experience in any of the following areas would be valued (though in no way required): Education (e.g. teaching), Networking (protocols, APIs, etc), Databases (schemas, efficiency, replication, etc), Hardware sourcing (finding providers, bulk ordering, build-to-order processes), Quality Assurance (automated and&#x2F;or manual testing).<p>## About the job<p>* We&#x27;re looking to fill a full-time position (likely starting with a 3-month trial contract, as negotiated), with a modest salary, 401(k) matching, and health care options. If you feel you might not yet have enough experience for the full-time position, but are excited about what we&#x27;re doing, contact us anyway, as we have an internship program that could be a way to learn, and get your foot in the door!<p>* We offer flexible schedules and vacation time. We emphasize a healthy work-life balance, accomplishing as much as we can while also taking care of ourselves and our families, and having fun!<p>* Your exact title in the organization would be determined in collaboration with you, on the basis of the skills you bring to the table, and the focus of the role you&#x27;ll be playing on the team.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We just got back from Portugal...where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http://we.are.expensify.com/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com&#x2F;apply</a>).<p>We are excited to hear from you!","time":1417450399,"type":"comment"},{"by":"ssk2","dead":true,"id":8684344,"parent":8681040,"text":"Mesosphere - <a href=\"https://mesosphere.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mesosphere.com&#x2F;jobs</a> - San Francisco, CA INTERN, VISA<p>We&#x27;re a fast growing and well funded distributed systems &#x2F; enterprise tech &#x2F; infrastructure startup in San Francisco.
