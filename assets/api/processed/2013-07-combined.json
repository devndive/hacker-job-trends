The number of businesses using OpenStack in general and Swift in particular grows and grows, and it includes big names that make products that are used by both your little brother and your grandmother. You’ll work on a product that makes core OpenStack technology accessible to businesses of all kinds.<p>You’ll get open-source experience in a big way.

Writing a system like Swift and building a software ecosystem to surround it is the road less traveled. We aren’t writing yet another glorified CMS or social app or phone game. Whether it’s figuring out better algorithms for data placement, confronting a firehose of monitoring data, or determining how to integrate most flexibly with customers’ systems, there are always new and unusual problems to solve.<p>Interested?

Every business generates data. We help our clients uncover the stories hidden in their data and transform them into something new and valuable. Clients include Timex, Garmin and Nottingham City Transport.<p>At Base you will be part of a team of makers and doers, working across a variety of projects and clients. We&#x27;re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.<p>We value and support CPD, actively seeking clients with a like-minded desire to push boundaries, providing you with an opportunity to build your experience and skills. We practice a sustainable pace, recognising that we each have lives and families outside of work. Late nights and &gt; 40 hour weeks are rare by design.<p>About the role:<p>1st class front-end. You will be used to working as part of an unsilo&#x27;d production team, where designers work alongside developers, in agile sprints where they&#x27;re useful. Your main skill set is bringing concept artwork to life, turning designs (as Photoshop &amp; InDesign files) into working HTML&#x2F;CSS, using JavaScript. You&#x27;ll be comfortable with canvas, SVG and graphical JavaScript libraries such as D3.js (and may have dabbled with WebGL).

You&#x27;ll have a keen interest in visualising datasets, with a good understanding of what makes information beautiful. You&#x27;ll know that an infographic is only as good as the moment it was created. Turning great designs into live visualisations showing real data will be something that excites you.<p>Open all hours.

Full time.<p>Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company&#x27;s mission is to accelerate the world&#x27;s research.<p>Many people believe that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:<p>- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.<p>- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.<p>- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the world’s scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.<p>- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world’s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world’s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.\nIt&#x27;s an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas, based on the journal system, to a faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.<p>We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science. We have made a good start: 2.9 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 13,000 join each day. We&#x27;re a 12 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, and Mongodb. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.\nFamiliarity with our technologies is a plus, but it&#x27;s not essential. It&#x27;s far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:\n* full stack engineers * growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels)\nThere is more information about the company on our hiring page, at <a href=\"http://academia.edu/hiring\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;academia.edu&#x2F;hiring</a>.

In doing so we’re looking for an experienced Lead Developer to help confront these as part of a great founding team.

Once those features are live, you should be at home making data-based decisions about their future direction and flaws.<p>Autonomous: Though decisions are made as a team, you’ll be in charge of making sure we deliver on all things tech.

We like people who are full stack, and like learning about all areas of the product.<p>I am a full-stack dev, so I do everything from tuning database queries to Rails to JavaScript to visual design on my features, its pretty damn rewarding and interesting.<p>Working on the product development team is pretty great.

We have a neat office space in downtown San Mateo that is open and perfect for a team of programmers (we keep the noise down when we&#x27;re working). We are two blocks from the San Mateo CalTrain station, we have plenty of room for bikes, and free parking passes if you want to drive.<p>We have had remote developers for a long time, across the country and world. We also allow for working from home as needed for local people (or wherever else you are productive), and we strongly encourage people to go home and rest if they look tired or don&#x27;t feel well.<p>We offer good pay, great health &#x2F; dental &#x2F; vision insurance, unlimited vacation, extremely flexible hours (pretty much be in by 11am if you are local). We have &quot;field trip&quot; lunches on Wednesdays to get the team together and relax, and other days we might walk to the park or somewhere downtown for lunch.<p>Please email a quick intro and your resume, website, or github to * brianfarr@gmail.com * if you are interested or have any questions.<p>If you seem like a good possibility, your resume will be seen by my manager and the team early this week. If not, I will try my best to point you to someplace you are a good fit, or connect you with recruiters I know. Also, if you are new or looking to move to the SF Bay Area and want to talk to someone who did it last year, from the midwest, send me an email too.<p>(P.S. - We have already hired one Rails engineer from an HN Who&#x27;s Hiring post).","time":1372691738,"type":"comment"},{"by":"greghinch","id":5971068,"parent":5970187,"text":"We Are Pop Up - London, UK - Web Application Developer (full-time)<p>We Are Pop Up is a community-driven marketplace for short-term commercial property leasing. While we certainly didn&#x27;t invent the concept of a &quot;pop up shop&quot;, we&#x27;re embracing it whole-heartedly as a solution to two social problems which have arisen in our  time: 1) How can we lower the barrier-to-entry to enable a new generation of retail, food, and creative entrepreneurs to operate as easily in the offline world as businesses currently do online? 2) As commerce increasingly moves online, vacant property is left behind, which can have detrimental effects on both the nearby businesses and the greater community alike. How can we find new ways of filling that space? The missing piece which transforms these two real problems into mutual solutions is an excellent software platform that removes the time and overhead typically associated with commercial leasing. We Are Pop Up officially launched this platform near the end of 2012, and has already given numerous creative entrepreneurs around the UK opportunities to engage the offline world in ways they never had before.<p>We&#x27;re looking for an experienced Web Application Developer to work directly along side our Lead Developer and Creative Director, building features and scaling the platform. Someone who&#x27;s comfortable working with the whole stack, understands the principles of excellent software development, and wants to treat their code as their craft.

We use Postgres, but are happy with MySQL or similar experience<p>* Ability to work in Javascript&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;CSS. We use YUI 3 and Bootstrap. You certainly don&#x27;t need to be a designer, but you should be able to take on a feature and fully implement it, including all relevant front-end code<p>* General understanding of Solr&#x2F;Lucene search<p>* Experience deploying basic server infrastructure and with the Unix command line (being an expert SysAdmin is not required)<p>* Familiarity with code profiling and optimization<p>* Interested in things like Agile development, TDD, and pair-programming<p>* Work equally well in close coordination with others and independently&#x2F;self-directed.
