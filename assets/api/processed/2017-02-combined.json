It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after four years, half of all schools in the US (68,000 schools) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of just over 100 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Golang, Node and React.

Because the most clinically complicated cases in a patient population tend to drive a majority of the costs, even seemingly small improvements in these patients’ well-being have dramatic benefits for the care provider. Wellframe focuses on improving patient health by providing personalized and adaptive care programs for people trying to recover from or manage serious health problems. We use the health data we collect in order to intelligently allot care resources to the specific needs of patients, paying special attention to the most-critical patients. Through clinical studies and working with large healthcare payers, we have seen that our platform improves patient outcomes, increases the capacity of care management teams and reduces costs of the care provider. We have a relatively small engineering team at about 10 engineers. What makes us unique is that we have a full time clinical team of doctors that work with us to break down clinical science so that we can build it back up into personalized and adaptive care programs.<p>We&#x27;re currently looking for several mid&#x2F;senior engineering positions (android, iOS, frontend, backend, infra&#x2F;platform, sre) across our engineering team.

The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.<p>- The reproducibility crisis. It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the scientific literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis&quot;<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 16 million pdfs to Academia.edu, and upload about 1 million a month. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to reproducibility, we think the way to solve the reproducibility crisis is to build a new peer review system that (a) crowd-sources peer review from the academic community and (b) provides credit to material that journals don&#x27;t publish (data-sets, code, replications, failed replications).<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (a) and (b). We realize that addressing reproducibility is a huge challenge. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us.

We believe functional programming (and specifically, OCaml) helps us do that. But it’s not about productivity alone: programming in a rich and expressive language like OCaml is just more fun. We’re also happy to spend time and money on making it easier for the people here to get things done. This ranges from big projects, like the work we do on development tools (e.g. Iron, our in-house code review and release management system, and Merlin, a tool for providing IDE-like features for OCaml), to little touches, like getting people whatever crazy keyboard will help them get their work done most comfortably.<p>Want to see some of our code?

And there has been an alarming rise in the number of seniors who are homeless or relying on food banks.<p>In New York City, the number of seniors is projected to increase to nearly 1.9 million by 2030, making it the fastest-growing population. Unfortunately, seniors struggle disproportionately with access to benefits, health issues, and affordable housing.<p>One out of every six seniors relies on emergency food<p>One out of five lives below the poverty line<p>One out of four has limited mobility<p>Many face these challenges alone. In 2014, 32 percent of persons age 65 and over, and nearly half of persons 85 and older in New York City lived alone.

For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. We pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud R&amp;D</i> is where we build the best cloud platform available: We&#x27;re the majority contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. Our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i> and it&#x27;s <i>still</i> zooming up and to the right.<p>Except for upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial cloud (Pivotal Web Services).<p>Cloud R&amp;D is also responsible for Pivotal Tracker and Spring.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is our suite of battled-hardened products, now open sourced. Greenplum tackles massive datasets with the comfort of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, donated as Apache Geode, is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, excellent benefits and competitive pay.
