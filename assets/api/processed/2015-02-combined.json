The mobile developer has 5+ years of experience with native and hybrid development on both Android and iOS. You will be responsible for successful execution of all of the developer facing Strap SDKs for both mobile and wearable platforms. Day-to-day, you will work closely with the CTO to ensure that your team is on track to meet the goals of the sprint. A high degree of comfort with both Java and Objective-C is required. The expectation is that you are the resident expert in all things mobile related. Experience with one or more wearable platforms (Android Wear, Google Glass, Pebble, Tizen) is strongly preferred. Ideally, you&#x27;ve built and documented API&#x27;s and shipped products that are built for developers.\nAt Strap, we follow a fairly rigorous agile development process. You are expected to communicate your progress “stand-up” style daily while maintaining your work in feature branches with frequent commits. The goal is not to add meaningless processes to your plate; rather, we believe that communication and transparency are two extremely important factors in a successful development team.\nAll developers are expected to also be evangelists for Strap, so you’ll spend 10-15% of your week (NTE 6 hours) being extroverted in some form. Examples include blogging, spending time on Stack Overflow answering questions, or contributing to open source projects. These activities may or may not be directly related to content marketing, but being in the community as a representative of Strap helps our street cred tremendously.\nYou may be asked to travel periodically for conferences, hackathons, or other professional engagements. Travel is not expected to exceed 10% annually.<p>SKILLS\nCommunity Evangelism, Android, iOS Development, Developer Tools, Google Glass, Tizen, SDK, Pebble, Android Wear","time":1422888106,"type":"comment"},{"by":"abfabry","id":8990740,"parent":8980047,"text":"Artsy -- artsy.net, New York -- Full time<p>Artsy&#x27;s mission is to make all the world&#x27;s art accessible to anyone with an internet connection.

But there&#x27;s no platform for them; they typically overload sales-focused CRMs, or are stuck in the world of spreadsheets and email. We&#x27;re changing that. It&#x27;s a fascinating data problem as we&#x27;re mapping out professional and company-to-company networks, trying to understand who does business with whom and why, feeling our way around the underlying graph that nobody&#x27;s explicitly mapped out before. From old school tie to the boardroom, why do people do business with each other? What are the trust and influence networks? What&#x27;s the equivalent of PageRank for investors? What does it mean when a VP moves from one company to another? How do I get my startup funded?<p>We&#x27;re trying to answer all these questions. We have an invite-only product already launched, we&#x27;re building a team-facing solution, and we&#x27;re expanding our data team to work on the platform that powers it all. Here&#x27;s our team&#x27;s take on the space: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jennielees/the-joy-of-data-a1d3757d3567\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@jennielees&#x2F;the-joy-of-data-a1d3757d3567</a> Looking for fast learners who can get their hands dirty, quickly; who know when to duct tape and when to have 100% test coverage (think like a hacker, ship like a pro); who don&#x27;t mind being wrong occasionally; and who are intrigued by the overall space we&#x27;re in. We&#x27;ve had a good run from HN posts so far, hoping to continue it. You&#x27;d be single-digit employee and have a significant chance to influence our culture and growth, as well as immense impact on the product itself. We have a generous equity setup, though we prefer contract-to-hire so we can figure out if we&#x27;d work well together. For our data roles, we prefer Python. Graph-specific data experience is a bonus.<p>Email falon@node.io","time":1422908012,"type":"comment"},{"by":"PureSin","id":8980361,"parent":8980047,"text":"Codecademy | NYC, TN Visa, Product Engineer\nEngineers at Codecademy are full stack (MongoDB&#x2F;Rails, Go, Backbone + React) along with insights on product.

We have hybrid mobile apps for both Android and iOS for our customers AND our drivers. We also have sophisticated web-based tools for our customer service team, internal operations staff, and vendors. Laundry is a surprisingly-complex logistical process, and so our customer-facing software is just the tip of the iceberg. We&#x27;re solving problems like the Traveling Salesman and image classification, too. Our tech stack is approximately HTML5 &#x2F; Backbone.js &#x2F; Django &#x2F; Python &#x2F; Postgres &#x2F; Heroku &#x2F; Ubuntu, but we&#x27;re a tiny tech team, so any newcomer will be able to shape architecture.<p>We&#x27;re also hiring for a &quot;Special Operations Associate&quot; which is someone who may not have unique technical ability, but who has great aptitude and a willingness to work hard to improve our business. Analytical capability and attention to detail are important skills for this person. Bonus points for someone with an Industrial Engineering or Process Engineering background. This position is great for an ambitious analytical mind looking to join a &quot;rocket ship&quot; startup. Obviously, this position presents a significant growth opportunity.<p>Rinse has excellent customer service, and we&#x27;d like to continue improving it with a Customer Service Specialist.  This individual will lead a team of customer service associates, while enjoying close support from our technology and operations teams.  The ideal candidate will have managed customer service in a consumer-focused startup environment.<p>Finally, Rinse is looking for a Business Development Manager to &quot;hustle&quot; and cement new business relationships as we grow.

The Backend Developer has 2+ years of experience developing scalable and secure solutions on the server side using Node.js and MongoDB. Experience with Python and MapReduce is a plus. You’ll be responsible for developing a wide variety of APIs to support all of our web and mobile-based products. Experience with OAuth workflows is strongly desired.  You’ll work closely with our CTO to ensure that your logic and architecture decisions support the wider mission of the Strap family of products.\nAt Strap, we follow a fairly rigorous agile development process. You are expected to communicate your progress “stand-up” style daily while maintaining your work in feature branches with frequent commits. The goal is not to add meaningless processes to your plate; rather, we believe that communication and transparency are two extremely important factors in a successful development team.\nAll employees are expected to also be evangelists for Strap, so you’ll spend 10-15% of your week (NTE 6 hours) being extroverted in some form. Examples include blogging, spending time on Stack Overflow answering questions, or contributing to open source projects. These activities may or may not be directly related to content marketing, but being in the community as a representative of Strap helps our street cred tremendously.\nYou may be asked to travel periodically for conferences, hackathons, or other professional engagements.

New York City. Sunnyvale. Hiring Application Security Consultants\nFull-Time or Internship, work visa sponsorship available.<p>February - The shortest month of the year, and one of the coldest (maybe not so much in our Sunnyvale, CA location).  That month every year when we set aside some time to show appreciation for our loved ones through gifts, greeting cards, dinner dates, flowers, and a well considered application security posture.<p>Maybe that last one isn&#x27;t on everyone&#x27;s minds, but it is here at Matasano Security.  In many environments, while application security is desirable, it generally isn&#x27;t a primary requirement.  Applications need to perform their core purpose, whatever that may be, so they can aid business by driving revenue.  The conflicting priorities can lead developers to make poor design decisions, rush implementations, and spend less time considering attack scenarios than would be ideal.  This isn&#x27;t their fault!  It&#x27;s a function of conflicting priorities and focusing on those which are most tangible, and most measure.<p>At Matasano this balance is different.  Application security is our passion, and our goal is to fill the unmet needs our clients have to strengthen their posture.  Our singular focus on security helps us maintain an aptitude and laser guided precision that&#x27;s far above the mean.  We truly enjoy combing through code, reviewing the flow of information into and out of an application, and finding places where malicious actors can leverage vulnerabilities to their advantage.  We love our clients, but it&#x27;s not the sort of love you&#x27;ll read about on little candy hearts.  We tell them the truth about their security, not just rosy platitudes.<p>Sometimes this can mean delivering bad news when we&#x27;re able to totally compromise an application and execute our own code on its server.  Other times it means explaining that when the server asks the client to identify itself, the client can just lie.  Often it means explaining that their homegrown encryption scheme is no more unintelligible than Pig Latin.  But with this bad news comes some assistance and guidance to help them prioritize improvements and strengthen their products.<p>This sort of work requires a very particular set of skills.  A strong Application Security Consultant needs to deeply understand programming and application design.  They require a foundation in the common application vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, and mitigations.  But more than this they need to be creative and able to maintain multiple perspectives simultaneously to find places where those perspectives are in conflict.  They need to quickly learn and teach themselves, their peers, and their clients.  Above all, they need to be able to communicate well and provide actionable advice to our clients.<p>If you want to see more about the sorts of things we do and love, here&#x27;s some resources;\n Our blog - <a href=\"http://chargen.matasano.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;chargen.matasano.com</a>\n The Matasano Crypto Challenges - <a href=\"http://cryptopals.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptopals.com</a>\n Microcorruption, Embedded Security CTF - <a href=\"http://microcorruption.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;microcorruption.com</a><p>If you think you have what we need, or just want to learn more about us, visit <a href=\"http://matasano.com/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;matasano.com&#x2F;careers</a> or contact us via careers@matasano.com.","time":1422807846,"type":"comment"},{"by":"jtheory","id":8980221,"parent":8980047,"text":"Patients Know Best -- REMOTE ONLY.

Aside from the challenges around scaling, we also just need people working on core features -- more on our stack below.<p>Bonus points for significant experience in healthcare (as an intelligent patient or family member counts!); ditto for experience building things from scratch (i.e., not just implementing specs you&#x27;re given, using the tools the tech lead gave you).<p><i>More about PKB</i><p>I&#x27;ve worked in a lot of different sectors since I first started writing code in the late 90s, including education, b2b supply chains, POS systems, e-commerce, banking, and anti-spam.<p>PKB has been head-and-shoulders above the rest in everything I care about.<p>We&#x27;re building something that actively, <i>directly</i>, improves the lives of people in general -- not selling more stuff, helping others sell more stuff, or making comfortable people a bit more comfortable.  If you&#x27;re interested in PKB&#x27;s growth, funding, profitability, contracts, etc., ask -- our CEO is also active on HN. I&#x27;m the CTO.<p>We&#x27;re solving interesting problems, tech-wise; each person&#x27;s clinical data is encrypted separately, and only the person plus their carers &amp; medical teams granted access can decrypt the private keys (so: I can&#x27;t decrypt your data even for tech support purposes).  On the front end, we need to make sometimes confusing medical data accessible and useful to the patient and their carers, without removing the crucial details that the professionals need to see; across a wide range of browsers and devices (though I&#x27;ll admit, supporting old IE is the kind of problem that&#x27;s hard without being interesting).  We also build apps on our REST API; these are currently based on Steroids&#x2F;PhoneGap (JavaScript at heart).<p>Our core tech stack is solid Java enterprise -- very stable but not bleeding edge; but we&#x27;ll gently dissuade you from writing the AbstractManagerFactory you consider in a moment of weakness.  Secondly, we&#x27;re in the process of tearing apart and rebuilding (I suspect we&#x27;ll permanently be in this process, honestly) -- one major benefit of our architecture becoming increasingly modular will be that we&#x27;ll be able to replace major components with whatever fits the bill.  If you&#x27;re allergic to Java, check back with us next year.<p>Finally, we&#x27;re pragmatic about work&#x2F;life balance.  I work from France, or sometimes from Malaysia, where my in-laws live.  Almost half of the developers have small children at home -- personally, I&#x27;m with my kids in the morning, sometimes at lunchtime, then late-afternoon &amp; evening (while my wife works), and I fill in a bit of extra working time around the edges as needed.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We just went to Portugal...where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that.
