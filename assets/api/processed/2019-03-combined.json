Where most other companies in this space focus on reporting, or task management, we tackle one of the hardest parts, the scheduling itself.<p>Our space lends us to have to solve many interesting problems from optimization, to modern ux flow, to graph theory, to fault tolerant services.

NSIDC is a trusted source of cryospheric data and services, and is a leader in research and development within this field. We enjoy a broad stable funding base which collectively supports our infrastructure and provides growth in numerous technical fields.<p>We are, and have been for the last 25 years, a NASA Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) responsible for archival and stewardship of cryospheric data. We also provide data access tools, documentation, processing services, and cryospheric expertise to the public.<p>This job: This is a new role at NSIDC intended to bridge between our Software Development, Operations, and System Administrations groups. You&#x27;ll be expected to help evolve our infrastructure, including automated software deployment, software&#x2F;system monitoring, and operations. Problems you might tackle include: Evolving a centralized logging&#x2F;visualization infrastructure, positioning the software group for a shift towards processing and data storage in the cloud (a NASA goal), building out a local container orchestration platform, evolving our CI&#x2F;CD infrastucture, and much more. Our software stack is mostly Python, Javascript, and Ruby. We deploy to vSphere VMs using Puppet, and most new software deployments today are done with Docker.<p>Personal pitch: Because we are part of a university, we know private industry can offer you a higher salary. However, we offer a starting benefits package that we feel stands out. The university 401(a) plan contributes 10% of gross pay. 22 vacation days, 15 sick days, and 10 holidays a year. UC Boulder insurance benefits are excellent. UC Boulder offers a significant tuition benefit for faculty (that&#x27;s you), and a smaller benefit for your dependents. Come work here and get your Master&#x27;s&#x2F;PhD! Paychecks come once a month, which may be unusual for some. Top of the bill, for me, is the office environment and people. Our current location is dog-friendly, we have shared offices (usually 2-3 in an office) with openable windows (!), and you&#x27;ll be surrounded with people who care about the work, the overall mission of NSIDC, and learning in general. Our developer group is usually running a book club (currently reading about Elm and just finished &quot;Kanban in Action&quot;), and anyone interested is welcome. You&#x27;ll likely work directly with people who go to Antarctica every year. Finally, Boulder is beautiful. We have so many trails, everyone loves dogs, and we&#x27;re about 2 hours from world-class skiing.<p>Posting: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nsidc.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;devops-administrator\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nsidc.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;devops-administrator</a><p>Application: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.colorado.edu&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;JobDetail&#x2F;?jobId=15411\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.colorado.edu&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;JobDetail&#x2F;?jobId=15411</a>","time":1551463490,"type":"comment"},{"by":"mparrott1","id":19300303,"kids":[19302007],"parent":19281834,"text":"Man AHL | Quant Platform Developer| London, UK | Onsite | Full Time\nAs a Quant Platform Developer at AHL you will be building the tools, frameworks, libraries and applications which power our Quantitative Research and Systematic Trading.

Synthetic Minds will allow you to leverage your technical chops.<p>Synthetic Minds is building program synthesizers, i.e., automation that can write code. We have a system in production that reads&#x2F;writes smart contracts in Ethereum&#x27;s Solidity language, and we use it to ensure our customer&#x27;s code is secure and correct. Eventually, we plan on going far beyond smart contracts. Think of what we are building as a compiler that takes code and translates it to theorem proving, so that we can build automation that can understand code almost as close to a human. If it can understand code, with sufficient compute it can “synthesize” it.<p>In Oct 2018, we raised $5.6M from Y Combinator, Khosla Ventures and Pantera Capital [6]. We have a backlog of customers waiting to be on-boarded. The team is experienced. This is my 2nd YC startup and I have a PhD in Program Synthesis. The 1st employee was the first hire at Parse (YC S11) and spent 10 yrs at Google. We aim to be a 10-15 person all-engineering team in 2019.<p>Roles&#x2F;Openings (see [1]):<p># Software engineer: Systems&#x2F;infrastructure — You’ll be working on distributing heavy CPU processes on AWS. Making sure processes run reliably over many days. Ensure robustness of the infrastructure across node&#x2F;process&#x2F;memory&#x2F;algorithm failures.<p># Software engineer: Compilers&#x2F;verification&#x2F;synthesis — You’ll be working on developing new algorithms that analyze and generate code [2]. You’ll identify when an engineering solution is needed (i.e., throw across a cluster of machines), or when an algorithmic improvement is required. You might even play with the Z3 theorem prover [3]. And if you’re really into it, you can improve Z3.<p># Software engineer: Smart contracts — You’ll be working on the “front-end of the compiler”, which reads in smart contracts languages (e.g., Solidity) and makes it accessible to the backend (the part that does semantic analysis). Desire to work at the compiler level of smart contracts is required, e.g., see [4] — experience in writing smart contracts is easily acquired as a side effect.<p>Contact: saurabhs@synthetic-minds.com - Saurabh, Founder<p>[1] Synthetic Minds Jobs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;synthetic-minds.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;jobs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;synthetic-minds.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;jobs.html</a><p>[2] Program synthesis: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@vidiborskiy&#x2F;software-writes-software-program-synthesis-101-294a9a35177\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@vidiborskiy&#x2F;software-writes-software-pro...</a><p>[3] Z3 Theorem Prover: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Z3Prover&#x2F;z3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Z3Prover&#x2F;z3</a><p>[4] Solidity AST: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ethereum&#x2F;solidity&#x2F;blob&#x2F;develop&#x2F;libsolidity&#x2F;ast&#x2F;AST.cpp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ethereum&#x2F;solidity&#x2F;blob&#x2F;develop&#x2F;libsolidit...</a><p>[5] Solidity smart contracts: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;solidity.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;v0.4.21&#x2F;solidity-by-example.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;solidity.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;v0.4.21&#x2F;solidity-by-examp...</a><p>[6] Forbes funding article: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;darrynpollock&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;22&#x2F;investment-boost-for-synthetic-minds-helps-build-automated-smarter-smart-contracts&#x2F;#6c1994462a63\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;darrynpollock&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;22&#x2F;invest...</a>","time":1551466367,"type":"comment"},{"by":"perrylouniverse","id":19283851,"parent":19281834,"text":"Adacado | Senior Developer | Vancouver, BC, Canada | ONSITE | Full-time<p>You have over 5 years of coding and web application expertise in a senior role, and want to do more innovative development and MUCH less mundane operations support.\n“Creating Change is what we do.”<p>Adacado is looking for expert programmers to enrich our development skill pool and help take our application to the next level, innovatively and technically.
