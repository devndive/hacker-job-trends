Here is the current way it works. A scientist does some experiments and writes up a paper. He sends it to a journal who sends it out to two or three peer reviewers. They peer review it, which means writing a page of comments on it, and recommending either accepting or rejecting it. Usually you get a few journal rejections and the average time-lag between finishing the paper and its being published is 12 months. Then the paper is behind a paywall and people have to pay $35 to read it.<p>Our view of scientific publishing is that when you finish the paper you should post it immediately on the internet. Peer review should be done post-publication, and it should be done by the community, reddit-style, not by just two or three people. We believe peer review will be more robust that way. And the paper should be openly and freely accessible for anyone to read, along with the data and any accompanying materials like source code.<p>We believe that this will speed up science, and accelerate research into curing diseases, reducing infant mortality, and discovering clean energy amongst other things.<p>We are a mission-driven team based in San Francisco. We have raised $17 million from Khosla ventures and Spark Capital. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes &quot;We believe open science is really important.

Lowest livings costs with highest quality of living. Stay in gorgeous, perfectly renovated apartments in pre-WWII residential buildings with high ceilings, right in the middle of the center and pay a fraction of costs of any other capital (even cheaper than any Eastern European capital). No need for a car—Berlin has one of the densest subway nets and wide streets make biking fun. In addition, Germany has an amazing social health care system including health, unemployment and pension (when working as an employee).<p>2. A vibrant and fast growing ecosystem of smart people. A vast number of new software talents, founders, software companies and VCs are moving to Berlin, every day (Twitter, Google, Soundcloud, Early Bird and many more).<p>3. People here are open-minded, outgoing, mix well and international—no need to learn German, everyone speaks English! Making new friends is a matter of days. Visit tons of networking and startup events, every week.<p>4. Easy work permissions—Europeans do not need any and can work from day one and the rest applies for the hassle-free Blue Card.<p>5. Berlin&#x27;s night life is unmatched, huge and changing every day (plus ridiculously cheap). Berlin has got some of the most dazzling, naughty, and original clubs on the face of the Earth.<p>Berlin is calling and getting the new tech hub of Europe.

By becoming a foundational member of our team you will help shape the direction of our product, company and culture.  We’re believe in constantly challenging ourselves to learn new things and would love to teach you what we know and learn from you as well.<p>We want all members of the team to be full-stack engineers and well-rounded individuals.  But, we&#x27;re especially excited about the following profiles:<p>Senior Product Engineer: You&#x27;ve built products from concept all the way to maturity.

Bonus points if you’re on-top of your front-end frameworks like Angular (which we use!), Ember, or Meteor.<p>Senior Systems Engineer: You&#x27;ve architected and scaled backend systems to millions of users.  You&#x27;ve put out every kind of fire and learned a lot in the process. You understand the tradeoffs of different data stores, server architectures, and low-level services.<p>Senior Data Engineer: You&#x27;ve built models which extract insights or predictions from large, living datasets.  You can engage with a dataset in an unfamiliar domain, grasp the dynamics of the system and impress subject area experts with your result.<p>Stupendous Junior Engineer: You don&#x27;t have years of working experience, but you have handful of mind-blowing personal or school projects.

Cutting to the chase:<p>BAGGU (baggu.com) is looking for a well-rounded developer to help us continue to build web-based software tools at our studio in San Francisco.<p>It may seem out of place on HN since we&#x27;re not VC funded, and we make physical products — but technology has been a big part of BAGGU since the beginning. Our website, content management and ordering systems are developed internally. There is a constant dialogue between designers and developers. We build things that suit our needs, and solve problems quickly. Product design, graphic design, photography and interactive all happen in-house. We are a small, close-knit team. It’s a fun and collaborative environment.<p>Our stack is composed of Node.js, Redis and CouchDB on the backend, with Backbone, JQuery and Less (compiled and minified, of course) on the client. Most of our JavaScript is written in CoffeeScript. We use Git and are deployed on Amazon infrastructure. We love building things from scratch, and we’d love to find someone who could lead us toward releasing our tools as open source.<p>Familiarity with components of our stack is important, but most important is that you are disciplined, self-motivated, and fit well into a collaborative creative environment. We’re happy to take on someone technically adept who can learn quickly. You don’t need a CS degree, but you need to both eagerly solve problems that are thrown at you and lead the development of larger projects.<p>To give you a feel for it, these are some examples of things you could be working on:\n- You figure out that ordering system doesn’t seem to be consuming orders via Redis fast enough. Time to get in there and figure out why.\n- It would be convenient if wholesale customers had a portal they could use to process payment. Lay out a roadmap for making this happen, then impliment.\n- View rendering on the client is sometimes too slow. Explore some options for server-sided rendering with some quick mock-ups so we can evaluate a timeframe for making it happen.<p>We are a small business that values a healthy work life balance. There’s plenty to do, but we prefer to get it done at a consistent pace.

We are now looking for a business co-founder and leader to unlock this potential.<p>We’re looking for someone who knows the relevant entertainment markets (including both traditional at-home game consoles and the out-of-home entertainment market); is skilled at business and strategic planning; has experience getting integrated hardware&#x2F;software products to wide distribution; can get us the right industry partners; can lead fundraising as needed; has executive management potential; and is generally a excellent person who is fun and inspiring to work with.<p>Our game table is being featured this month at IndieCade East, the annual independent games festival, at New York’s Museum of the Moving Image. We think it’s both gorgeous and ergonomically unique, comfortably sitting up to 6 players with plenty of leg room. (Design has been led by a cutting-edge architecture firm headed by MIT&#x2F;Harvard architecture professors.) Technically, it’s a smart combination of open-source and proprietary software, including our own game framework built on Unity3D. (The core table engineering was led by an MIT Media Lab expert in multi-touch tables.) Unlike many interactive tables, it’s cool and smooth to the touch and is seamless and spill-proof; having a cocktail or beer at the table is encouraged by design. We already have around a dozen games working on the table -- ranging in stage from alpha to polished, some our own, some from third-parties indie game developers.<p>In short, we think we’ve created a special product that enables a unique and wonderful face-to-face game experience -- bringing the best of digital technology into a fully present, truly social interaction. Now we’re looking for a co-founder to turn an exceptional product into an exceptional business.<p>Additional background: the founder and creative director of Grasshopper NYC is an MIT engineer with a track record of product and business innovation in new media, including high-level executive positions in business news and as as a product management director at Google. A blog post in Gamasutra, a leading games industry website, noted that Grasshopper NYC is being talked about as “the coolest thing happening in the New York game industry at the moment.”<p>Interested?

We forecast at this level as real estate truly is local, and we’ve found there are huge differences in how markets move between zip codes in a county.  Our forecasts have over 90% accuracy forecasting housing prices up to 3 years out for most US real estate markets.  We have back-tested these models for accuracy over the past 40 years, so that we can have confidence in calling the major market turns, and also understand where we are in the cycle and the likely future returns.<p>We are currently working with sophisticated institutions such as homebuilders, land investors, mortgage banks, etc. to use these forecasts.<p>We will be building housecanary.com into a full consumer oriented website in early 2014.  We want to provide property owners in the US with a simple and accurate forecast for what is likely to happen to their home&#x27;s value over the next few years (at a zip code level), given that a home represents most people&#x27;s single largest investment in life. There are many people who want to better understand and plan for future price swings, similar to how they manage the rest of their financial assets, however currently, there is insufficient information available to consumers.  We can now provide 80M US households with powerful data&#x2F;forecasts only the largest banks and hedge funds had access to historically.<p>Positions available:<p>UI&#x2F;UX Designer - Our ideal designer will be able to build beautiful and simple web sites, help out with product design and implement the designs in HTML and CSS.

We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean.
