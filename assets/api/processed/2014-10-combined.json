The team is amazing. There are too many great people here to list, but let me talk about a couple.

Windows driver security and exploit development skills.<p>* The Mountain View line-of-business web software dev we found who picked up a Rails CVE within an hour of looking at Rails for the first time.<p>* The Santa Cruz shorts-and-flip-flops-wearing RTOS spelunker and Microcorruption coauthor; that guy has seen some shit.<p>* The devops from STL who&#x27;d never so much as poked at a web app who implemented an impossibly tricky lattice-reduction+FFT cryptanalytic attack that Nate Lawson showed me as a joke, inside of a week.<p>* The Chicago .NET dev who found us on HN and wound up writing half the crypto challenges<p>I give up. This post would be 5000 words long if I tried to capture just one awesome thing about everyone I work with here. I will miss working with all of them terribly. You could be working with them now. I think you should!<p>As Patrick McKenzie once put it: &quot;If I were looking for a day job, I wouldn&#x27;t be looking for a day job any more: they&#x27;re friendly, happy people who get social license to join the Dark Side, do smart stuff all day, and then go home while it is still light out.&quot;.<p>Matasano tries very, very hard to be cool about hiring.

I returned to school almost twenty years ago and did quite well--but I had taken care of all my math requirements 15 years before that and my degree is about as far from math as one can get. So I had not seen the inside of a math classroom for more than thirty years when I decided not long ago that I wanted to review high school math. Listening to Sal&#x27;s explanations have made this so easy it is as though I had remembered all of it this whole time!<p>I am disabled now, and have no means to continue formal studies in much of anything, but I am now learning the calculus and linear algebra I was planning on studying when I was much younger--before my college career ran off the rails for an extended time. Thank you Sal (and the internets) for letting me remain a student! Keep this place running; I want to be able to hang around here until I am no longer able to hang around anywhere anymore.<p>==================================<p>Every month we get hundreds of letters like this from people in all walks of life who are thankful for our free, high-quality educational content. Most of you reading this are familiar with Sal&#x27;s videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site.<p>A few things we&#x27;re currently working on building right now:<p>– The next version of our personalized learning dashboard [1] to make the UI more consistent across subjects and to help people learn better<p>– Improved knowledge models so we can better know what you know and don&#x27;t know [2]<p>– Infrastructure improvements to make the site more reliable and faster for our millions of visitors every month [3]<p>– Better tools for our content creators to allow them to make thousands of engaging, interactive exercise problems without knowing how to code [4]<p>– A major revision to our iOS app to let students practice skills on the go (or in a classroom with iPads!)<p>You&#x27;ll be part of a small team working alongside both &quot;celebrity&quot; devs (like jQuery creator John Resig and Google&#x27;s first employee Craig Silverstein) and many more who you haven&#x27;t heard of but who are also really awesome.<p>==================================<p>We&#x27;re especially looking for new product designers and mobile devs but we have a handful of other positions open -- take a look and see if anything suits you.<p>Apply at <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.khanacademy.org&#x2F;careers</a> and mention that you&#x27;re coming from HN.

We are a Results-Only Work Environment, have a transparent and public technical ladder, unlimited time off, and require healthy work-life balance. Rails Machine pays 100% of health insurance premiums, participates in 401k match and has been bootstrapped and profitable since our founding in 2006. All employees participate in quarterly profit sharing.<p>As a Site Reliability Engineer at Rails Machine, your goals will be to ensure our customer’s applications are available, fast, and secure. Our customers need the best service, support, and products, and we need you to help us deliver.<p>At Rails Machine, we offer two main products: managed infrastructure and managed operations. Through managed infrastructure, we provide automation, infrastructure, and scalability in our own data center on our own hardware. We provide both bare-metal and virtualized hosting options for our customers, and you’ll work directly with them to ensure their goals are met through automation, analysis, and hardware.<p>Via managed operations, we provide custom, consulting-based solutions on top of AWS and other cloud vendors, as best meets our customer’s needs. You’ll manage globally load balanced AWS installations, cross-datacenter replication on different vendors, or within customer’s data-centers.<p>No matter the product, we take a DevOps-centric approach with our customers - we believe that we provide the best service and our customers get the best value when we work closely together. We integrate task trackers (Pivotal, Trello, Asana), chat (Slack, Hipchat), and source control (github) into our own workflow through careful and clever use of automation, giving our customers the ability to reach out to us like they would with an internal DevOps team but without an operational burden on us.<p>You’ll work with virtualization and container technologies like Xen, OpenStack, Vagrant, Ansible, and Docker. You will setup and automate high availability data clusters (MySQL Galera, PostgreSQL replication, Redis failover, ElasticSearch clustering, Memcached, MongoDB etc.), application instances for technologies like Ruby-on-Rails, Django, Node, and Scala (to name a few), and layer on top of those management, orchestration, monitoring, and alerting for fleets of instances.

There are more than 5,000 rare genetic diseases, in total affecting millions of Americans, and our serious goal is to find treatments for 100 rare diseases in the next 10 years.<p>Our approach is to model rare genetic diseases in human cells, then use these disease models to find drugs that revert the cells to a healthy state, and thus are strong candidates for impacting the disease in patients. In a pretty quick experiment, we image millions of human cells. Image segmentation and analysis quickly makes thousands of measurements, resulting in a very deep quantitation of the state of every single cell. The challenge at hand is running the right experiments in the right way and analyzing results to make the discoveries we seek.<p>I previously co-founded BuildASign.com, a bootstrapped custom printing ecommerce business set to do over $70M in 2014 revenues, and I left daily operations several years back to study biology, bioinformatics, machine learning and drug discovery.

You see the world through the lens of statistics and modeling, you thoroughly understand cross-validation and learning curves, and you can explore data on your own and get an effective guess as to what sort of model and assumptions make sense as a starting point.<p>- You’re motivated both by tackling the most challenging data problems around, and by making lots of patients’ lives dramatically better.<p>- Maybe you already know some biology, but if you don’t, you’re excited to learn what you need to (we’ll help, of course!) in order to really understand our data and approach.<p>- You’ll come to understand our experiments and data at a visceral level and help us guide the direction of our experiments and our company towards our goals.<p>- You’ll work with our biologists to guide our design&#x2F;experiment&#x2F;analyze cycle towards getting the most impactful biological information from the most rapid and cost-effective experimental approaches. This includes researching, suggesting and testing different statistical and machine learning approaches, along with changing our experimental setup to provide more useful information with every round of experiments. You’ll set the groundwork for how we’ll design and analyze thousands of experiments in the coming years.<p>&gt;&gt; Software Engineer (Python):<p>- You have several years of experience in python software development, preferably using ipython and other scientific python tools. You’re also super-comfortable at the command line and handling the standard a linux server, and great at solving any kind of computational issue via stackoverflow. No sysadmins, DBAs or the like will be around to help for a while.<p>- You’re motivated by challenging problems, and by the idea of making millions of patients’ lives dramatically better, as fast as we can.<p>- You’ll work with biologists and data scientists to develop tools to manage and automate our experiments and analyses. To manage the experiments and analyses it will take to treat 100 diseases in 10 years, we’ll need a pretty amazing set of systems in place eventually, but need to get there incrementally so that we can make rapid progress immediately using the resources we have.<p>&gt;&gt; About Recursion:<p>We work in a beautiful office and lab space set directly at the base of the mountains, overlooking Salt Lake City, situated directly one floor above the drug discovery core at the University of Utah, giving us direct access to millions of dollars of cutting edge lab automation and imaging equipment.

And already, we’ve attracted users at many of the top public health and research organizations across the globe.<p><pre><code>  ===============\n  == About You ==\n  ===============\n</code></pre>\nWe’re looking for talented software engineers to help us build towards our vision for a global genomics data network and enable widespread <i>in</i> <i>silico</i> diagnostics. Specifically, we’re interested in folks with a passion for and depth of experience in one or more of the following areas:<p>1) Full Stack Engineering: We will be building everything from developer-facing APIs to easy-to-use end applications for doctors and public health officials. You care about everything from elegant APIs to compelling data visualizations. Python experience preferred (we currently use Flask for our web backend).<p>2) Distributed Systems: We’re building systems for organizing and indexing billions to trillions of genomic fingerprints across the entire tree of life. You’re passionate about data structures, efficient computational solutions, and distributed systems (and don’t mind the occasional bit twiddling). We’ve built some cool initial tech in C, Nimrod, and Python (probabilistic data structures, Docker pipelines for reliably running bioinformatics workflows, etc.), and are excited about the extensive greenfield opportunities here.<p>3) Genomics &#x2F; Computational Biology: We are tackling hard problems at the intersection of microbiology, genomics, statistics, and computer science. You have research experience or another strong connection to these fields, understand current bioinformatics tools and approaches (and their limits), and have worked extensively with next-generation sequencing data. Ideally, you also have some intuitions and strong hypotheses about how bioinformatics tools can scale for petabyte-sized reference sets.<p><pre><code>  ===\n</code></pre>\nYou’ll be one of our first hires and directly shape our technology choices, product, and business.

But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun.

We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else.
