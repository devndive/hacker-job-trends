The news all too often brings word of yet another compromise, exposing financial information, personal details, or simply salacious pictures.  Whatever the impact, it&#x27;s clear the technology industry has a problem, and there are few easy solutions.<p>Some seek legislation to impose harsher penalties on the responsible parties.  This ignores the fact that many of those responsible are outside the jurisdictions which seek to punish them.  In some cases, they may have tacit approval of their own government, or even be operating on their government&#x27;s behalf.  Others turn to established security products looking for antivirus and network filtering technologies to add protection.  This is an also an imperfect solution.  It places the defender in a reactive posture, responding only to those threats which have been previously detected, and for which countermeasures have been developed.  There&#x27;s no perfect solutions.<p>At Matasano, we believe the best way to combat security weaknesses is at their source; by discovering and remediating software vulnerabilities before others leverage them for ill effect.  Our clients see the value in this approach.  We&#x27;re engaged to work on some of the most interesting and important software on the planet.  Aside from identifying vulnerabilities, we help our clients identify the root cause.  Through this, they can adjust processes to reduce the likelihood of similar problems in the future, while increasing their ability to identify and correct them.  The goal is more resilient software.<p>We&#x27;ve assessed hot startup web applications, low level device firmware, mobile platforms, and everything in between.  With this breadth, we have need for employees skilled in frameworks like Node, Rails, Django, and Spring.  We need people comfortable with x86 and ARM assembly, reverse engineering, and binary protocol analysis.  If you&#x27;re skilled in a programming language with the letter &#x27;C&#x27; in it, that&#x27;s desirable.  Newer safer languages like Rust and Golang are in demand.  In short if you share our focus on helping secure our software ecosystem one piece at a time and want a chance to do something about it, we should talk.<p>Learn about our hiring process at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.matasano.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.matasano.com&#x2F;careers</a> or contact us at careers@matasano.com\nGet a taste for some of what we do at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microcorruption.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microcorruption.com</a> and <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cryptopals.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cryptopals.com</a>\nCheck out our blog at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;chargen.matasano.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;chargen.matasano.com</a><p>Next month, you&#x27;ll notice a change in these posts.

We believe that what we&#x27;re working on is the biggest financial and social impact opportunity in the world today. Enlitic uses recent advances in machine learning to make medical diagnostics faster, more accurate, and more accessible. Founded by Kaggle&#x27;s past president and chief scientist, its mission is to provide the tools that allow physicians to fully utilize the vast stores of medical data collected today, regardless of what form they are in - such as medical images, doctors&#x27; notes, and structured lab tests. To realize this vision, we are building on state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and partnering with top research hospitals and medical device manufacturers. We&#x27;ve raised $5m funding and have a small team of 10 applied machine learning experts.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in playing with cool hardware and data, we&#x27;re a great place to come. We use a cluster of hundreds of Tesla K80 GPUs, and have many millions of medical images - some single images are over 10GB in size. Many are 3d, which makes for some really interesting engineering challenges.<p>We use a wide range of tools and languages, including Python (Theano, Pandas&#x2F;Numpy&#x2F;etc, Flask), Meteor, CoffeeScript, and C++ (Caffe). We have regular journal club talks (mainly recent deep learning papers), and a good mix of research and applied work. Our day to day work covers a lot of cancer detection and treatment planning, as well as a wide range of other high impact medical issues - the consistent underlying theme is using a data-driven approach to improving patient outcomes. There are particularly big opportunities (both financial and social impact) in the developing world.\nWe&#x27;re working with many of the top academics in the medical diagnostics field, and are partnering with some of the top hospitals around the country and around the world. We are looking for people that have an in depth understanding of linear algebra, convex optimization, algorithm design, and software engineering, to join us as data scientists, full stack and frontend engineers, and dev ops engineers. No medical or life sciences background is necessary. Python, C++, and CUDA experience is helpful - but the proven ability to learn quickly is more important. We&#x27;re also looking for MD&#x2F;PhDs with physics or comp sci backgrounds to help us brings the worlds of medicine and machine learning together. In addition, we’re looking for a senior business development person.<p>Have a look at our team to see whether you think you might be a good fit <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enlitic.com&#x2F;team.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enlitic.com&#x2F;team.html</a> .

We&#x27;re mostly a Java enterprise stack, actively rebuilding and splitting up functions, actually. Recently we&#x27;ve scripted the setup of the entire stack (or individual servers), including using Vagrant to easily set up a complete environment locally for each developer.<p><i>More about PKB</i><p>I&#x27;ve worked in a lot of different sectors since I first started writing code in the late 90s, including education, b2b supply chains, POS systems, e-commerce, banking, and anti-spam.<p>PKB has been head-and-shoulders above the rest in everything I care about.<p>We&#x27;re building something that actively, directly, improves the lives of people in general -- not selling more stuff, helping others sell more stuff, or making comfortable people a bit more comfortable.

We aspire to create significant societal impact and are motivated by the idea that our products will change the lives of people we love.\nFundamentally, we are focused on developing new types of sensors and pairing them with deep learning to get a window into biology and medicine that nobody has ever had before. We have audacious plans – but we have an unbeatable team and a founder that has disrupted biomedical science successfully more than once.\nIf you have experience in image reconstruction, mixed-signal IC design, high-speed electronics, nanophotonics, microfabrication, MEMs, biophysics, biochemistry, molecular biology, deep learning, cloud computing, embedded systems, or hold any dual degree with distinction along with computer science please contact us and “put a dent in the universe”.\nWhy Us?\nWe envision, incorporate, finance, support, and mentor a select number of startups that we are committed to make successful. Each startup is funded from the beginning for success, allowing the team to exploit new developments in physics, math, and the life sciences to create truly novel technologies and do the science enabled by being first.\nOur Startups have decoded the Neanderthal Genome, enabled what the New England Journal calls the new age of molecular medicine, helped crack the disappearance of the honey bee, sequenced the first personal genome, developed promising new drugs for breast cancer, been named three times as World Economic Forum Technology pioneers, and twice as Science Magazines top innovations of the year.\nThe startups have dedicated space and we work intimately with them to support them strategically, administratively, legally, commercially, with regulatory agencies, as well as offer them core design, engineering, software platforms, and a supplier and manufacturing network to accelerate their programs.","time":1430495344,"type":"comment"},{"dead":true,"deleted":true,"id":9472221,"parent":9471287,"time":1430495306,"type":"comment"},{"by":"mightypirate","id":9471506,"kids":[9471626],"parent":9471287,"text":"REMOTE data scientist\napply at ianalysedataandshit@pronto.uk","time":1430490443,"type":"comment"},{"by":"stanleyysuen","id":9473000,"parent":9471287,"text":"s","time":1430500663,"type":"comment"},{"by":"jmett","id":9473584,"kids":[9475671],"parent":9471287,"text":"Disappointed to see Meteor appearing only twice (3 times now :)) on ctrl+f.","time":1430505429,"type":"comment"}]}
