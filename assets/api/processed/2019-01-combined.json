Those new projects are going very well - we have over 26K founders signed up for Startup School - and we want to double down on them.<p>An unusual aspect of being on the YC software team is that you&#x27;ll get full access to the YC program, founders and partners - from our dinner talks to demo day.  You&#x27;ll learn the ins and outs of how YC works, and you&#x27;ll get to know and learn from hundreds of companies.  If you want to start a startup someday, working at YC would be an excellent jumping off point.<p>We&#x27;re looking for capable generalist engineers. We care mostly about your ability to write great software; we don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;ve used the technologies we work with as long as you&#x27;re willing to learn them.

Most of the team works from our office in South Africa. However, 8 months ago I moved to Singapore for work &#x2F; personal reasons. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone will now be remote from my perspective, I decided it&#x27;s a good time to start focusing on hiring for remote work. We’ve hired 3 remote developers so far and it’s been a great experience!<p>SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses.<p>Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn&#x27;t mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don&#x27;t offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset. The work will include: Doing direct integrations with banks that offer good APIs; Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us; Adding new features; Optimising for performance; Integrating with government systems; Squashing bugs; Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (maybe using Flutter).<p>Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or polyglots who at least know Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they&#x27;ve learnt.<p>Location: Most of the team is in GMT+2, and I&#x27;ll be in GMT+8 going forward. So anything from GMT+2 to GMT+8 should be OK.<p>Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za and put &quot;Hacker News&quot; somewhere in the subject.

Our team is also building out the homepage for the cloud and starting out some new dashboards. Another branch of our team builds out all of the SDK&#x27;s.

In truth, we are pioneering a new model of corporate culture, and learning as we go.<p>For example, as Angelina Kwan, chief operating officer of BitMEX, put it: “In addition to being a true market leader among trading platforms, BitMEX shares my values of gender inclusion, particularly in STEM fields. Cryptocurrency markets present an exciting new opportunity for women to get involved in the intersection of finance and technology.”<p>All BitMEX employees have at least three things in common: they buy into our core values unequivocally, they are effective in their roles, and they own up to their actions.

That means doing whatever it takes to bring them into our developer community and keep them actively and happily building within it while learning from their experiences.<p>Practically speaking, this means that you will wear a lot of hats.  As the core protocol is developed, you will be a key interface with the early adopter community to make sure they will have a great experience on the platform when it is released.  You’ll need to build developer tools, write demos&#x2F;tutorials and otherwise do pretty much whatever it takes to ensure developers have a great experience onboarding to and using the platform.<p>Going forward, you will be a visible presence representing NEAR in communities around the world by working directly with our events and community teams.  This means everything from speaking to hosting workshops to supporting developers at events. You are the voice of the community to our internal team as well, helping to inform the development and education roadmaps.<p>This is a role that will allow you to build real software and also take a public-facing role representing the platform to developer communities.  It is one part engineering, one part community and one part education with a sprinkle of marketing and PR.

I am also hiring interns year-round (interns are typically at the late-stage undergrad or graduate level).<p>A quick brief about the institute more generally: MPI-SWS is a world-class academic research institution located in the German cities of Saarbrücken and Kaiserslautern.  Our faculty are world leaders in many research areas including cloud &amp; distributed systems, computer networks, operating systems, security, privacy, programming languages, verification, and more.  All students admitted to our PhD program receive full funding for the duration of their PhD.  Structurally, our PhD program is similar to those found at US research universities, with longer-duration PhDs, flexibility to move between research groups, and a multicultural, English-language working environment.<p>More specifically about my research group: My group&#x27;s goal is to make it easier to operate large software systems and to understand their behavior at runtime.  Our research entails designing new abstractions for building distributed systems, new techniques for measuring and understanding their performance, and new tools for analyzing their behavior both online and offline.  The kind of questions we ask include things like:<p>* When you put together a complex distributed system, how do you know what it&#x27;s doing when you run it?<p>* Is my distributed system performing well? Did I configure it correctly?<p>* When things go wrong -- like a crash, or if things are really slow -- how do I figure out why?<p>* If I&#x27;m building a new system, what choices can I make so that it&#x27;s easier to understand and analyze its behavior later?<p>* How can multiple users effectively and efficiently share a distributed system without impacting each other?<p>The type of systems we work with include those offered by public cloud providers (Google Cloud, AWS), open-source systems like those in the Hadoop ecosystem, and emerging paradigms like microservice architectures and function-as-a-service platforms.  My group&#x27;s research has a significant practical element, and applicants will need to be comfortable diving into unfamiliar code bases and rapidly prototyping new ideas.<p>If this sounds interesting to you, please feel free to get in touch with me directly (mention seeing this ad for bonus points).

I&#x27;m James Nichols, an engineering manager at Plaid. We&#x27;re hiring, and I believe that for the right people, a position at Plaid could be truly transformational. I was a member of Microsoft&#x27;s Bing team back when it was MSN Search (2006!) and was at Airbnb before it was a household name, but I&#x27;ve never been more excited than I am now in my new role at Plaid. I joined Plaid because of the Plaids I met and because of the feeling I had that I had discovered a secret: a really amazing company, well-positioned in an exciting space, that wasn&#x27;t well known among my friends.<p>Interestingly, only my friends in fintech had familiarity. &quot;Plaid? Oh they&#x27;re great!&quot; was a common refrain. As I learned more, I realized that Plaid was actually a major part of some of my favorite apps (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;04&#x2F;meet-the-startup-that-powers-venmo-robinhood-and-other-big-apps.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;04&#x2F;meet-the-startup-that-powers...</a>). Venmo, Robinhood, Lending Club, Coinbase, Acorns, and Plastic all use Plaid&#x27;s APIs to improve the user experience of connecting to the banking system. 2018 has been a big year for Plaid (and the fintech space in general), and the company has huge plans in 2019 to deliver even more consumer value, to expand dramatically, and to do it all while cultivating a company culture (and hiring bar) to be proud of.<p>The vast majority of the company is based in San Francisco, but the newly opened Salt Lake City office has a small, tight team that’s growing fast, led by Kira Booth (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;kira-booth-11aab289&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;kira-booth-11aab289&#x2F;</a>). The SLC office (in the growing tech scene of “Silicon Slopes”) is a short drive from world-class skiing and national parks.  Plaid also has a team of distributed, location-independent, highly successful engineers. The company is doubling down on this, as evidenced by hiring me as their first remote engineering manager. I&#x27;ll be remote myself, and focused on building a world-class work environment for remote engineers who want to be part of a hypergrowth Silicon Valley company but also want to have flexibility in where they work.<p>Does any of this sound good?

As we grow, the expectation is that you will too. All doors are open, from diving deeper into a technical speciality, to moving sideways into another area, to mentorship and leadership roles - in the end, it&#x27;s down to you, your goals and your performance.<p>If you want to be a part of a big, ambitious story, let&#x27;s chat!","time":1546447718,"type":"comment"},{"by":"annahall","dead":true,"id":18906674,"parent":18807017,"text":"Created in 2014, Socotra is focused on building the most modern cloud-based platform for technology-driven insurers.

We have a hundred thousand active customers across the globe, particularly in Asia.<p>Developed by ex-bankers well-versed in computer science, financial engineering, and traditional finance, BitMEX launched in 2014. We’re new (but so is everybody in this industry) and we’ve been humbled by our success so far.<p>Our innovative, secure, and very liquid platform currently trades between $2 and $5 billion USD a day of crypto derivatives (futures and options only; we are not a spot exchange where you can buy Bitcoin with USD or other fiat currencies).<p>By offering the crypto-sphere’s greatest price discovery marketplace, BitMEX also expects, over the long term, to spur Bitcoin adoption by consumers and merchants.<p>Culturally, BitMEX defies the stereotypes of both the old-fashioned, testosterone-drenched Wall Street “boys club” type of firm, as well as the politically correct, “snowflake-coddling” Silicon Valley tech outfit. In truth, we are pioneering a new model of corporate culture, and learning as we go.<p>For example, as Angelina Kwan, chief operating officer of BitMEX, put it: “In addition to being a true market leader among trading platforms, BitMEX shares my values of gender inclusion, particularly in STEM fields. Cryptocurrency markets present an exciting new opportunity for women to get involved in the intersection of finance and technology.”<p>All BitMEX employees have at least three things in common: they buy into our core values unequivocally, they are effective in their roles, and they own up to their actions. No workplace is free of internal politics, but we are as much of a meritocracy as you’ll find in this cruel world. And you can be almost anything you want to be at BitMEX as long as you make your mark with your work.<p>If you like what you&#x27;ve read, visit bitmex.com&#x2F;careers or email people@bitmex.com.
