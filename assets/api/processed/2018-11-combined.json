Messages are personalized in different ways.<p>We are hooking commerce functionality into the conversations as well. Buying products this way is a lot of fun as a user. Thanks to our design, we can kick off any kind of API calls as a natural part of the conversation without adding complexity to the codebase.<p>Our current tooling is a mix of Python, Node, PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, and Docker. We are exploring Go for some things and prefer smaller abstractions, less frameworks, minimal dependencies, and leveraging purpose-built components. We value orthogonality and safety as design principles. Creativity is best applied to data structures and decoupling.<p>We are strongly motivated by inclusiveness of all genders, faiths, origins and backgrounds and are careful about ensuring a harmonious and respectful team culture with space for every voice and safety in mutual vulnerability.

The field of automated parsing has been bogged down for the last 20 years because of its dependence on labelled training data (e.g the Penn Treebank).

I&#x27;m James Nichols, an engineering manager at Plaid. We&#x27;re hiring, and I believe that for the right people, a position at Plaid could be truly transformational. I was a member of Microsoft&#x27;s Bing team back when it was MSN Search (2006!) and was at Airbnb before it was a household name, but I&#x27;ve never been more excited than I am now in my new role at Plaid. I joined Plaid because of the Plaids I met and because of the feeling I had that I had discovered a secret: a really amazing company, well-positioned in an exciting space, that wasn&#x27;t well known among my friends.<p>Interestingly, only my friends in fintech had familiarity. &quot;Plaid? Oh they&#x27;re great!&quot; was a common refrain. As I learned more, I realized that Plaid was actually a major part of some of my favorite apps (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;04&#x2F;meet-the-startup-that-powers-venmo-robinhood-and-other-big-apps.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;04&#x2F;meet-the-startup-that-powers...</a>). Venmo, Robinhood, Lending Club, Coinbase, Square Cash, Acorns, and Plastic all use Plaid&#x27;s APIs to improve the user experience of connecting to the banking system. 2018 has been a big year for Plaid (and the fintech space in general), and the company has huge plans in 2019 to deliver even more consumer value, to expand dramatically, and to do it all while cultivating a company culture (and hiring bar) to be proud of.<p>The vast majority of the company is based in San Francisco, but the newly opened Salt Lake City office has a small, tight team that’s growing fast, led by Kira Booth (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;kira-booth-11aab289&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;kira-booth-11aab289&#x2F;</a>). The SLC office (in the growing tech scene of “Silicon Slopes”) is a short drive from world-class skiing and national parks.  Plaid also has a team of remote, location-independent, highly successful engineers. The company is doubling down on this, as evidenced by hiring me as their first remote engineering manager. I&#x27;ll be remote myself, and focused on building a world-class work environment for remote engineers who want to be part of a hypergrowth Silicon Valley company but work from anywhere they want.<p>Does any of this sound good? Learn more at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plaid.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plaid.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;</a> and reach out to me by email (my first name at plaid.com) with a little bit about yourself. Let me know which one of these statements resonates the most:<p>- You&#x27;re excited about the fintech space but would prefer to empower hundreds of consumer applications rather than just a single one.\n- You want to join a hypergrowth company, especially before everyone else finds out about it.\n- You care a lot about company culture and the people you work with, but impact is your primary motivation to do great work.\n- You’re based in Salt Lake City and excited at the prospect of a growing SLC office of a Silicon Valley company.\n- You&#x27;ve considered becoming a remote engineer, but are worried that you&#x27;ll have to sacrifice career growth, technical challenge, culture, or other important parts of your work environment.\n- You&#x27;re already a very effective remote engineer and interested in collaborating with a team invested in remote work.","time":1541087207,"type":"comment"},{"by":"tomasz207","id":18357423,"parent":18354503,"text":"Panasonic | Product Manager, Integrated Pan&#x2F;Tilt&#x2F;Zoom Camera Systems | Newark, NJ | ONSITE | <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;us-careers.panasonic.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;product-manager-work-from-home-pna-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;us-careers.panasonic.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;product-manage...</a><p>Help develop the next generation of remote PTZ cameras for professional video production, streaming and live broadcast.","time":1541099799,"type":"comment"},{"by":"flrecruiting","id":18385906,"parent":18354503,"text":"Faithlife | Senior Full Stack Software Developer-Social Network | Bellingham, WA or Chandler, AZ | Full-time | Onsite\nFaithlife is a tech company committed to the Church.

Led by veteran founders, Knotel creates custom headquarters for companies without any of the headaches. Whether for 20 or 500 people, for 6 months or 6 years, Knotel provides businesses the flexibility and design they need in office space so they can focus on their work.<p>Most companies no longer maintain their own server hardware because AWS offers more flexibility and obviates the need to have hardware on-site and IT folks managing and maintaining uptime. At Knotel we think we can provide something similar for office space -- allowing companies to have the ability to scale up and down like cloud servers and freeing them from the responsibility of managing space by having to find people to take over their long leases, do space build outs, hiring their own with facilities management, etc.<p>As a result, we have a ton of interesting tech challenges all up and down the stack. We are working on a canonical data model for storing all of the information on spaces so we can increase operational efficiency and transparency across the company. We are building internal tools to increase our efficiency as a company. We are rolling out a data pipeline and ensuring all data flows into our data warehouse so everyone across the company can report on their key metrics. We are integrating with hardware in the physical space to track information like usage, temperature, and we are figuring out solutions for smart access control.
