The ideal candidate is a software engineer with strong written and verbal English skills with at least a few years of professional experience. Interviewing experience would be great, but we spend 25 hours (paid) training you before you even start, so if you&#x27;re strong technically and love working with people we can usually make it work :) Interviews are conducted over video chat, using a collaborative code editor.<p>Some of our interviewers are freelancers who use our scheduling model to backfill hours; others are full timers at top tech companies looking to make some extra cash; others have quit their jobs to work with us full time; some are digital nomads; one of our interviewers is road tripping around North America for a year and a half, doing anywhere from zero to 40 interviews each week depending on where he is and what the weather&#x27;s like.<p>The application form is here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced64c86?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source=HNWH\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced6...</a><p>I know it&#x27;s a pretty unique job, so if you have any questions reply here or email me at josh@karat.io and I&#x27;m happy to talk through any of it.<p>P.S.

We mean it.<p>We value aptitude over alma mater, empathy over a list of APIs. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether your resumé says PHP or PhD: if you&#x27;re smart, empathetic and know some stuff, we want to work with you.<p>We have many offices worldwide including SF, NYC, Toronto, London, Palo Alto (pivotal.io&#x2F;locations) and more coming. We&#x27;re broken into two main divisions: Pivotal Labs (<i>that</i> Pivotal Labs) and R&amp;D.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i> helps clients to become better at product development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. We pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels. The goal is to teach the teachers. Our engineers pair with client engineers, often we pair designers and product managers as well.<p>Not many people get to transform how people think and work. Why not you?<p>-- <i>R&amp;D</i> is a big tent these days, encompassing two major cloud platforms (Pivotal Application Service &amp; Pivotal Container Service), Pivotal Tracker, Spring Framework, Greenplum, Apache HAWQ (incubating), Gemfire &#x2F; Apache Geode, BOSH and Concourse CI. We&#x27;re adding Pivotal Function Service this year. We dogfood the cutting edge of our technology on our own commercial cloud, Pivotal Web Services, run by our awesome CloudOps team. We&#x27;re the majority contributors to the Cloud Foundry project and we&#x27;re a platinum CNCF member with rapidly-growing contributions to the k8s ecosystem. There is a lot happening right now and there are greenfield platform opportunities.<p>Not many people get to work on or work with such systems. Why not you?<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, excellent benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong isn&#x27;t mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The NYC beer fridge has more IPAs than I prefer but I guess that&#x27;s life in paradise.<p>-- <i>Applying</i><p>To see open jobs, go to pivotal.io&#x2F;careers.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do “expense reports that don’t suck!” (Google “expensify” to read more.) We’re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren’s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it’s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won’t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn’t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We’ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and Uruguay. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We’re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you’re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you’re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you’re this sort of person, you’ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn’t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That’s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it’s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I’m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don’t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com.

Automate, delegate, batch. \n  - Lets data decide instead of exclusively relying on hunches.\n  - Is passionate about a long-term future in growth marketing (aka growing startups).\n  - Is able to quickly connect dots and come up with creative strategies on the spot.\n</code></pre>\nWe operate unlike a typical agency. (I wish there were a better term than &quot;agency.&quot;) We work with clients for a long time; we see them from start to finish. You&#x27;ll get a front-row seat to some of the most interesting companies. We have a profound impact on our clients&#x27; businesses and product roadmaps. They listen to us. Because we have built a moat of data and tactics that others have not figured out. (I personally learned a lot from previously running growth for Heap and Webflow.)<p>I have a hunch that A) operations&#x2F;product leads, B) sociable engineers, and C) salespeople looking for something more than sales calls will be a great fit for this role.<p>How to apply:<p><pre><code>  - → Email me (Julian Shapiro): jobs [at] bellcurve.com\n  - → Kindly link me to your LinkedIn or attach a resume :)\n  - Please note you must have experience working at a funded startup.\n  - You must live in the US or Canada.\n  - If you&#x27;re a fit, I will respond same-day and we&#x27;ll hop on a call together.\n</code></pre>\nI will look at every application very closely.<p>---<p>More about me (Julian):<p><pre><code>  - My growth interview on IndieHackers: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiehackers.com&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;017-julian-shapiro-of-bell-curve\n  - I wrote the most popular guide on growth: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;julian.com&#x2F;learn&#x2F;growth\n  - I built Velocity.js — one of the biggest open source projects\n  - Catch me here: twitter.com&#x2F;shapiro\n  - My LinkedIn: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;juliandeanshapiro\n\n                               (\n                      .-&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;-..&#x27; \\                      _____           _____\n            _______ .&#x27;       -   \\                 ,ad8PPPP88b,     ,d88PPPP8ba,\n          &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; );__   ,,,_)   \\               d8P&quot;      &quot;Y8b, ,d8P&quot;      &quot;Y8b\n             &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ) ;C  &#x2F;     \\             dP&#x27;           &quot;8a8&quot;           `Yd\n               &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; (.-&#x27;-.  )====_)_=======&gt;   8(              &quot;              )8\n                 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \\    &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;   )          I8                             8I\n                 ;  &lt;&lt;&lt;     .......__&#x2F;            Yb,                         ,dP\n            .-&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;         (         )              &quot;8a,                     ,a8&quot;\n         .-&#x27;              ;.       &#x2F;                 &quot;8a,                 ,a8&quot;\n        &#x2F;  .-&#x27;     .     =  .     &#x2F;                    &quot;Yba             adP&quot;\n    _-&#x27;&#x27;\\_&#x2F;         &#x27;. .&#x27;    .   &#x2F;                       `Y8a         a8P&#x27;\n .-&#x27;  )  ;\\          &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;.     . &#x2F;                          `88,     ,88&#x27;</code></pre>","time":1517516518,"type":"comment"},{"by":"dduben","id":16285718,"kids":[16288948],"parent":16282819,"text":"I am looking for a Biomedical Engineering position in Florida, full time and onsite.
