That includes some of the biggest open-source and proprietary software stacks in the world.<p>This is the <i>Mission: Impossible</i> of software gigs, and we need the best people to get the job done. NO PRIOR APPSEC EXPERIENCE REQUIRED. We need great software developers and fast learners, for we intend to go in harm's way.

In addition, Germany has an amazing social health care system including health, unemployment and pension (when working as an employee).<p>2. A vibrant and fast growing ecosystem of smart people. A vast number of new software talents, founders, software companies and VCs are moving to Berlin, every day (Twitter, Google, Soundcloud, Early Bird, Mozilla and many more).<p>3. People here are open-minded, outgoing, mix well and international—no need to learn German, everyone speaks English! Making new friends is a matter of days. Visit tons of networking and startup events, every week.<p>4. Easy work permissions—Europeans do not need any and can work from day one.<p>5.

You could call this an intern type position, but I don't care if you are in school or not.<p>Prgmr.com rents virtual private servers, dedicated servers, and datacenter space.  Right now, we have 3 full-time folks, counting me, and two part-timers but I'm the only hardware person, and only two of us are local.<p>So, there are several catches.  the first?  I can't afford a full time person for at least two months.   If you are willing to show up and work between then and now?  $15/hr on a 1099.  After those two months (and after I'm done paying for twice the co-lo I need)  we can talk about going full time W2.  (prgmr.com pays for Kaiser, if you are full-time)<p>Now, I do have an arrangement with a local refurbished server and network hardware dealer;  I give him a good entry level person, he'll hire them full time with health insurance and stuff (for a little more than I'm paying;  not a lot more, this is definitely still entry-level pay.)  and he'll rent you back to me on a per-day basis at a discount (sort of as a referral bonus to me.)   - so that's one way you can make this full-time before I stabilize prgmr.com.   Note, he's based out of mountain view, and I'm in Santa Clara and all of this is very much hands-on work.<p>So yeah, what I need is someone I can teach how to handle my layer-1.   I need my shit wired up, I need it wired up neatly (I can train you in cable lacing, but the neater you are, the better.)   I need all my ports labeled inside my network gear (I can show you how to do this; Serial ain't rocket science.)  and inside my PDUs.<p>This would be pretty good for someone studying up on their CCNA or something;  I probably have obsolete hardware I could give you for your lab, too.<p>I need someone I can train up to set up my IPMI out of band access.  Again, I can train, it's not hard.    Again, experience using the command line helps a lot.<p>I also need someone who can handle racking/stacking servers, dragging servers to the car and back.  You need to be able to safely lift 50lbs, (and more importantly, you need to ask for help when you /can't/ lift safely.  pester the security guys;  they will usually help, and if not, call me.)  and you need transportation that can handle 50lb servers.  (meh, if you have transportation, we can probably work something out with the hauling.  I've got an old van I loan people.)<p>You need to be able to handle ssh, and ssh with public key authentication with minimal help from me.<p>So, the way I usually do this is that people email me, we go back and forth a few times (I won't hire you if you can't communicate via email... sorry, just one of my things.)  then next time I need help I call you up.   You show up and work.  I pay you (check, but if you want we can drop by the bank and get it cashed for you same day... just when I pay cash the accountant gets mad at me)   If you do well and I need help again, i call you back;   At these rates, (and especially with this (lack of) stability) it's not fair to expect you to interview for free.<p>So yeah.  Entry level.    If you seem teachable, I don't care if you are currently unemployed.<p>I demand honesty, but not loyalty;  by that, I mean I'm realistic.

To reduce downtime, companies depend on a global supply chain of warehouses, delivery services, and manufacturers to supply the service parts to maintain the infrastructure of the modern world. Baxter Planning Systems is seeking outstanding Java Developers to optimize and automate every facet of this service parts supply chain.<p>Baxter Planning Systems offers a unique environment combining the flexibility of a startup with the stability of an established company. Our developers are involved in the entire product lifecycle, from problem description to design and execution. 20 years of established business with numerous satisfied customers provides ongoing revenue that isolates us from the anxiety of funding cycles or the constant search for the next big deal.<p>Working closely with on-staff domain experts, our developers have the opportunity to learn about the complexities of global supply chain management, and offer their own solutions to the challenges it presents. Challenges like planning optimal stocking levels for tens of thousands of parts distributed across thousands of locations worldwide, combined with complex interdependencies due to substitutability, regulatory issues, and the need to minimize both downtime and cost.<p>The ideal candidate for Baxter is a smart developer who gets things done by applying technology, especially open source, to meet our goals while maintaining a healthy work-life balance. The development and QA teams work closely with key stakeholders to formulate and manage development timelines that are both realistic and produce high-quality application features. You won't have to start from scratch either: we have a great infrastructure of automated unit/integration/regression/UI tests, automated builds, virtualized test environments, and a solid technology stack. But we recognize there's always room for improvement and welcome the experience and expertise you'd bring in improving our development practices, tools, and execution.<p>Regretfully at this time we are unable to accommodate 3rd party placement agencies, H-1B sponsorships,  long-term telecommuting, or relocation.

Under the hood, this translates to building a platform that can talk to and move data between virtually any API you can think of, all in realtime and at massive scale.<p>We’re hoping to find candidates who speak fluently about distributed architectures, databases, and ops, who enjoy rolling up their sleeves and writing code at all levels of the stack, and who have the confidence and depth of knowledge to take ownership of long-term projects. IFTTT currently runs on a polyglot mix of technologies, including EC2, Rails, Node.js, MySQL, Redis, Memcached, and Chef. Experience with these is a big plus, but we’re constantly evolving, and we value creative problem-solving and desire to learn over domain knowledge.<p>We recently secured a new round of funding, and we work hard to do right by our employees. New hires at IFTTT enjoy competitive salary and equity, full benefits, sane work schedules, and a flexible vacation policy. Much more than that, we offer interesting, deep projects and an amazing team experience. We operate on the philosophy that the best job perk is fantastic teammates, and to this end we’ve assembled a staff of intensely curious, well-rounded, talented people who happen to be great engineers. We’re hoping you can be the next one.","time":1367421728,"type":"comment"},{"by":"bretthellman","id":5640886,"parent":5637663,"text":"Hall.com\nLocation: Mountain View CA<p>Hall is the next big enterprise communications company.

We’re in search of back-end developers with a passion for solving hard problems with performant code. If you are interested in creating great products, building new features and improving the existing Shopify features, then please apply!<p>Developing Shopify<p>Shopify is the longest continuously developed Rails app on the planet and we care a great deal about code quality. Shopify, in contrast to most other rails shops, always runs on the latest rails version. Many core rails features have been developed within Shopify and have later been added to the Rails framework. We often go back and improve core parts of the Shopify codebase to make it better or more lean. We can do this because we have a positively massive unit test coverage which will immediately sound the alarm when something goes wrong.<p>We ship on quality instead of on time. When a feature is ready we deploy it immediately to everyone or use an internal system to roll it out to a certain percentage of customers. Various teams deploy new code many times throughout the day.<p>Shopify's production scale is massive. We host tens of thousands of online stores and regularly see hundreds of millions of requests a day. When you push out new code tons of people will see what you made within seconds. Operating on this level is hard but incredibly rewarding.<p>Responsibilities:<p>* Write back-end code in Ruby and Go.<p>* Work with a world class design and product team.<p>* Providing beautiful and fast code that improves the code-base of our products in meaningful ways.<p>* Use TDD to write rock-solid code, utilizing our huge test suite to make changes with confidence.<p>* Rapidly fix bugs or take your time to solve hard problems well.<p>* Deploy code to hundreds of servers and tens of thousands of customers in your first week.<p>* Never stop learning. Shopify is an environment of constant personal growth.<p>Qualifications and Desired Skills:<p>* Know Rails or be ready to learn it quickly.<p>* Proficiency with UNIX commands.<p>* Knowledge of relational databases and SQL, we use MySQL.<p>* Strong commitment to quality.<p>* Experience building and scaling user-focused web application.<p>* Being awesome and having a love for Shopify - Major Plus!","time":1367416353,"type":"comment"},{"by":"andrewljohnson","id":5640592,"parent":5637663,"text":"TrailBehind - Berkeley - California.\nSoftware Developer<p>We make the best outdoor GPS app - Gaia GPS, and other software for the network's fringe.

Familiarity with *nix based operating systems.\nAwareness of popular web APIs, such as Google Maps, Twitter and Facebook.\nMore important than relevant experience is the drive to learn and expand your skill set. If you've got a commitment to excellence and can demonstrate an aptitude for programming then we want to hear from you. In return you'll receive a competitive salary, full training and your own top of the range laptop (we work predominantly on Macs but we can let the odd Windows machine slip through the net!).<p>What you can expect to work on<p>Expect to work on a wide range of challenging projects. We don't have a cookie cutter approach to the web and push the design and technical envelope on all our work. Recent projects have included: an application that manages, filters and analyses radio spectrum data from a series of nationally-located nodes; a responsive website for a high-end safari and Africa travel company; a large website and online admin system to manage the ever-changing attractions and events for an interactive science centre; and a website/application that tracks, maps and graphs the progress of University spin-out companies. Most of our projects are responsive and we're as committed to the front-end user experience as we are to what's happening under the hood.<p>How we work<p>As a team we listen, learn, plan, design, build, test and deliver together. Whilst different people are responsible for their own part of a project, we all understand the importance of the chain and support each other to get things done. You'll be expected to manage your own workload and you won't ever have a project manager breathing down your neck. Our process is front-loaded with in-depth research and discovery rounds in which both developers and designers participate. This keeps scope creep to a minimum and deadlines and budgets realistic. We don't subscribe to unnecessary bureacracy and keep things streamlined and agile. You'll get to talk to clients too - we all share the successes and the challenges of a project together.<p>Learning<p>The web is constantly evolving so we expect you to as well. Experimentation and learning new skills is part of the fabric at Onespacemedia. Need some books or course materials? No problem. Want to try out some new techniques on a test project? No problem. Something you want to tell the world about a technology or trend? Blog about it on the website. We expect our team members to be passionate and knowledgeable about their field of expertise.<p>Lifestyle<p>Working at Onespacemedia is fun. We do serious work for serious clients but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy it. Expect plenty of laughter, music, company lunches, trips to the pub and impromptu ping pong battles. Just ten minutes walk from the station and ten minutes walk from the centre of Cambridge, the office is located just of Mill Road, the cultural heart of Cambridge (and probably the closest thing you can get to a London street outside of the capital). We're surrounded by green spaces, pubs, shops and cafés (including the legendary Hot Numbers). We've even got parking spaces. We operate a flexitime scheme too so those of you who are commuting from out of town don't have to spend four hours a day stuck in a traffic jam to and from work.<p>How to apply<p>Please send CV, covering note and links to any websites or applications you have created, or been involved with, to jobs@onespacemedia.com.

Knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and CSS also needed.<p>Front-end developer: you can make Web sites do exactly what you want them to do, regardless of the browser or operating system the web site is running on. Knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and CSS required.<p>Back-end developers: you know what it takes to power the back-end of large web sites. You understand scalability issues and can explain the difference between an inner and outer join. You know what O(log N) is and why it's important. Your programming language history isn't important because you're good enough to learn a new language if needed.<p>All positions: not looking for rock stars. Looking for competent technical talent who are willing to move to Europe (unless you're already here). We have many expats working here and we'll even help pay for Dutch lessons, if you want them.<p>We also like people who understand business because you'll be expected to make many of your own decisions without having to ask permission from management for every little thing that you do. You will have the power to get stuff done, work with a great bunch of people and be able to spend your five weeks of vacation time cruising across Europe and discovering why Amsterdam is such a beautiful city.<p>Company 2:<p>Unlike Company 1, Company 2 <i>is</i> looking for rock stars to bring to Amsterdam. They want front-end devs and system engineers. They want you to have at least a bachelor's degree in IT or a related field and you have to have a fairly impressive resume/CV (in terms of work, open source or educational background (preferably all three)) to even get an interview. In return, they offer a very agile environment, hard tasks, in a stable, long-term company. Large company, but each team gets a room with only a few people (no open-plan distractions). Management gets out of your way and meetings are discouraged. There's a heavy focus on constant performance optimization of systems because no one like a slow system. Multiple programming languages are used with the language being chosen to fit the problem and not the other way around.<p>Front-end devs: mostly PHP with Smarty and Propel, though other languages, such as Java,  and Python are used. You will be working on desktop, tablet and mobile applications and know Javascript and CSS fluently. This means more than just jQuery! Mobile experience is helpful, as it UX work.<p>System Engineers: you will be responsible for thousands of Linux servers across several data centers. Company 2 serves a quarter of a billion page views a day and heavy use of the latest open-source technologies is encouraged in their quest for better and better performance. Nginx, Puppet, stackless Python and MySQL are just a few of the technologies involved. The engineers are heavily involved in open source and are encouraged to give back to the community. You have deep experience in Linux, preferably multiple distributions, you know bash and at least one scripting language.

We have roughly 4,000 R&#38;D employees, so work is very diverse across the company. Teams are roughly 4-8 people at the lowest level and group up into larger organizations organized by product type (equities, fixed income, etc.). I happen to work on infrastructure for the Professional service (aka Terminal). Our team has very little interaction with anything finance related and most of our work is related to evolving the entire platform forward and making forward-looking changes. Back in 2005, we converted all of our higher-level \"app\" development to server-side JS (custom, Spidermonkey based) and now run probably the largest server-side JS stack in the world (~20MM LOC). We migrated a lot of our GUI toolkit to be scripted as well (LUA this time) to allow us to more easily evolve it. And now we're evolving it, embedding WebKit and pushing bugfixes and feature enhancements to do what we need (our fork is on GH). We're helping define and implement CSS3 Grid spec and help implement ES6 generators among other things. We built and run a third-party app store within the Terminal. Over the past decade we've rebuilt the C++ foundation of the company from the ground up, starting with our own STL implementation using the Lakos allocator model (Lakos and a few other C++ committee members work here). We have a huge wealth of awesome C++ libraries that we started open-sourcing and will continue to add more layers as time goes by.<p>All of what I mentioned above is stuff done by the infrastructure team, and we're a tiny percentage of the overall R&#38;D population. Other teams get to do fun stuff as well. The mortgage team ported long-running ABS OAS calculations from Linux farms to GPU clusters and wrote a Python based cash flow engine from the ground up, potentially helping define the SEC's Python-files-must-be-included rules.<p>We run a worldwide network with somewhere around 35,000 circuits in 180+ countries. We ingest anywhere from 45-60 billion \"ticks\" daily aggregate from feeds in all of these countries. We normalize, scrub, and then re-distribute all this data to customers in all of those countries in an efficient manner. The Terminal provides analytic and visualization tools to work with market data, as well as the same tools to work with news and alerts. On the news side, we ingest over 80,000 news feeds (e.g. WSJ would be one \"feed\") from around the world and do the same kind of processing, applying ML for sentiment and topic classification, etc. We also design our own hardware in-house -- everything from keyboards and monitors, to custom ASICs for authentication/subscription tokens and PCIe hardware security modules for our certificate infrastructure. The web side (bloomberg.com, businessweek.com, BGOV, BLAW, Black, etc) uses mostly Rails stacks and everything you would expect to find in a web shop.<p>Oh, and we have a TV station, radio station, etc. They innovate too. Bloomberg TV is the first non-OTA channel to be distributed via Aereo, for instance :)<p>We could use a motto like \"We do a lot of stuff.\"<p>Contact me if you want to discuss at andrew@ishiboo.com. If you want to chat in person, we are a sustaining sponsor of NYTM and are at all the meetups. and we'll have a few people at JSConf in May.","time":1367415112,"type":"comment"},{"by":"JackHerrick","id":5638821,"kids":[5638969],"parent":5637663,"text":"wikiHow (<a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Jobs</a>) - Palo Alto<p>We're \"Wikipedia for how-to\". We have over 40 million monthly users, but only 5 engineers.  That's 8 million users per engineer!<p>==Our vision==\nImagine a world where anyone can easily learn how to do anything. A world where access to comprehensive step-by-step instructions in multiple languages enables billions of people to improve their lives, in both ordinary and extraordinary ways. That’s the world we want to create.<p>==Where==\nwikiHow is located in a homey office in downtown Palo Alto, California, three blocks from the Palo Alto Caltrain Station. We also have satellite offices in Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington.<p>==Why we’re different==\n* We take wikiHow's educational mission seriously. We put our mission above short-term business goals.\n* We pay well. You get the joys of a nonprofit mission with a competitive for-profit salary and benefits package. \n* We have a huge number of users, but a very small team. Your work will make an immediate, noticeable impact on millions of people. \n* We all work from home one day a week.\n* We don't think working long startup hours is productive or healthy. We work hard and productively, then go enjoy rich lives outside of work. \n* Our small, cohesive team is gender balanced: 50% female, 50% male.\n* We’re often wrong (and that’s OK).  Making mistakes shows that we are innovating. We love to innovate.   \n* We like walking. We even have a few treadmill desks.\n* We love coming to work every day. Working with intelligent people to accomplish something globally ambitious is intrinsically satisfying. \n* We like to share. We develop open source software and Creative Commons licensed content.  \n* With over 40 million readers a month, wikiHow is one of the top 200 sites on the web. Even your mom will use and love our product.\n* We are profitable and growing. \n* We are self-funded. We refuse VC money on a regular basis. Investors don’t make our decisions, we do. \n* We are better in person than on TV:  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdfGsYyALI\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdfGsYyALI</a>\n* We're delightfully quirky (but you probably figured that out already).<p>=== A warning ===\nBefore you book an appointment with us, you should understand that wikiHow is not hoping to be acquired or looking for a quick financial exit. Our company is already profitable, financially stable (aka your job isn’t going away at someone’s whim), and we all love working here, so we aren’t in a rush to sell it to some big company. In fact, we think we are doing a pretty good job running it, and selling it might mean the end to a product that we all love working on. The team here shares a passion for helping the millions of people we reach everyday. It is an amazing feeling to work on such a popular and impactful product! That amazing feeling makes us smile when we wake up every day and think about going to work. If all of this sounds appealing to you, we encourage you to apply... If this is a bummer, then that’s okay too, we probably aren’t the best fit for you right now...and that’s totally fine!<p>===Engineering at wikiHow===\nWe have a five-person engineering team and over 40 million users.  That’s more than 8 million users per engineer!  Everything you build will make an immediate impact on millions of people.<p>Some of the problems wikiHow engineers are working on:\n* Building user-facing features for our volunteer editing community that are fun enough to gather mass usage, while simultaneously making sure the output of the work produces high-quality educational information. It’s easy to get people to upload funny cat memes on the Web; the real challenge comes when you want them to create and curate the world’s best instructional content. \n* Creating features to bring in new content contributors. To keep growing and achieve our goals, we solve how to enable contributors from mobile devices, as well as continuing to gain new desktop community members.\n* Scaling, scaling, scaling.  We get more users before 10 AM than most startups will get in their entire existence. \n* Big data. Lots of usage creates lots of data that we work with to further improve our products.\n* Mobile and tablets. The majority of wikiHow users will soon be on portable devices, but they don’t practice typical behavior patterns.  We are rethinking wikis and collaboratively created content for the mobile era. \n* Reader delight features. Better software means happier readers. We’re inventing new ways to make learning pleasant and more efficient.\n* Your awesome idea! We value our employees ideas and opinions, and most of our projects originate from people on the team.<p>Our stack:\nPHP, Mediawiki, MySQL, Bash, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Python, C++, Memcache, Varnish, Nginx, Linux, iOS, Android.

Engineers at Causes tend to be jack-of-all-trades, though we love people who have mastered a specific part of the stack, from front-end to back-end and all the data in between.

Read more about the positions at (<a href=\"http://causes.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://causes.com/jobs</a>)<p>Below are some common questions we get from engineers who are interested, and one of our awesome engineers has decided to answer them:<p>Q: What is your team environment like? \nA: The team environment is extremely open and loose. Our engineering team has a flat structure - one of our explicit goals is to create a space where we are all on equal footing to create opportunities to teach ourselves and learn from each other. We encourage everyone to be constantly questioning and evaluating our development processes so that we can keep getting better over time. Every engineer has a tremendous amount of power in terms of identifying what the most impactful things to be working on are, and to take on those challenges with the support of the team.<p>Q: Are you a pretty casual startup or more corporate styled? \nA: We have a couple key meetings each week. Each morning we have a standup that we expect the whole team to be present for; having the team start the day together is important to us. We finish each week with a retrospective where we gather around a whiteboard, have some drinks, and consider the process for the week. Taking time each week to reflect on what went well and how we can replicate success, as well as what didn't and how we can avoid similar mistakes in the future makes this feel like one of the healthiest teams I have ever been a part of.<p>Q: Do you guys pair program? \nA: We definitely encourage pairing - I probably spend about a quarter of my time coding with a partner, and I'm trying to find ways to do even more. We used to have pairing stations set up explicitly for this (two keyboards, two mice, four monitors), but as our team has gotten more comfortable with other solutions like screen sharing via tmux the pairing stations have gently fallen into disuse. I would love to hear what setups you have found to be successful in encouraging good pairing sessions. We're always looking to find more ways to effectively collaborate!<p>Q: What is the developer life like?\nA: In my opinion, the developer life at Causes is pretty spectacular. I get to work with some of the most awesome people I know, both technically and in a wide variety of other talents and interests. Jimmy, who leads our engineering team, used to be a performing stage magician. Rocky works with our Impact team and has represented the US in Ultimate Frisbee tournaments. There is a level of passion in my coworkers that I've never seen anywhere else, and I get to spend my time working, eating, talking, and playing with these people. As a developer, I get to work with fantastic technology. We are constantly upgrading our stack, and I often get to learn about things that are new to me. Most of our devs spend the day ssh'd into a workstation editing code in Vim, although we have one dev who tunnels the filesystem so that he can work in RubyMine, and at different times we have had folks working in TextMate, Sublime, Emacs, and Eclipse. All of our code goes through a code review tool called Gerrit that we use both to prevent software defects and as a way to teach each other about our craft. Gerrit is integrated with our Jenkins CI so that every patch has the complete test suite run against it before being merged.<p>We work in small development teams that generally include four developers, a product manager, and a designer. These teams give engineering access to the product design process that I haven't seen at the other companies I have been at. There's a neat sense of satisfaction when you are pairing with a designer to tweak a page into perfection. Working directly with the product team means that we get a lot of insight into what is coming down the pipe, and can often contribute to the direction of the product.<p>------------<p>Have you seen enough and you're now interested in joining the team?

Full time.<p>Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.<p>Many people believe that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:<p>- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.<p>- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.<p>- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the world’s scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.<p>- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world’s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world’s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.<p>It's an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas, based on the journal system, to a faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.<p>We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science. We have made a good start: 2.9 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 13,000 join each day.\nWe're a 12 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, and Mongodb. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.<p>Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:<p>* full stack engineers * growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels)<p>There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at <a href=\"http://academia.edu/hiring\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://academia.edu/hiring</a>.
