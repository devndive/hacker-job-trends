We&#x27;re looking for an awesome Senior Ruby Developer to join our growing team. If you&#x27;ve ever wanted to work for a interesting security startup with great people this is your chance. We&#x27;re a little different than your average startup so we put together this FAQ.<p>Q: Ok who are you guys?\nA: ThreatSim is comprised of some really smart security hackers who were tired of working for large companies. There are people here from Mitre, HP, Fortify, RSA, Verizon Business, Cybertrust, and others. We wanted to do the small company thing and it&#x27;s worked well for us.<p>Q: What would I be working on?\nA: You&#x27;d be working on our SaaS service, ThreatSim. It lets our customers send simulated phishing campaigns against themselves. When the user clicks on the simulated phishing link they are immediately shown training. It&#x27;s an unconventional approach to changing user behavior and it works (hint: we have data).<p>Essentially we get to think like bad guys and help our customers improve their security. It&#x27;s an interesting space to say the least. If you ever wanted to learn more about security and cutting-edge attacks, this is the place. We simulate evil AND give our customers data that they can use to protect their organization. You will spend a lot of time thinking &quot;if I was a bad guy I&#x27;d...&quot; then have to pivot and think &quot;if I was a security engineer I&#x27;d...&quot;.<p>Q: Where is this position located?\nA: This is a remote position that is open to US residents only located within the US. We understand that not every developer wants to move to SF, NYC, or DC so we let you work wherever you are productive.<p>Q: What technology to you use?\nA: ThreatSim is built entirely within Amazon Web Services.

Every day, people shake hands over million-dollar deals that can change the future of a company. From fundraising and acquisitions to partnerships, promotions and product placement, businesses get together and make new things happen.

From old school tie to the boardroom, why do people do business with each other? What are the trust and influence networks? What&#x27;s the equivalent of PageRank for investors? What does it mean when a VP moves from one company to another? How do I get my startup funded?<p>We&#x27;re trying to answer all these questions.

It inspired me to rethink the whole way we normally post a job. When looking for skilled likeminded people to join our team we shouldn’t make a job post; rather we should make a “company pitch”.\nMost job posts are dictating who you are and what you should do – a common sentence in a job post often goes like this: “you got a master degree in computer science and like to...” or “you will develop solution concepts by using...”. We don’t believe in such requirements. We don’t think of you as a work unit in a production line. Rather we seek talents and personalities whom we would want to invest in a relationship with. We firmly believe modern companies need to rethink the way in which they attract similar minded people. We must open our door and introduce our values; as this is the first step towards creating a bond. After all we are the team that want you to join us.<p>With that being said welcome to 3QAYJ.com (www.3QAYJ.com) – our company pitch project to attract you!<p><i></i>Our workflow is managed via<i></i><p>JIRA,CONFLUENCE<p>and all code submitting is handled through Github, pull request.\nOn a daily basis we communicate via hipchat and each Monday we have a weekly meeting via skype to touch base.

There are more than 5,000 rare genetic diseases, in total affecting millions of Americans, and our serious goal is to find treatments for 100 rare diseases in the next 10 years. We’ll need the best minds out there to help us make that happen.<p>Our approach is to model rare genetic diseases in human cells, then use these disease models to find drugs that revert the cells to a healthy state, and thus are strong candidates for impacting the disease in patients. In a pretty quick experiment, we image millions of human cells. Image segmentation and analysis quickly makes thousands of measurements, resulting in a very deep quantitation of the state of every single cell. The challenge at hand is running the right experiments in the right way and analyzing results to make the discoveries we seek as quickly as possible.<p>My two co-founders developed the basis of our approach at the University of Utah, using it to find two very promising candidates for a serious and fairly common genetic disease. We’re moving those candidates forward, and at the same time adapting the approach to address the thousands of other untreated rare genetic diseases as quickly as we can. I joined them to start this company because this is the best chance I’ve found for a software&#x2F;stats person to make such a huge impact on the lives of millions of people. I also believe that imaging-based biological experiments are going to be a big part of the wave of advancement coming to treating and curing diseases in the next two decades.<p>--<p>Software Engineer (Python):<p>- You have several years of experience in python software development, preferably using ipython and other scientific python tools. You’re also super-comfortable at the command line and handling the standard a linux server, and great at solving any kind of computational issue via stackoverflow. No sysadmins, DBAs or the like will be around to help for a while.<p>- You’re motivated by challenging problems, and by the idea of making millions of patients’ lives dramatically better, as fast as we can.<p>- You’ll work with biologists and data scientists to develop tools to manage and automate our experiments and analyses. To manage the experiments and analyses it will take to treat 100 diseases in 10 years, we’ll need a pretty amazing set of systems in place eventually, but need to get there incrementally so that we can make rapid progress immediately using the resources we have.<p>--<p>Lead Data Scientist (Python):<p>- You have several years of experience in statistics, machine learning, and software development solving problems and answering questions efficiently using lots of data, preferably using ipython and lots of python’s scientific programming tools. We’re not hadoop-scale for now, but every experiment can generate hundreds of gigs of quantitative measurements.<p>- You’re ready to take on any problem and figure out the best solution you can with available time, having fun in the process.<p>- Maybe you already know some biology, but if you don’t, you’re excited to learn what you need to (we’ll help, of course!) in order to really understand our data and approach.<p>- You’re motivated by challenging problems, and by the idea of making millions of patients’ lives dramatically better, as fast as we can.<p>- You’ll come to understand our experiments and data at a visceral level and help us guide the direction of our experiments and our company towards our goals.<p>- You’ll work with our biologists to guide our design&#x2F;experiment&#x2F;analyze cycle towards getting the most impactful biological information from the most rapid and cost-effective experimental approaches. This includes researching, suggesting and testing different statistical and machine learning approaches, along with changing our experimental setup to provide more useful information with every round of exeriments.

Interesting things, useful things, cool things. It&#x27;s like building with Legos, only you get paid, and there are always plenty of the right color pieces.<p>At TechEmpower, we build things. Interesting things. Cool things, mostly in webapp form. We build them as individuals, because we&#x27;re creative people. We build them as teams, because we like to help each other grow, and because we know that collaboration improves even the best code.<p>Having the best people doesn&#x27;t hurt, either. We&#x27;ve got most of them already, and we&#x27;re looking to find the rest. You can build things with us. What&#x27;s the catch? We&#x27;re pretty darn selective.<p>To work as an individual, you have to be motivated and creative and thoughtful and serious. To work on a team, you have to be respectful and energetic and open and absolutely not a jerk. We need developers who can work on every part of an application, from the data store to the page–sometimes known as full stack developers. And to be a full stack developer, you have to know technology and want to learn more technology, because those acronyms just keep coming.<p>Our clients expect us to work with them, not for them. We help them define their problems, and we provide solutions, on time and on target. We&#x27;re service-oriented, and you should be too.<p>Still reading? Please apply! And check out our Web Framework Benchmarks while you&#x27;re at it. We pretty much wrote the book on that one.<p>Just so you know:<p><pre><code>   Teams range between 2-6 people\n   Developers are exposed to 3-4 projects per year\n   All development is done on high-performance workstations with 4K displays.

Here is a snapshot of what we&#x27;re using now:<p><pre><code>   Languages: Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, PHP\n   Tools: Git, Jenkins (Continuous Integration), Sonar (static code analysis), Eclipse, IntelliJ, Ant, Maven\n   Web: Dropwizard, .NET MVC 5, Play, Django, Rails, Mustache, Handlebars, Backbone, Angular, Knockout, JSP, Servlets, jQuery, etc.\n   Mobile: iOS, Android, PhoneGap\n   Hosting: AWS (EC2, RDS, etc.), Rackspace Cloud, Linux deployments\n   Data Persistence: ORM (Hibernate, etc.), MySQL, Postgres, MS SQL Server, NoSQL (Redis, MongoDB)\n</code></pre>\nWe don&#x27;t expect new hires to have experience with all of these, but we do expect you&#x27;ll learn more about them every day.<p>If this sounds like the kind of place you&#x27;d like to work, please apply here: <a href=\"http://jobs.techempower.com/hn2\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.techempower.com&#x2F;hn2</a>","time":1409676055,"type":"comment"},{"by":"rchiba","id":8258534,"parent":8252715,"text":"Tint (<a href=\"http://www.tintup.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tintup.com</a>) — San Francisco (SOMA), CA - Full Time\nLooking for Full Stack Developers<p>-----------------------<p>ABOUT TINT<p>Tint&#x27;s mission is to help organizations drive deeper relationships with their customers through social media.

I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach?

On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean.

Resource accounting inside the network is settled with Bitcoin and purchases of compute instances can be made by users without an account. Additionally, groups of operators can form adhoc hybrid clouds, allowing fast scaling and sharing of excess compute resources between trusted entities. If you are familiar with cloud terminology, this idea may be one possible solution to some of the challenges in achieving a global cloud federation.<p>It is my belief that crypto currency technologies can bring a new category to the existing cloud offerings of compute, storage, and network. That new category is trust. While conversations about how crypto currencies affect our financial systems are definitely interesting, paying for compute, storage and network with stored trust is an awe inspiring vision of the future.<p>More information is available on the public Github repos for the project (keep in mind the utter.io site is not live yet): <a href=\"https://github.com/StackMonkey\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;StackMonkey</a><p>The fund raise for the Utter.io Open Source project will be done using decentralized raise methodologies sometime in early 2015 via token issuance similar to Ethereum, Maidsafe or Storj.  A more traditional fund raise is currently underway for StackMonkey, and will be used to build the first of many specific knowledge based offerings on top of the technologies being built with Utter.io.<p>---<p>Objectives and Team Overview<p>This is a pre-raise, core team buildout of roughly 4-5 individuals who will join me in an Open Source project that spans two distinct technologies: OpenStack and Bitcoin. Individuals are expected to be experts in at least one of these fields and moderately versed in the other.<p>I am 47, well versed in both technologies, program in Python&#x2F;JavaScript, have written all the software to date in the repositories, have started, run and exited other startups, live in the SF Bay Area, excel at fund raising, marketing, leading, and enabling individuals to grow in their careers. I am passionate about this project because I believe infrastructure is meant to be open, transparent and trustworthy. To me, there is no greater cause than providing individuals access to trustworthy commodity grade compute.<p>---<p>Desired Skills<p>Work will need to be conducted around operational crypto contracts, scheduling of Bitcoin micropayments, integration of blockchain nodes in the appliances, decentralized SSL tunnel solutions, OpenStack deployment methodologies, OpenStack SDN and general network architecture, distributed systems architecture, Python application frameworks, including AppEngine and Flask, UX&#x2F;UI&#x2F;design experience with operational software, and developer focused evangelism.<p>If you find this opportunity interesting, consider it worthy of your passion, and you are looking at a 2-3 month timeframe for a change in your career, please drop me a line.
