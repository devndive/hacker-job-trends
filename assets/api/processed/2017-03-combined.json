Teachers lead discussions, guide inquiry, pair programme with students, emphasise key areas, support students in their projects and challenges, and provide feedback to students and each other.<p>What we need is:<p>* Minimum 3 years experience with web development<p>* Knowledge of JavaScript&#x2F;EcmaScript 6, Node.js&#x2F;npm, React and Redux<p>* Someone who understands teaching and what it means to support a student’s learning journey.<p>A more complete description and application is available here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trademe.co.nz&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;it&#x2F;programming-development&#x2F;listing-1258410892.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trademe.co.nz&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;it&#x2F;programming-development&#x2F;lis...</a> .","time":1488398162,"type":"comment"},{"by":"dotzenlabs","id":13766109,"parent":13764728,"text":"RallyPoint (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rallypoint.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rallypoint.com</a>) | Boston, MA | Senior Software Engineer | Onsite | Full Time<p>About the Team\nWe are a small team tackling big problems.

The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.<p>- The reproducibility crisis. It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the scientific literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis&quot;<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 16 million pdfs to Academia.edu, and upload about 1 million a month. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to reproducibility, we think the way to solve the reproducibility crisis is to build a new peer review system that (a) crowd-sources peer review from the academic community and (b) provides credit to material that journals don&#x27;t publish (data-sets, code, replications, failed replications).<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (a) and (b). We realize that addressing reproducibility is a huge challenge. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us. We have raised $28 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes &quot;We believe open science is really important.

It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after four years, half of all schools in the US (68,000 schools) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of just over 100 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Golang, Node and React.

Jane Street’s technology group is small by design, which means we need to maximize the productivity of each person we hire. We believe functional programming (and specifically, OCaml) helps us do that. But it’s not about productivity alone: programming in a rich and expressive language like OCaml is just more fun. We’re also happy to spend time and money on making it easier for the people here to get things done. This ranges from big projects, like the work we do on development tools (e.g. Iron, our in-house code review and release management system, and Merlin, a tool for providing IDE-like features for OCaml), to little touches, like getting people whatever crazy keyboard will help them get their work done most comfortably.<p>Want to see some of our code?

We need data scientists who can understand our clients and can take a nebulous business goal, create a set of quantitative decision metrics, and build predictive models to optimize those metrics.<p>The extensive role of data scientists at Analytical Flavor Systems allows us to invest in their education across sensory perception (standard sensory science so they know what we’re improving and replacing), tasting experiences (so they appreciate the products we work on and understand how the data is collected), production knowledge (test batches in our R&amp;D brewery and roastery so they understand the data they work with and how our predictions impact a client’s process), and data science tear-downs (a meeting where the team collaboratively attempts to find and fix problems, try new techniques, and debate the philosophical implications of a model&#x27;s construction).<p>_Sales_: We prefer the thoughtful relationship builder to the cowboy negotiator. Most of our contracts are multi-year high-price affairs, so relationships are really important. Plus, you get to spend your time at breweries, distilleries and roasteries (I&#x27;ve personally never been to a sales meeting where beer or coffee wasn&#x27;t served freshly brewed).<p>Next Steps<p>Please submit something awesome to JasonCEO@Gastrograph.com to apply.","time":1488470730,"type":"comment"},{"by":"rtfeldman","id":13770329,"parent":13764728,"text":"NoRedInk | Front-end, Backend, Infrastructure Engineer | San Francisco, CA | REMOTE Pacific Time (PST) to Central European Time (CET)<p>We’re an ed-tech company on a mission to help all students become strong writers! Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 3 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 2 billion questions on our platform.<p>We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.<p>Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. We started with Ruby on Rails on our backend, and have lately been working to introduce Elixir to our stack. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]<p>In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.<p>We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using OpsWorks and Chef. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.<p>We’re hiring both engineers who have been around the block many times, as well as those who started their careers just a couple years ago. We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.<p>You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].<p>If you’re interested, please apply through our jobs page! <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;jobs</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;team\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;team</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NoRedInk&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NoRedInk&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;136615783598&#x2F;welcome-evan\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;136615783598&#x2F;welcome-evan</a><p>[5] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;145260396603&#x2F;our-engineering-hiring-process\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;145260396603&#x2F;our-engineering-h...</a><p>[6] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;143787279069&#x2F;on-boarding-as-a-new-remote-engineer-think-about\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;143787279069&#x2F;on-boarding-as-a-...</a>","time":1488415769,"type":"comment"},{"by":"whitperson","id":13769025,"parent":13764728,"text":"Sailthru | Lead Data Platforms Engineer | New York | <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;x4sbtp\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;x4sbtp</a><p>Sailthru | Senior Scrum Master | New York | <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;x4sbtp\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;x4sbtp</a><p>Sailthru | Senior Site Reliability Engineer | New York | <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;x4sbtp\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;x4sbtp</a><p>Sailthru | Senior UX Designer | New York | <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;x4sbtp\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;x4sbtp</a><p>Sailthru helps the world’s most innovative retailers and digital publishers build deeper and longer lasting relationships with their customers.

It doesn&#x27;t matter whether your resumé says PHP or PhD: if you&#x27;re smart, empathetic and know some stuff, we want to work with you.<p>We have many offices worldwide including SF, NYC, Toronto, London, Palo Alto (pivotal.io&#x2F;locations) and more coming.<p>We&#x27;re broken into three main divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Cloud R&amp;D and Big Data.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i> helps clients to become better at product development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. We pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud R&amp;D</i> is where we build the best cloud platform available: We&#x27;re the majority contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. Our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i> and it&#x27;s <i>still</i> zooming up and to the right.<p>Except for upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial cloud (Pivotal Web Services).<p>Cloud R&amp;D is also responsible for Pivotal Tracker and Spring.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is our suite of battled-hardened products, now open sourced. Greenplum tackles massive datasets with the comfort of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, donated as Apache Geode, is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, excellent benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong isn&#x27;t mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The NYC beer fridge has more IPAs than I prefer but I guess that&#x27;s life in paradise.<p>-- <i>Applying</i><p>To see open jobs and apply, see: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;xiy346\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;xiy346</a><p>You can also email me at jchester+hn-mar17@pivotal.io if you have questions.

We&#x27;re the skunkworks off-shoot of an existing logistics company, Experior Transport.
