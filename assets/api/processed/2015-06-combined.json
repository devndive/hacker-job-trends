In the process, we learned a ton about the world of government software. Many people know about the disastrous Healthcare.gov launch, but there&#x27;s a long list of huge technical problems that impact everyone in the US. A few examples: people are dying because the Veteran&#x27;s Administration is six months behind in processing claims, the IRS system goes down for regular maintenance every night, and the Social Security Administration is still paying benefits to millions of deceased Americans because their data is so poorly managed.<p>Over the past year, our team has seen an opportunity to create software that radically improves how our government serves its people, and we&#x27;ve started our company, Nava, to chase that vision.<p>You probably remember the initial launch of Healthcare.gov, but you might not have seen our relaunch in the news. That’s a good thing. Here are a few facts we can share: our new insurance application is processing 70% of all apps coming through the marketplace, converts 35% more people than the old app, gets them through in half the time, and is mobile-friendly (20% of applications were started on mobile). App 2.0 was the first system that CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) ever hosted on Amazon AWS, and the login system we just launched saves taxpayers $70 million a year. (Here&#x27;s a Wired article from last summer about us: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;06&#x2F;healthcare-gov-revamp&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;06&#x2F;healthcare-gov-revamp&#x2F;</a>)<p>We’re continuing to rebuild and improve Healthcare.gov while expanding in bold new directions, bringing talented engineers (we&#x27;re mainly Stanford, Google, and Y Combinator alums) to DC, the place where we&#x27;re needed most.

While this future has become clear to many, its essential implication remains elusive:  that in an all-container world, the old abstraction of the virtual machine becomes prohibitively confining -- a suffocating skeuomorph that incarcerates infrastructure in the past.  At Joyent, we believe in containers to our marrow -- and that the transition to native container infrastructure presents opportunities to fundamentally rethink computing, networking and storage systems.  We are looking for more people like us:  systems generalists who love to cut code -- software engineers who are afraid of neither the biggest of problems nor the grittiest details, who are comfortable in every stage of the software design and implementation process, and who find gratification in seeing their work available as open source.  We&#x27;re seeking engineers who are able to move up and down the stack: at any given time, we may find ourselves debugging a nasty device firmware bug, rewriting a portion of the operating system kernel, instrumenting the networking stack, debugging a virtual machine or interpreter, or developing code for a distributed system to allow containers to be understood or managed -- perhaps all in the same day or as part of the same problem.  We expect that you have detailed knowledge of a favorite language, tool or system, but that you are also able to quickly pick up new ones as needed.  And while implementation experience is essential, enthusiasm and interest can trump experience; we are willing to take a chance on someone who wants to step up.<p>We have immediate job opportunities in both downtown San Francisco and Vancouver (both close to mass transit) -- and we are remote-friendly in the US and Canada for those who have a track record of contributing to our open source communities (or who otherwise have a proven ability to work remotely).

It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and they have no information about the students who are using their software.  On the schools’ side, large districts are spending tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but the challenge of getting 30 kids to log in correctly makes using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after two and a half years, we’re moving data for a quarter of all K-12 students in America (16M kids), and 36,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.

We work at a scale where seemingly small improvements can have a big impact. You&#x27;ll be working right in the heart of the profit center.<p>Our division of Connexity works in online display advertising through RTB, and run 50 to 100 million impressions each day. Our total transaction volume is between 5 and 10 billion per day, and we&#x27;ve served ads on nearly every site you&#x27;ve ever visited.<p>We&#x27;re primarily looking for someone to contribute to our Rails app. It&#x27;s used to administer hundreds of advertising campaigns across hundreds of publisher sites. It&#x27;s not just boring CRUD. It&#x27;s the heart of our display advertising business.

In addition to the conventional Rails work, you&#x27;d get hands on experience with Redis, Hbase, PostgreSQL, and Scala. Several on the team started in the Rails app and have moved into other areas of interest (low-latency RTB bidder written in C or sophisticated reporting and optimization). It&#x27;s really possible to get bored around here unless you&#x27;re a boring person.<p>Our team is sharp and works well together. We enjoy perks such as paid lunch, a 9&#x2F;80 schedule (to get every other Friday off) and unlimited vacation; the culture of our team recognizes and respects the importance of your non-work life. Also, Ventura county is a pretty nice place to live&#x2F;work (unless you hate temperate coastal weather). If you&#x27;ve got Rails or other relevant web app experience, that&#x27;s a good start. More importantly, you&#x27;ll be eager to learn display advertising inside and out.

Our service is delivered primarily through a B2B web application targeting enterprise clients.<p>At cSubs you&#x27;ll work on large web applications for business, but help us bring a distinctly non-corporate user-focused sensibility to app design. We hold the occasionally contrary opinion that business people at work are still actual people, and we strive to make our web applications delight those people -- not just check the boxes on a corporate feature grid.<p>We care less about which specific languages you know than the fact that you have strong experience with more than one, and deep multi-year expertise with at least one. We&#x27;d love it if you have Python and CFML experience specifically, since we have a large CFML application running on the JVM using Railo&#x2F;Lucee -- but we also use Python, and are planning to transition much of our architecture to Python and PostgreSQL. As an expert, you would help spearhead this effort, alongside day-to-day development.<p>Because more and more of our application logic is moving to the front end, it&#x27;s critical that you have strong JavaScript knowledge and experience. You understand the architectural case for distributing application logic among the client and server, and you&#x27;re comfortable using at least one JS framework. While we don&#x27;t need you to be an expert with SQL, our applications run primarily atop relational databases, so it&#x27;s important that you have at least intermediate knowledge of SQL. While it&#x27;s not required, it would be great if you have enterprise integration experience in areas like single sign-on and punchout.<p>You will have contact with clients and client stakeholders, so you&#x27;re comfortable joining and occasionally leading calls and meetings.

This month, there will not be a post from Matasano Security.  Effective today, there will no longer be a Matasano Security.  Instead, we&#x27;re officially rebranding as NCC Group.<p>In late 2012, Matasano was acquired by NCC Group joining iSEC Partners and later Intrepidus Group.  Since that time, we&#x27;ve been working together, cross staffing projects and benefiting from each other’s expertise.  It&#x27;s been a slow, steady process of increasing cohesion.  We&#x27;ve reached the point where we need to assume a single identity, that of NCC Group.<p>Being a part of this process as it unfolds reminds me a bit of watching the Voltron cartoon series as a child in the &#x27;80s.  The show featured pilots each commanding their own robot lions.  Robot lions are fierce, powerful beings.  But when they came together they&#x27;d form Voltron - a giant humanoid robot with the lions compromising each of it&#x27;s parts.  I like to think this is what&#x27;s happening at NCC Group.  What were previously separate companies each well accomplished in computer security are becoming a single even more formidable entity. &quot;Form arms and body! And, I&#x27;ll form the head!&quot;<p>So, what does this have to do with hiring?<p>Growing a larger company requires a larger number of individuals.  We still need candidates with the same skills as always; programming, reverse engineering, protocol analysis, web application building&#x2F;breaking, adversarial thinking.  We need people who understand technology and can identify flaws in how it&#x27;s implemented.  We need those who can look at a security weakness, and accurately gauge it&#x27;s relative risk to the organization.  And we need folks who can communicate that risk to multiple audiences, in varying levels of detail.<p>There&#x27;s no better time than now to join us.  Our integration effort has opened up opportunity within the company to focus on areas of specialization, advance skills, and take on ever more complex projects and challenges.  If you&#x27;ve always wanted to be part of something new, but found yourself averse to the risk of early stage start ups, joining us now might be a way to do both.  We&#x27;re stable but we&#x27;re evolving and changing, and our employees will shape what we become.<p>If you want to learn more about us check out our:\n   Blog - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nccgroup.trust&#x2F;us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nccgroup.trust&#x2F;us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;</a>\n   Cryptopals - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptopals.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptopals.com&#x2F;</a>\n   Microcorruption - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;microcorruption.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;microcorruption.com&#x2F;</a><p>If you&#x27;re ready to apply, contact us at:\n   <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nccgroup.trust&#x2F;us&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nccgroup.trust&#x2F;us&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a><p>Please, bear with us on the sites above.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We just went to Portugal...where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way.

On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying.
