It&#x27;s really modern Java.  We use Dropwizard which is really wonderful if you haven&#x27;t checked it out (annotate paths similarly to how you&#x27;d use Flash in Python and just have the method return an object and Jackson will serialize it into JSON and return it - Java can be really nice).  For data, HBase, Hadoop, MySQL, ZoopKeeper, Redis, and Memcached all have their place.  Again, we deploy hundreds of times a day so don&#x27;t expect your code to languish in the repository.  We like pushing small changes fast.<p>On the front end, we use Backbone.js, CoffeeScript, and jQuery.

You&#x27;ll also get a Retina MacBook Pro and Thunderbolt display.<p>Work schedules are flexible.  Most engineers keep a 10-6 schedule.  You get to make a meaningful difference in a product with loads of paying customers and a ton of traffic.  Best of all, you get to work with loads of smart and fun people.

Every day, people shake hands over million-dollar deals that can change the future of a company. From fundraising and acquisitions to partnerships, promotions and product placement, businesses get together and make new things happen. But there&#x27;s no platform for them; they typically overload sales-focused CRMs, or are stuck in the world of spreadsheets and email. We&#x27;re changing that.<p>It&#x27;s a fascinating data problem as we&#x27;re mapping out professional and company-to-company networks, trying to understand who does business with whom and why, feeling our way around the underlying graph that nobody&#x27;s explicitly mapped out before. From old school tie to the boardroom, why do people do business with each other? What are the trust and influence networks? What&#x27;s the equivalent of PageRank for investors? What does it mean when a VP moves from one company to another? How do I get my startup funded?<p>We&#x27;re trying to answer all these questions. We have an invite-only product already launched, we&#x27;re building a team-facing solution, and we&#x27;re expanding our data team to work on the platform that powers it all.

Fantasy Sports is a booming industry that is growing every year and has one of the most passionate and engaged users on the web.\nWe have several positions that we are currently trying to hire for as we try to bring home the championship. Sports and fantasy knowledge is a plus, but not required. Just a willingness to get a little crazy and watch sports! Watching sports will be a part of your job, how cool is that? Here is what we are hiring for:<p>1. Data Scientist - We have some of the largest warehouses of both user generated and sports data anywhere. This is a sports nuts&#x27; dream! Apply for this if you love figuring out what users are doing and how to iterate on the product based on numbers.<p>2. Backend engineer - We are creating a new, state of the art backend infrastructure. Fantasy Sports is one of the most challenging backends on the web, due to the spiky nature of traffic. During an NFL Sunday, our peak RPS can exceed twitter! Apply for this if you love massive scaling and performance optimization.<p>3. Mobile engineer - Looking for both iOS and Android expertise.

Our core mission is twofold: to provide a platform for chefs to grow their independent businesses, while making it possible for people to connect over great food.<p>- Line chefs at the nicest restaurants in the world make at most $12-15&#x2F;hour, yet the food they make is sold to diners at a hefty markup. We&#x27;re trying to bridge the gap.<p>- People are conditioned to expect great food in restaurants — and rarely elsewhere. We want to change the way people eat, while preserving the efficiency and hospitality of a great restaurant experience.<p>- Most internet service companies attempt to decrease human interaction through software efficiency. We’re building a company that does the opposite. We think there&#x27;s something magical about having a chef in your kitchen while you relax and enjoy the company of your guests.<p>How we&#x27;re doing it:<p>- We’re committed to code quality and productivity. With those values in mind, we pair program, test drive and practice continuous integration in a Rails environment. We don&#x27;t work &#x27;startup hours&#x27;, just normal ones.<p>- We&#x27;re a small team (currently 6 engineers). We rotate often between pairs and across projects.<p>- We deploy code whenever we finish a feature. As an example, last week we deployed to production 35 times.<p>- We have a collaborative culture where engineers work directly with product managers and designers to find the best solution to user problems.<p>- We work out of a townhouse in Gowanus right now, but are moving to Soho very soon.<p>Who we&#x27;re looking for:<p>- You&#x27;re interested in working with Rails and pair programming the majority of the time. You want to write tests for any feature you implement.<p>- You&#x27;re more interested in building a great product and shipping features than you are in figuring out the cleverest solution to a problem.<p>- You want to enjoy coming to work each day.<p>My name is Dan, I&#x27;m an engineer here at Kitchensurfing.

We&#x27;re hiring for full time positions as software developers and software designers at our office in Grand Rapids.<p>A little bit about us:<p><pre><code>  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US.\n\n  - We aren&#x27;t limited to any really specific set of technologies, which is a great\n    opportunity to learn. In the past year, I&#x27;ve worked with Objective-C (and Swift),\n    Backbone.js (inside PhoneGap), Angular.js, QT Node.js, and of course Ruby.\n\n  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,\n    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and &gt; 40 hour weeks are\n    rare by design.\n\n  - We&#x27;re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.\n\n  - We offer competitive salaries, health&#x2F;vision&#x2F;dental insurance, quarterly profit\n    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office\n    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.\n\n  - We run a makerspace in our building (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grmakers.com), which gives us access\n    to lots of cool stuff like a laser cutter and 3D printers.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about Grand Rapids:<p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.\n\n  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in\n    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a “World Class” bar on BA.\n    Just look here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;beeradvocate.com&#x2F;beerfly&#x2F;city&#x2F;43\n\n  - Low cost of living. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment\n    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.\n\n  - A growing technology and startup community.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love making software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.\n\n  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not\n    afraid to use more. You have some experience with web or mobile technologies.\n\n  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.\n\n  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m a software craftsman on this awesome team.

Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s awesome: we have non-technical customers paying us for an online tool. Everyday, our clients call and email to say that we&#x27;re making them happy. And that feels great.<p>But there&#x27;s one problem: parts of our product are a little bit ugly and a little bit confusing. We&#x27;re rapidly adding new features, and we&#x27;re quickly outpacing our design capabilities. In short, it’s time to hire a UX&#x2F;UI designer.<p>Our clients use our product for hours at a time. This is their tool for getting their jobs done. It is their workflow. We want it to beautiful and intuitive. It should be easy for a new client to learn, while at the same time, it should make power users feel like they’re flying through their day.<p>You must have experience with The Struggle of Application Design. And frankly, you should enjoy this struggle, because it’s hard to get things right, but really rewarding when you do.<p>What would your first day on the job be like? Well, we’ve got a product live right now that processes several hundred orders per day. You now own the design and you will be responsible for improving it. Changes could be simple, like, ‘make this button blue’ or it could be more elaborate like, ‘add tooltips and a new customer tutorial,’ or maybe you might want to redesign aspects of the site from scratch. Ideally, within a couple weeks, clients should be telling us that they’ve noticed small, nice design improvements.<p>List of Responsibilities: - Design - Usability and Utility are more important (at the moment) than purely visual appeal. As a team, we frequently meet with our clients to learn how they’re using the product. A good candidate for this role will be able to speak to users and feel out their feelings.<p>List of Skills: - UI&#x2F;UX design experience - Responsive design experience (a lot of our clients access our site on their phones) - HTML&#x2F;CSS is great. At the moment, we’re using a lot of Bootstrap. Pixel perfect designs are not (yet) crucial; usability is paramount.<p>We’re in San Francisco on a trolley-filled street in Union Square.

We’re a tech startup creating corporate and consumer products to measure and enhance wellbeing and productivity. There are two strands to what we do. First, we quantify cognitive and psychological states, such as attention or happiness. Second, we deliver interventions, such as mindfulness, to boost cognitive and psychological skills. Web and mobile apps are key to both these strands.<p>WHO WE ARE. Our backgrounds span finance, psychology, technology, and design. CTO George leads on the measurement side, having mapped the nation’s wellbeing with the Mappiness app (<a href=\"http://mappiness.org.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mappiness.org.uk</a>). CEO Nick leads on interventions, as the former Head of Research for successful mindfulness app Headspace (<a href=\"http://www.getsomeheadspace.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getsomeheadspace.com</a>).<p>WHAT WE USE. We love CoffeeScript, both in the browser and for our internal app logic. Our back-end is largely Postgres and Ruby. We could imagine using Node, Python, Go and&#x2F;or R at some point; maybe other things too. Our iOS apps are C and Objective-C, of course, with liberal use of SpriteKit and Accelerate. We’ve tried RubyMotion (impressive, but probably not for us) and we’re playing with Swift. Our Android apps don’t exist yet, and that might be where you come in.<p>WHO YOU MIGHT BE. We’re looking for someone smart, opinionated, and enthusiastic (in the face of interesting work). Someone with solid experience in web, Android (especially) and&#x2F;or iOS app development, who likes learning, and who agrees that UX is the most important — and usually the hardest — thing to get right. Bonus points for any of: user testing, sysadmin or database expertise; an interesting technical blog or Github&#x2F;BitBucket profile; and an interest in mindfulness or subjective wellbeing.<p>WHERE WE’RE AT. Geographically we’re currently at Nuffield Health&#x27;s offices in Epsom (free gym and lovely offices), but a move to London (or just possibly Brighton) is likely in the works over the next 6 months. We have just completed our first investment round. Currently our CTO does all development, so you’d be our first developer hire. That means we can be flexible about the work you take on, playing to your strengths and your preferences.

There are more than 5,000 rare genetic diseases, in total affecting millions of Americans, and our serious goal is to find treatments for 100 rare diseases in the next 10 years. We’ll need the best minds out there to help us make that happen.<p>Our approach is to model rare genetic diseases in human cells, then use these disease models to find drugs that revert the cells to a healthy state, and thus are strong candidates for impacting the disease in patients. In a pretty quick experiment, we image millions of human cells. Image segmentation and analysis quickly makes thousands of measurements, resulting in a very deep quantitation of the state of every single cell. The challenge at hand is running the right experiments in the right way and analyzing results to make the discoveries we seek as quickly as possible.<p>My two co-founders developed the basis of our approach at the University of Utah, using it to find two very promising candidates for a serious and fairly common genetic disease. We’re moving those candidates forward, and at the same time adapting the approach to address the thousands of other untreated rare genetic diseases as quickly as we can. I joined them to start this company because this is the best chance I’ve found for a software&#x2F;stats person to make such a huge impact on the lives of millions of people. I also believe that imaging-based biological experiments are going to be a big part of the wave of advancement coming to treating and curing diseases in the next two decades.<p>--<p>Software Engineer (Python):<p>- You have several years of experience in python software development, preferably using ipython and other scientific python tools. You’re also super-comfortable at the command line and handling the standard a linux server, and great at solving any kind of computational issue via stackoverflow. No sysadmins, DBAs or the like will be around to help for a while.<p>- You’re motivated by challenging problems, and by the idea of making millions of patients’ lives dramatically better, as fast as we can.<p>- You’ll work with biologists and data scientists to develop tools to manage and automate our experiments and analyses. To manage the experiments and analyses it will take to treat 100 diseases in 10 years, we’ll need a pretty amazing set of systems in place eventually, but need to get there incrementally so that we can make rapid progress immediately using the resources we have.<p>--<p>Lead Data Scientist (Python):<p>- You have several years of experience in statistics, machine learning, and software development solving problems and answering questions efficiently using lots of data, preferably using ipython and lots of python’s scientific programming tools. We’re not hadoop-scale for now, but every experiment can generate hundreds of gigs of quantitative measurements.<p>- You’re ready to take on any problem and figure out the best solution you can with available time, having fun in the process.<p>- Maybe you already know some biology, but if you don’t, you’re excited to learn what you need to (we’ll help, of course!) in order to really understand our data and approach.<p>- You’re motivated by challenging problems, and by the idea of making millions of patients’ lives dramatically better, as fast as we can.<p>- You’ll come to understand our experiments and data at a visceral level and help us guide the direction of our experiments and our company towards our goals.<p>- You’ll work with our biologists to guide our design&#x2F;experiment&#x2F;analyze cycle towards getting the most impactful biological information from the most rapid and cost-effective experimental approaches. This includes researching, suggesting and testing different statistical and machine learning approaches, along with changing our experimental setup to provide more useful information with every round of exeriments.

Interesting things. Cool things, mostly in webapp form. We build them as individuals, because we&#x27;re creative people.

And to be a full stack developer, you have to know technology and want to learn more technology, because those acronyms just keep coming.<p>Our clients expect us to work with them, not for them.

The position will work with an experienced group of software engineers to develop software supporting the tracking of laboratory data and analysis processes to support large scale genomic research projects. The Genome Institute has been at the forefront of genome research since its inception in 1993 and has been a part of major scientific projects such as the Human Genome, 1000 Genomes and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) Projects. The Genome Institute is a world-leader in the generation and analysis of genomic sequence data and uses this data to extend biological knowledge of the human genome and provide clinically relevant sequence analysis aimed at understanding human diseases (such as cancer and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease). In addition, the Institute fosters public understanding of genomic science through various educational and outreach efforts.<p>REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS<p>Certification or degree in computer programming from a technical school or college plus two years of relevant work experience required.

The candidate will be expected to learn new things on a regular basis, think critically, and collaborate with other developers across groups. The environment is fast-paced and a person who likes to get things done will find a lot of opportunity. Design, testing, debugging, and problem analysis are a regular part of the work. Skills in abstract software design, object-oriented architecture, relational data modeling, and web interface design will be used frequently, which will require thorough knowledge of each concept. The applicant will use these skills to develop software that will: interface with people and&#x2F;or laboratory equipment, process and analyze large data sets on a compute cluster, and provide intuitive web based interfaces to the specifications of the laboratory managers and technicians. Proficiency in dynamically typed languages (Perl, Ruby, Python, Lisp, etc.) is a plus, but not required. Understanding of relational databases and SQL will be helpful. Experience with web technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and approaches such as REST and AJAX is an asset. Regular work will be done in GNU&#x2F;Linux and other UNIX-like development environments. Familiarity with open source technologies, version control software such as git, and programming in a network environment are also assets.<p>SALARY RANGE<p>The hiring range for this position is commensurate with experience.<p>DEPARTMENT SUMMARY<p>One of only three NIH-funded large-scale genome centers in the United States, The Genome Institute at Washington University is a leader in genomics research as it applies to the study of biology, human disease and the field of personalized medicine. Founded in 1993, The Genome Institute focuses on cancer genomics, the genomics of heritable diseases, microbial and pathogen genomics, as well as novel sequencing and evolutionary genomics.\nOur mission is to help improve the human condition by producing, studying, and interpreting high-quality genome-based data that drives biological discoveries that range from the bench to the hospital bedside.

Remote position (ideally within Canada).<p>--- The Job ---------------------------------<p>We are looking for an experienced, effective senior developer who can take on a leadership role on our team. We have two established products - www.searchtempest.com and www.autotempest.com - but we also have a list of desired features a mile long, so we need your help to continue to delight our users, and hopefully pick up a few more along the way!<p>Your first major task will be to help us transition SearchTempest from a classic server-side application to a client-side MVC framework.  We expect to achieve a fairly dramatic improvement in perceived speed of the site by removing unnecessary processing on page load, and increasing parallelization.  However, this is only one task among many.  We are looking for a highly skilled and motivated developer who can help us continue to improve all aspects of our sites.<p>--- Skills &amp; Requirements--------------------<p>You will need advanced knowledge of modern javascript frameworks - preferably Angular, but we would consider Ember or Backbone&#x2F;Marionette if you make a strong case. Also PHP (we use the Symfony2 and Slim frameworks), and SQL. (“Advanced” means you should be comfortable personally leading architecture and development using these tools.)<p>Even more importantly, you must be comfortable (and ideally experienced) working on a remote team.  Working from your preferred environment, at your preferred times, can be great for productivity (and enjoyment!) - but only if you have exceptional self-motivation. You should also be effective at communicating via chat, email, and video-conferencing (Google Hangouts), and using a project tracking tool (we use Pivotal).<p>As a senior developer, you will be designing program architecture, writing specs for yourself and other developers to follow, and reviewing code, as well as hands-on coding.<p><i></i>High Priority Skills:<i></i><p><pre><code>    - Client-side MVC with AngularJS (or a comparable framework)\n    - Back-end development using PHP and a modern framework (ideally Symfony2)\n    - Database design and maintenance (MySQL&#x2F;MariaDB). Familiar with concepts like \n      normalization, index selection, query optimization, caching, etc.\n    - Testable program design and unit testing\n</code></pre>\n<i></i>Nice to Have:<i></i><p><pre><code>    - Coffeescript, Twig, Handlebars, Compass&#x2F;sass, Composer, Grunt\n    - Responsive design and development\n    - Experience testing with PHPUnit and Behat&#x2F;Mink\n    - Experience working with APIs such as YQL, Google Maps, eBay, AWS, etc.\n</code></pre>\n<i></i>Bonus:<i></i><p><pre><code>    - Visual web design and&#x2F;or graphics design\n    - App development for iOS and&#x2F;or Android\n    - System Administration; shell scripting, familiarity with provisioning tools\n      such as Puppet and Chef\n</code></pre>\n--- About Us -------------------------------<p>We are a small web company based in Victoria, BC, Canada. Basically, we build handy little tools to make people&#x27;s lives a little bit easier. Our current sites are <a href=\"http://www.searchtempest.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.searchtempest.com</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.autotempest.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.autotempest.com</a>. SearchTempest is a search engine for classifieds (which is actually more useful than it sounds!) Search multiple craigslist cities by distance from your location, plus eBay, Amazon, etc., without having to type in the same stuff over and over.<p>AutoTempest is a similar idea for used car shoppers; it lets you search all the top cars sites at once, with the results in one big list (optionally sorted by price, distance, etc.) If you&#x27;re serious about finding a good deal on a car, you&#x27;re searching all these sites anyway, so we save you most of the effort.<p>We believe in a flexible, results-driven work environment. We all work from home, using the tools we choose, at the times we feel most productive. We keep in sync with Pivotal Tracker, XMPP chat, BitBucket, email, and occasional Google Hangouts meetings.<p>Everyone on our team has a significant role to play. Remote work and flexible hours mean we can each work when and where we prefer, but they also mean we have to be highly self-motivated and communicate effectively to be productive. It also helps when you really love what you do.

Additionally, groups of operators can form adhoc hybrid clouds, allowing fast scaling and sharing of excess compute resources between trusted entities.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We are going to Portugal in September! Want to come?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http://we.are.expensify.com/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com&#x2F;apply</a>).
