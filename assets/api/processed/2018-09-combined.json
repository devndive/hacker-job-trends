We don&#x27;t hire for this team very often, but we&#x27;re looking to hire a couple of people now.  We last posted on this thread about a year ago, and successfully found someone who now works on the current team, so we&#x27;re trying it again.<p>Despite our small size, we&#x27;re in charge of a number of important products.  We run the software that powers YC&#x27;s application process, software that almost every investor in silicon valley uses (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.ycombinator.com&#x2F;investor-day-software&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.ycombinator.com&#x2F;investor-day-software&#x2F;</a>), and Bookface, a private community site that is very actively used by YC founders.  This year we launched two big new projects - Startup School (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;startupschool.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;startupschool.com&#x2F;</a>) and Work at a Startup (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;workatastartup.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;workatastartup.com&#x2F;</a>).  Those new projects are going very well - we have over 26K founders signed up for Startup School - and we want to double down on them.<p>An unusual aspect of being on the YC software team is that you&#x27;ll get full access to the YC program, founders and partners - from our dinner talks to demo day.  You&#x27;ll learn the ins and outs of how YC works, and you&#x27;ll get to know and learn from hundreds of companies.  If you want to start a startup someday, working at YC would be an excellent jumping off point.<p>We also offer highly competitive compensation and benefits, including equity in YC&#x27;s portfolio.

So we are now looking into rewriting certain performance-sensitive parts of the static analyzer (such as file parsers) in a faster language. We think Rust especially well suited for this task, due to its safety guarantees, which are naturally important when working with malicious files, as well as its good interoperability with Python.<p>Since we have no experience with designing and implementing software in Rust yet, we are looking for a seasoned Rust developer to help us out. Aside from developing on the static analyzer, our &quot;Rust guy&quot; should be willing and able to mentor other team members to get up to speed with the language, as necessary.<p>If that sounds interesting to you, please consider applying at: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.vmray.com&#x2F;apply-software-engineer-rust-en&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.vmray.com&#x2F;apply-software-engineer-rust-en&#x2F;</a>.\nI&#x27;m also happy to answer any questions you might have, just shoot me an email at jteske [at] vmray [dot] com!","time":1536267738,"type":"comment"},{"by":"vivcomma","id":17905131,"parent":17902901,"text":"OPEN SOURCE SELF DRIVING CAR <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;commaai&#x2F;openpilot\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;commaai&#x2F;openpilot</a><p>Here&#x27;s the plan: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@comma_ai&#x2F;our-road-to-self-driving-victory-603a9ed20204\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@comma_ai&#x2F;our-road-to-self-driving-victor...</a><p>There are no requirements beyond writing good code.

DApps are trustless, transparent, interoperable, and unstoppable, and thus have the potential to empower users in unprecedented ways.<p>But just like how web 2.0 did not take off until it started seeing usage outside of the military and academia, blockchains are not going to take off until DApps are being used by the average consumers. And yet, it’s the unfortunate reality today that DApps have very little usage outside of finance. The reason is that it’s currently extremely difficult to create DApps that can handle a large number of users efficiently, due to technical limitations with existing blockchains and the lack of good tooling for building DApps.<p>Binary Mint is all about creating technologies that will make consumer DApps a reality.

We close the information gap between a physical worksite and the people who manage it. We believe that everyone should be able to measure and manage their worksite themselves.<p>Our top-tier team puts the power of drone imagery into a user-friendly toolkit. We do this through our 3D, cloud-based platform, where sophisticated engineering and photogrammetry meets intuitive design and simple workflows. Supported by our engineering team and AeroPoints hardware, we translate raw site data into readable, actionable information for our users.<p>Great engineering is our keystone. Without it, we couldn’t be good translators and our vision would be unworkable. It’s our practical, results-driven side. It’s the “how” of solving everyday problems.
