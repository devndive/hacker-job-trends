It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after four years, almost half of all schools in the US (64,000 schools) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of 120 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Node and React.

We use the health data we collect in order to intelligently allot care resources to the specific needs of patients, paying special attention to the most-critical patients.

The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.<p>- The reproducibility crisis. It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the scientific literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis&quot;<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 14 million pdfs to Academia.edu, and upload about 1 million a month. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to reproducibility, we think the way to solve the reproducibility crisis is to build a new peer review system that (a) crowd-sources peer review from the academic community and (b) provides credit to material that journals don&#x27;t publish (data-sets, code, replications, failed replications).<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (a) and (b). We realize that addressing reproducibility is a huge challenge. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us. We have raised $28 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes &quot;We believe open science is really important.

We use a custom service bus to tie our SOA together, microservices style. We love Docker, CoreOS, postgres, automated testing, and continuos integration. We&#x27;ve got some neat in-house tools for service discovery, health checks, cluster setup and deploy and more.<p>As a company, we&#x27;re strong believers in transparency, trust and balance. As an engineering team, we believe good code is easy to read and should have a short &quot;time to understanding&quot;. We expect all of our engineers to continually teach as well as learn. We also believe that everyone should write good code, yet balance that against the need to ship.<p>We&#x27;ve got a ton of interesting problems to solve around distributed systems, data analytics and predictions, complex data modeling, ultra high-availability, security, privacy and more.<p>We&#x27;re currently looking for experienced SW engineers up and down the stack.

At Yammer, we hire smart people, expect them to learn and grow, and trust them to make day-to-day decisions.

We provide the first comprehensive, low-latency view of demand and inventory across all distribution channels. Our platform connects manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and retailers, allowing companies to track their products down to the store shelf and better respond to end-consumer demand.<p>We are early stage, well funded by leading VCs, and growing. Our small team has diverse backgrounds and experience in analytics, large-scale enterprise software, and retail and financial technology. Culture really matters to us: we value diversity in all forms and strive to foster integrity, respect, and open communication.<p>We&#x27;re committed to make enterprise software inspiring.

We are a small team and encourage autonomy, so we do asynchronous daily updates (accomplishments, blockers, collaboration needs) but try to avoid getting too bogged down in process or unnecessary meetings. We value accomplishments, not time-in-office, so we try to optimize our process around allowing flexibility and personal accountability.<p>Tech Stack:\nOur website and API are powered by Ruby on Rails, our experiment tools and platform use Angular.js, our real-time features use Node.js, and we have a handful of microservices related to our data pipeline using Python. On the database side, we use Redis to coordinate services and Postgres for our primary data store. We’re especially interested in candidates with Ruby, Javascript, and Angular experience, but for the right candidate we’re open to other languages&#x2F;platform experience with a demonstrated track record for learning new technology. Although everyone wears a lot of hats at an early startup like Ardusat, this position will be more backend focused, so experience with server management, cloud platforms (we use AWS), Docker, CI, or API design is a plus (although not required). Experience with &quot;maker&quot; technologies including Arduino, Raspberry Pi, 3D printing, etc. is also a plus.<p>Apply or request more details: jobs@ardusat.com\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ardusat.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ardusat.com&#x2F;jobs</a> for more details.","time":1475511412,"type":"comment"},{"by":"debuggest","id":12628326,"parent":12627852,"text":"InComm | Portland, Atlanta, Salt Lake City | Software Engineer | ONSITE | Full Time | <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers-incomm.icims.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;search?ss=1&amp;searchKeyword=engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers-incomm.icims.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;search?ss=1&amp;searchKeyw...</a><p>InComm is hiring for many positions.

The group is a mixed local&#x2F;remote team, but all of the currently open positions are ONSITE. Our interview process is phone conversation followed by onsite interview.<p>NYGC is not a software company; it is a sequencing lab trying to push science at scale, and needs software to do so. We have gone from zero to top-three in five years, and we are hungry to become the leader. We&#x27;re aggressively scaling our clinical services, so if you have even the smallest allergy to documentation or process, please stop reading now.<p>These positions are for the automation group, which currently has ten people. NYGC is graduating from successful startup to a medium-sized company. In software, we&#x27;re replacing duct tape with small applications, and introducing larger applications to help people with scale. We also introduce duct tape to make impossible things happen. People who join NYGC software are expected to learn quickly, be self-motivated, and be comfortable switching tracks. You don&#x27;t have to understand e.g. genome sequence alignment, but you do have to be able to read a manual on a tool&#x27;s use and learn enough vocabulary to have an intelligent conversation with an expert on the subject.<p>This group uses python and postgresql, adding minimal javascript when making frontend applications.

We design everything for reliability, maintenance, low cost of ownership, and failure recovery. It is a combination of boring technology and fast pace: we are the computational pipeline team, the automation team, the LIMS team, the database team, the data transport team (surprisingly fun at &gt;20PB), the customer delivery team, the JIRA team. We don&#x27;t do genomic methods software (e.g. better variant calling) -- we have a great computational biology group for that. Our team is not Agile, but our business is. We make it all run at scale, on our local cluster of &gt;6k cores. This group is focused on making a sequencing lab and automated analyses run at scale.<p>The lab and automation combined drive some really interesting real-world problems, particularly in the clinical space. How fast can we get first-order cancer screening to sick people?

Penetration testing, security analysis, and cutting-edge research into current technologies and attacks (breaking things).

Your work will typically initiate person-months of security improvements in products millions of people use.

Our engineers combine creativity, curiosity, and drive to continuously perfect and revolutionize Jet from the inside out. We are looking to bring more intellectually curious engineers who are passionate about technology in general (Jet is a technology first company and prides itself on its culture of learning and knowledge sharing and we want all our engineers to be as passionate as we are!)<p>Our platform is largely an event driven platform implemented via a microservice architecture. The platform runs on Microsoft Azure and uses a large number of technologies and middle ware. The bulk of backend code is written in a functional style (F#) and our system of record is an event sourced system (essentially a log of all actions on the platform). We use a mix of Kafka, Redis, Elastic Search, Azure SQL, Event Store and Azure Storage for our data stores. About 50% of the platform runs on Linux and the rest Windows (although we move into more containerization we will see a shift towards Linux).<p>----------<p>I&#x27;ve been working at Jet since mid-February, and I can honestly say this is the best job I&#x27;ve ever had. It personally checks off every single box I could have a for a dream job:<p>- Incredible growth. We were the fastest startup to hit a billion dollar valuation, and we just got bought by Walmart for 3.3 billion. With the Fortune 1 at our backs there are some really amazing opportunities and projects that are just getting started.<p>- Functional programming in F#. Never been more productive coding. And in general we have a very modern tech stack that is a pleasure to work with.<p>- Tech talks and workshops all the time. I&#x27;m learning more than I ever have.<p>- Extremely competent management. It feels like they really care about employees&#x27; happiness here, we&#x27;ve got experienced people at the helm, and it is amazing to see what a company can look like when you have a fantastic management team bringing their A-game. Really, it&#x27;s incredible to have to try hard to find something to complain about.<p>- All the trappings of modern startup life. Free gym membership, lots of free food, etc.<p>We&#x27;re hiring people of all different types of experience for all different types of roles.
