A few months ago our recruiting process was going well enough that we had a comment in our HN post from a candidate we&#x27;d passed on who was happy enough with the experience that they recommended us in the thread [1]. Last month, however we had the exact opposite experience. Two candidates commented about investing significant effort in the process, only to be ghosted [2].<p>I arrived at those comments too late to reply, so I&#x27;m using this month&#x27;s post to apologize. I dug into what happened here and found that we did indeed drop the ball with a few candidates and failed to follow up. Certainly it wasn&#x27;t our intent and doesn&#x27;t reflect our values. We&#x27;ve audited the entire candidate pool and have reached out to anyone that fell through the cracks to properly close the loop.  I personally apologize for your poor experiences and the criticism is well deserved.<p>I also want to thank the people who commented.

We aim to drive the entire smart contract space forward with this project. Qtum is still young, and has been around for around 1.5 years. We use a fully remote workflow but typically try to all meetup in Shanghai once a year or so. We have team members based around the world, including China, USA, Canada, Sweden, Morocco, Colombia, and many others.<p>We are currently looking to expand our engineering team by 1 or 2 well experienced people. First of all, no blockchain experience is necessary (though it is always helpful). Qtum is aiming to implement an x86 virtual machine on which smart contracts can be executed. So, we need people to help us build the virtual machine, and test it to make sure it is correct (since fixing mistakes is very hard). We are also looking not just for engineers to build the virtual machine, but also to craft an operating system-like environment in which smart contracts can run. So, this may provide common necessities like memory allocation, string manipulation, etc... along with porting languages like C++, Rust, and Go to be easily used within the smart contract environment.<p>So, in summary we are looking for someone that loves working at the low level, bare metal level. If you have operating system development experience, that&#x27;s a plus. If you live and breathe assembler, we&#x27;d like to speak with you. No matter if your preferred architecture is x86, ARM, or whatever. Even if you made a cool Z80 assembly program for your TI-84. It&#x27;s all good stuff. We will be implementing most of the core logic in C++, but Rust and Go experience is a plus, especially with low level experience porting or dealing with the low-level details of the compilers and operating environment.<p>We take testing and code reviews seriously, being a blockchain project where mistakes can cost millions or more. We use a pull-request model, where each PR must be approved, and we have an always growing set of automated tests. Attention to detail and experience with working on security critical software is a plus. We&#x27;d prefer highly experienced senior people at this point, but we are accepting of anyone with experience in bare metal or assembly development. (Yes, we include open source hobby projects as experience)<p>I&#x27;m the Lead Developer and one of three Co-founders of Qtum, Jordan Earls.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do “expense reports that don’t suck!” (Google “expensify” to read more.) We’re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren’s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it’s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won’t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn’t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We’ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and Uruguay. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We’re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you’re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you’re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you’re this sort of person, you’ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn’t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That’s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it’s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I’m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don’t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com.

There are, by IDC estimates, 4.4 zettabytes, or 4,400,000,000 terabytes, of data in the world today. That number is so big, it’s hard to comprehend. It’s the equivalent of 600 million years of high-definition video, for example. And 90% of that data has been created in just the past two years. Four years from now, experts predict there will be ten times as much -- 44 zettabytes.<p>This explosion of data comes from the 6.4 billion devices connected to the internet, and that number will grow nearly five-fold in the next four years. Some of those devices are computers, of course, handling sales at supermarkets, trading stocks on Wall Street, or reading DNA sequences for researchers at pharmaceutical companies. Some, though, are sensors in elevators, cars, on factory lines and in oil wells. Some are connected to people, tracking temperature and heart rate and more.<p>Computing is so cheap, and networks are so ubiquitous, that it’s possible now to instrument and measure almost anything we care about.<p>Cloudera was founded in 2008 to help businesses capture, store and analyze that data. Half of our original founders are still at the helm. We built a software platform that can handle the huge amounts of data now available. We developed a powerful collection of processing and analytic capabilities. Our customers are able to ask very deep questions of their data, and get their answers quickly.<p>WHY CLOUDERA?\n<i>Cloudera is the largest single contributor to the Apache Hadoop project and we have trained more Hadoop engineers than any other organization on Earth.<p></i>Amazing people - We are a fun &amp; smart team,including many of the top luminaries in Hadoop and related open source communities. We frequently interact with the research community, collaborate with engineers at other top companies &amp; host cutting edge researchers for tech talks.<p><i>Innovative work - Cloudera pushes the frontier of big data &amp; distributed computing, as our track record shows. We work on high-profile open source projects, interacting daily with engineers at other exciting companies, speaking at meet-ups, etc.<p></i>Great culture - Transparent and open meritocracy. Everybody is always thinking of better ways to do things, and coming up with ideas that make a difference. We build our culture to be the best workplace in our careers.<p>*Experience - be part of the exhilarating ride at a fast-growing post-IPO startup<p>Ready to learn more and be a part of an amazing company and career?
