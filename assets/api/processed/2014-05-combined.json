Today, I am 13 and wrapping up my second semester of it, and with an A+, too, thanks largely in part to this site. Sal, I would say you are the best teacher I ever had. Teachers in school just don&#x27;t seem to have the time or, in some cases, even the knowledge to pay as much attention as you do to the actual intuition of the material being taught. How am I supposed to understand a theorem if I don&#x27;t know where it came from, why it works, or even what it really means? Khan Academy also seems to explain everything in a very easy to understand, and even fun, manor. You make calculus almost as easy as simple arithmetic. Anyway, thank you very much.<p>==================================<p>Every month we get hundreds of letters like this from people in all walks of life who&#x27;re thankful for our free, high-quality educational content.\nMost of you reading this are familiar with Sal&#x27;s videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site.<p>You&#x27;ll be part of a small team working alongside both &quot;celebrity&quot; devs (like jQuery creator John Resig and Google&#x27;s first employee Craig Silverstein) and many more who you haven&#x27;t heard of but who are also really awesome.<p>Apply at <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.khanacademy.org&#x2F;careers</a> and be sure to mention that you&#x27;re coming from HN.

We&#x27;re trying to do something legitimately new here, so first, some background: Right now, building a mobile app means:<p>1 (optional): Try to build a crappy version using non-native platform technologies like: HTML5, Titanium, PhoneGap, or some other solution that attempts to use or translate the web way (HTML&#x2F;JS) to mobile.<p>2: Spend a lot of time and money building your mobile app from scratch using native API (Cocoa&#x2F;Android)<p>Apart from the pain induced when you try to do (1) before (2), this is fine if you&#x27;re building a complex or involved app that merits significant and dedicated time and money for development.<p>But, at Propeller, we think there is great demand for the ability to build simple mobile apps (which is why tools for (1) exist.) But, (1) sucks - it&#x27;s not native, or it&#x27;s native translated from web technologies, and becomes unnecessarily complicated. Method (2) works, but it&#x27;s incredibly expensive because everything is being built from scratch.<p>HTML&#x2F;JS was a great idea when shipping code was difficult, and users didn&#x27;t want to install software. Everyone had a runtime already (the browser), and so simple applications were built on that platform.  First just with HTML (the &lt;form&gt; element) and then HTML+JS for clients that were called &quot;rich&quot; but just needed to do things HTML forms couldn&#x27;t do.<p>But taking this model and attempting to make it work on mobile is not only bad engineering, it&#x27;s misguided! This model makes sense when you can&#x27;t ship actual code to your users, but Apple changed all that by inventing[1] the App Store (straightforward) and getting users to trust it (really a big deal.) This removes the distribution problem.  Users will install your software, so you don&#x27;t need to target a legacy distribution stack that was originally designed for sharing documents and a really weird language with so many quirks a book title &quot;The Good Parts&quot; had to be written.  It&#x27;s bad engineering motivated by decisions which aren&#x27;t relevant anymore. Building mobile applications on top of (or translated from) a legacy stack with so many workarounds, shims, libraries on top of libraries, Shadow DOMs, cross-browser compatibility, compile-to-JS, minification, XSS protections, and so on is just crazy.<p>HTML&#x2F;JS on mobile will always suck and will always play catch-up because it&#x27;s built on a legacy foundation. Hell, it sucks on the desktop now too. We put up with it because the alternative isn&#x27;t feasible.<p>&lt;&#x2F;rant&gt;<p>But, there is another way! There are good ideas here.<p>Shipping code (and waiting for Apple to approve it) brings us back to the days when we had to release major versions and burn them to CDs and put them in boxes. It&#x27;s un-agile. Developers love writing web apps because it&#x27;s agile - they can change their application, deploy, and release their fix or feature very quickly. That&#x27;s invaluable and should not be impossible on mobile. [2] So, our hypothesis is that there are a class of simple mobile apps whose behavior can be described declaratively using a simple JSON format that can be hosted statically, or delivered piecemeal as needed, or even generated dynamically a la a REST API. It could describe an app UI directly, and also how it interacts with a server API, and it could be rendered using native controls.<p>Think Web apps, but instead of a legacy stack that wasn&#x27;t designed for application development, a simpler and more straightforward format uniquely suited and designed for modern Internet&#x2F;Web applications, taking into consideration all of the things we&#x27;ve learned a modern Internet application needs.<p>Right now we&#x27;re building (and shipping) sophisticated apps that are defined by our JSON format and rendered using 100% native controls on iOS and Android. We can update that JSON at any time to change the app on next launch. We can send down new JSON via an AJAX-like mechanism.  We&#x27;re iterating on the format&#x2F;protocol, and shipping new version of the client. We&#x27;re figuring stuff out around client-side views, realtime client&lt;-&gt;server communication, data sync in general, and many other interesting things. There are enormous problems to be solved here, both engineering-wise and in API&#x2F;Protocol&#x2F;Architecture design.<p>YOU: are an interested hacker who isn&#x27;t content to let people build shoddy applications on a gross legacy stack, or invest way too much time and money for things that really should be a lot easier. We&#x27;re looking for someone who realizes all these pain points and isn&#x27;t afraid to imagine how things should be done. Think: in 10 years, will people really be building new apps on HTML? No. Come help us design the stack of the future. Ideally, you have experience in iOS and Android, since that&#x27;s our most pressing need right now and likely in the future.<p>US: a 3-person team (two co-founders and myself) trying to modernize (mobile) application development. We run Rails&#x2F;Postgres&#x2F;Sidekiq on the backend for the apps we host for our users, but our clients consume JSON so that&#x27;s an implementation detail. In the future people can generate that JSON using any backend they want. Our iOS application is in Ruby (via RubyMotion, which has worked well for us) and some ObjC, and our Android client is in Java. We share some code between them (like our layout engine) and we want to share more. We&#x27;ve taken a seed round from some great investors[3]. \nWe&#x27;re very small still, so your impact would be immense.<p>EMAIL: jobs@usepropeller.com (I&#x27;m ben@usepropeller.com)<p>1: Yes, I remember Linspire. I&#x27;m using &quot;invent&quot; loosely here.<p>2: Apple doesn&#x27;t let you actually ship code (or, technically speaking, an interpreter, you can ship JS) but many client-side interactions don&#x27;t actually need to be re-implemented every time. HTML forms are an example: client-side interactivity without custom logic. There are many other interactions that can be abstracted this way, especially on mobile, where user interactions are more constrained, and especially for stuff that just updates the UI and can be solved using a Reactive&#x2F;Data Flow approach.<p>3: <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/27/propeller-gets-1-25m-from-a16z-ffangel-everyone-good-basically/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;06&#x2F;27&#x2F;propeller-gets-1-25m-from-a...</a>","time":1398957470,"type":"comment"},{"by":"pwman","id":7682691,"parent":7679431,"text":"Fairfax VA (Washington DC area near metro) local preferred REMOTE possible for the very talented.<p>jobs@lastpass.com<p>LastPass, you know it, you love it, you want to make it better.","time":1398978397,"type":"comment"},{"by":"dmvaldman","id":7680699,"parent":7679431,"text":"famo.us - SF - <a href=\"http://famo.us\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;famo.us</a><p>Jobs page: <a href=\"https://jobs.lever.co/famo.us\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;famo.us</a><p>We are reinventing web apps from first principles.<p>Front-end: if physics, UI, 3D modeling is your thing, give us a look.<p>Back-end: if tooling, performance testing, CI and code releasing, distribution is your thing, give us a look.","time":1398961051,"type":"comment"},{"by":"ashleyjohn","id":7681270,"parent":7679431,"text":"Academia.edu  |  Downtown San Francisco  |  Full Time Engineers  |  Relocation Available<p>Academia.edu is an agile startup located in San Francisco on Kearny and Bush Street.

Our team is also led by CTO Ben Lund who is not only a great technical leader, but also an amazing foosball player.<p>We are well-funded by Khosla Ventures and we are on a mission to Open Science.  Our goal as a company is to build an end-to-end publication system that provides the world with free and accessible academic and scientific papers.  So far we have 9,364,002 users.<p>Feel free to check out the technical projects that our engineers are tackling (see below) or visit our hiring page at <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/hiring\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.academia.edu&#x2F;hiring</a> to learn more about us.  We look forward to hearing from you.<p>We are Hiring a Team to Build a Better Future<p>Here at Academia.edu you will have an opportunity to join an agile team of 9 Engineers who are all making a positive impact on the world by contributing to a movement called Open Science.  As a member of our team you will be given a lot of autonomy to choose projects that interest you the most and the ability to make product decisions with our CTO Ben Lund and CEO Richard Price.<p>We are currently tackling five incredibly difficult product challenges.  Some of these projects have been attempted by larger companies and have failed.  In order to be successful we will need to think way outside-of-the-box and take a leap into the unknown…<p>Peer Review<p>We want to build a peer review platform that allows layers of discussion on top of a single document.  One of the biggest challenges we face is that contextual commenting at a large scale has yet to be achieved.  In order to be successful we need to find original and novel solutions because simple approaches like putting a blog-style comment box at the end of the paper has been tried before and has not been effective.<p>To build Peer Review we must figure out a way to transform all the wide array of styles from any given PDF paper to a clean and consistent format that is embedded for a suitable commenting UI.  We are experimenting to build a rich inline-commenting and discussion interface as well as a reputation system that surfaces quality comments.<p>Interface Design<p>We currently have 7.5 million users who upload their research papers.  Academia converts these PDFs to HTLM5 to display in the browser.  We face the challenges of building web UIs for scientific content such as 3D molecular visualizations and tools for exploring genetic sequences.  We will also build back-end parsers, converters, and storage schemes to enable these UIs.<p>Recommendation Engine<p>We have a news feed that displays recommended papers to our users.  Currently we use a simple rule-based system where papers are tagged by research interests and our users can follow those research interests.  In addition, our users can follow each other.  We want our users to feel as if they are attending an amazing conference where everything we show them is the most relevant and up-to-date information that is available in their field.<p>In order to improve our recommendation engine, we will be immersed in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.  We want to identify which particular field of the paper it correlates to (math, biochemistry, anthropology, etc.) and the type of document (original research, a review article, a conference presentation, a lecture note or some other content).  Using everything from a paper’s previous viewers on Academia.edu to its author and content to its place in the citation graph, we want to determine the relevance of a particular document to a particular user.  Lastly, using large-scale data analysis we want to identify trending papers, highlight influential researchers and help the public uncover important new work more quickly and reliably.<p>Mobile App<p>Academia does not have a mobile app but we are dedicated to building one!<p>Working with a clean slate, we will design and build a mobile API that displays Academia’s core features.  These features will include the user profile, upload papers, news feed, analytic data, and the ability to make comments on papers (Peer Review).  In order to build a dynamic mobile API, we will write easy-to-use client libraries in a wide range of scripting languages that will encourage integration with Academia’s data, content and identity into their apps.<p>Speed, Scale, &amp; Storage<p>Our engineering team will have to build highly scalable systems that effectively store and analyze our entire stream of hits.  We have built an analytics dashboard so that every user can see how many people viewed their profile and how many people have read their uploaded papers.  We enabled this feature by storing structured data in DynamoDB- currently 343 million rows and growing 10% per month.  We want to build features that require more sophisticated aggregations on this data than DynamoDB can provide.<p>Furthermore we will need to figure out how to effectively store massive amounts of data while increasing the speed of our product especially to parts of the world where there is slower internet connections.  This is important because areas in the world with slower connections tend to be where researchers can benefit the most from open access to research.  Our platform must be useable for them too.<p>Future at Academia.edu<p>We have a fun and agile team and we are growing (our site usage grows 10% per month)!  We have the resources to make our mission come true.  We just raised $11 million from Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures.<p>Apply<p>If you think you would be interested in solving some of these technical problems, then please do not hesitate to contact ashley@academia.edu.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that.

Email jobs@frontrowed.com<p>The business\nFront Row makes educational applications for students, teachers and principals that help them make data-driven decisions. As of today, more than a hundred thousand students have signed-up for Front Row and used it to receive custom-tailored guidance in their learning. Thousands of teachers use Front Row every day to save hours of time and make sure their students are growing at the fastest rate achievable. Front Row active users have been growing 100% a month for the past 6 months.<p>Front Row is successfully venture-funded and on the road to profitability.<p>As one of our very first engineers, you will be part of a team of developers who are passionate about their vocation, take pride in their craft and who push each other to grow as professionals. You will strive for pragmatism and 80&#x2F;20 in your work. You will be using tools that provide you with the most leverage and make you most effective. By working really smart, you will produce more than the average developer ever will, but without the crazy hours.<p>We love generalists who can quickly bring themselves up to speed with any technology we’re using: you will have the chance to learn a lot, and fast too. You will receive continuous support and mentorship on your journey to achieving mastery. We do however expect you not to need to be hand-held and rely on others for your own growth. You will have full autonomy over your work.<p>You must not be a drama queen, nor a brilliant jerk: your development chops alone will not cut it. You will work in an effective team that plans, executes and reflects together.\nBecause we’re a small team, everything you create will go into production and be used by hundreds of thousands of students. You will never do unimportant work: every contribution will make a clear and tangible impact on the company’s trajectory. Your personal success will be directly aligned with that of the company.<p>Most importantly, your work will have purpose: Front Row is a mission-driven company that takes pride in making a significant impact in the lives of thousands of students.<p>Tools\nFront Row is a polyglot combination of multiple web applications, mobile apps and asset generation tools. The front-end uses Backbone.js, several plugins and grunt.js for automation. The backend is predominantly made of Clojure-based app talking to PostgreSQL. Our tooling is a mix of Ruby scripts and Haskell apps. Operations relies on Ansible and Vagrant, with AWS for hosting.<p>Nice-to-haves\nYou have worked at a startup before\nYou have worked in small and effective Agile&#x2F;XP teams before\nYou have delivered working software to large numbers of users before\nYou are fluent in functional programming\nYou have a strong understanding of full-stack development, and are comfortable jumping from the front-end back to the DB if need be.<p>Front Row - our mission<p>It&#x27;s a sad reality that students from poorer families perform worse in school than students from wealthier families. Part of this reason has to do with home environment and absentee parents, but much of it has to do with inferior resources and less experienced teachers. The worst part of this problem is that if a student falls behind in any grade, they will forever be behind in every grade. So even if the probability of falling behind in 3rd grade is low (it isn&#x27;t), the probability of falling behind in 3rd grade or 4th grade or 5th grade (and so on) is really high.<p>That&#x27;s the core problem Front Row solves - it doesn&#x27;t let students fall behind. And if they fall behind, it catches them up really quickly. And it does this even if the teacher isn&#x27;t very good (although better teachers always help). Now, the probability of falling behind in any given grade is irrelevant, because it will never compound. The student who would have been the most at risk will instead be up to speed, and therefore far more motivated.<p>Email jobs@frontrowed.com to tell us a bit about yourself if you would like to apply.","time":1398958078,"type":"comment"},{"by":"tom_scrace","id":7680273,"kids":[7680413],"parent":7679431,"text":"London: Farringdon.
