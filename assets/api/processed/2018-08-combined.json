By contrast, Render makes it easy to get up and running quickly but also allows applications to scale and increase in complexity over time, preventing a transition to DIY infrastructure.<p>Our goal is to completely free up developers and teams from managing infrastructure.

The goal here is to produce a set of signals around any given academic paper that indicate how robust the paper’s claims and findings are.<p>It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the academic literature is not reproducible.

Academics have uploaded about 19 million pdfs to Academia.edu. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to robustness, we think the way to build a robustness layer on top of papers is a) to mine the existing graph of citations for commentary and (b) crowd-source commentary&#x2F;peer review from the academic community.<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (b), and a citation graph infrastructure that is the basis of our approach to (a).

Looking for very smart engineers who want to build a unique web app whose end users are in the same room as you.<p>Laws are the operating system on top of which all businesses operate. Without legal infrastructure, businesses and individuals would not be able to transact with trust that their counterparties will be held accountable. This trust has set the stage for a high degree of economic growth in America, and as laws have become more complex over time, interpreting and advising on the law has become an increasingly specialized profession.<p>Along with the law, regulation has also increased as a mechanism to assure the quality of legal professionals. Consequently, a massive legal industry has risen, and navigating the law has become an opaque, slow, and expensive process. Because of the regulatory hurdles in forming startup law firms, competition in providing legal services is soft, and technology and process improvements for clients do not happen as quickly as in other industries. Today, business managers do not have transparency into legal projects, and often view legal as a blocker to the goals they want to accomplish.<p>Atrium’s vision is to democratize and organize enterprises’ access to legal data, legal advice, and legal work. We will achieve this vision by combining the expertise of a full service law firm with the technology development processes and growth ambitions of Silicon Valley. This will enable transparent, fast, and cost competitive legal services for corporations.<p>Atrium has the potential to be a hugely impactful company that brings corporate legal services to the 21st century.","time":1533166602,"type":"comment"},{"by":"cmclaughlin","id":17669370,"parent":17663077,"text":"ShopStyle | Senior DevOps Engineer | San Francisco, CA | Full-time | Onsite | <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shopstyle.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shopstyle.com</a><p>ShopStyle is the world’s leading fashion search engine with the largest offering across 18 million products from more than 1,400 edited brands and retailers across the globe.

Currently, all of this is managed with excel spreadsheets, PDFs, emails, and paper checks.<p>Our software helps lenders, developers, and other stakeholders produce and process this documentation automatically, leading to fewer errors, faster payments, and more profitable loans.<p>We’re currently small (10 employees), YC-backed, and are already working with several of the largest lenders in the industry.

Have had some cool guest speakers in the cybersecurity space, and we send some team members to DEFCON and other security conferences each year to stay on top of new developments.  It’s a fun place to work.  Relocation expenses are available for Senior and DevOps Engineer candidates.   <p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.defensestorm.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.defensestorm.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a><p>Email jobs [at] defensestorm.com to apply.","time":1533150677,"type":"comment"},{"by":"amckenzie","id":17667972,"parent":17663077,"text":"Rescale, Inc. | San Francisco, CA | Onsite | Visa &amp; US Person (See below)<p>Rescale provides the largest, most secure, global HPC footprint seamlessly integrated into an easy-to-use platform built for engineers and scientists.

Led by veteran founders, Knotel creates custom headquarters for companies without any of the headaches. Whether for 20 or 500 people, for 6 months or 6 years, Knotel provides businesses the flexibility and design they need in office space so they can focus on their work.<p>Most companies no longer maintain their own server hardware because AWS offers more flexibility and obviates the need to have hardware on-site and IT folks managing and maintaining uptime. At Knotel we think we can provide something similar for office space -- allowing companies to have the ability to scale up and down like cloud servers and freeing them from the responsibility of managing space by having to find people to take over their long leases, do space build outs, hiring their own with facilities management, etc.<p>As a result, we have a ton of interesting tech challenges all up and down the stack. We are working on a canonical data model for storing all of the information on spaces so we can increase operational efficiency and transparency across the company.

Quickly-growing companies can spend a significant fraction of their engineers&#x27; time interviewing; we help take the load off. We&#x27;ve done a lot to make the interview experience better for all stakeholders that I could write whole essays about, but suffice it to say that candidates love working with us, clients love working with us, and we&#x27;re well-funded and growing quickly as a result.<p>Because of this quickly-growing demand, we&#x27;re looking to hire more Expert Interviewers. The ideal candidate is a software engineer with strong written and verbal English skills with at least a few years of professional experience. Interviewing experience would be great, but we spend 25 hours (paid) training you before you even start, so if you&#x27;re strong technically and love working with people we can usually make it work :) Interviews are conducted over video chat, using a collaborative code editor.<p>Some of our interviewers are freelancers who use our scheduling model to backfill hours; others are full timers at top tech companies looking to make some extra cash; others have quit their jobs to work with us full time; some are digital nomads; one of our interviewers is road tripping around North America for a year and a half, doing anywhere from zero to 40 interviews each week depending on where he is and what the weather&#x27;s like.<p>The application form is here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced64c86?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source=HNWH\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced6...</a><p>I know it&#x27;s a pretty unique job, so if you have any questions reply here or email me at josh@karat.io and I&#x27;m happy to talk through any of it.<p>P.S.

We have a number of exciting opportunities, and therefore need to expand the development team.<p>I am looking for my first developer, reporting directly to me. We are using Python, Django and PostgreSQL on the back-end, Javascript and jQuery on the front-end, all deployed on AWS. As the first developer in a start-up, you will be involved with all aspects of the development process: specification, development, testing, release, support.<p>Ideally, the developer would work core-hours of 10-4.30 (UK time), with a brief stand-up at 10 each day.  I have grown development teams successfully in previous start-ups, but I am still open to ideas for improvements.<p>Interview process consists of: short coding test (should take no more than 1 hour); 30-minute remote interview; 60-minute remote or face-to-face interview, depending on location. I have hired successfully from Hacker News before.<p>We have ambitious plans to grow quickly in an environment where data is sensitive, so any experience of scaling, security and robustness would be helpful. Any experience of start-ups and medical information systems would also be useful, but is not essential.<p>Please apply by sending your C.V. to me, with a short paragraph about why you would be a good fit for the role.
