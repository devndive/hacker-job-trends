Academics have uploaded about 19 million pdfs to Academia.edu. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to robustness, we think the way to build a robustness layer on top of papers is a) to mine the existing graph of citations for commentary and (b) crowd-source commentary&#x2F;peer review from the academic community.<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (b), and a citation graph infrastructure that is the basis of our approach to (a).

It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.

Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that. We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze. We’ve grown fast: after five years, half of all schools in the US (68,000 schools) are using our platform. Our goals are much bigger than that, though.

Once the initial version of the product is built they ship it to a small group of beta testers, gather feedback, and iterate. Once the product has shipped to production, this engineer is then responsible for monitoring the metrics that matter for this product and iterating to improve it. Since we&#x27;re building a product for engineers, we believe in letting our engineers work on things that interest them and giving them ownership over these products.<p>Interview process:<p>Phone Screen -&gt; Technical Homework -&gt; Technical Interviews -&gt; Product Interviews -&gt; Offer!<p>Check out our careers page: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackshare.io&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackshare.io&#x2F;careers</a> Apply via AngelList or email us at careers+HN@stackshare.io - if you&#x27;re emailing us please include your resume and&#x2F;or LinkedIn profile URL!","time":1519955045,"type":"comment"},{"by":"jbarmash","id":16493232,"kids":[16499142],"parent":16492994,"text":"Compass | Many Roles - Sr. Engineers, Product Managers, Marketing &amp; More | New York City | Full-time, Onsite | <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;7k2acn1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;7k2acn1</a><p>Compass is rethinking how real estate should be done; we value strong engineering practices, great user experience and beautiful design.<p>We are 5 years old, $2.2B Valuation ($550M raise Dec ’17), $350M revenue, in 11 major cities; expanding to 9 more.

Quickly-growing companies can spend a significant fraction of their engineers&#x27; time interviewing; we help take the load off. We&#x27;ve done a lot to make the interview experience better for all stakeholders that I could write whole essays about, but suffice it to say that candidates love working with us, clients love working with us, and we&#x27;re well-funded and growing quickly as a result.<p>Because of this quickly-growing demand, we&#x27;re looking to hire more Expert Interviewers. The ideal candidate is a software engineer with strong written and verbal English skills with at least a few years of professional experience. Interviewing experience would be great, but we spend 25 hours (paid) training you before you even start, so if you&#x27;re strong technically and love working with people we can usually make it work :) Interviews are conducted over video chat, using a collaborative code editor.<p>Some of our interviewers are freelancers who use our scheduling model to backfill hours; others are full timers at top tech companies looking to make some extra cash; others have quit their jobs to work with us full time; some are digital nomads; one of our interviewers is road tripping around North America for a year and a half, doing anywhere from zero to 40 interviews each week depending on where he is and what the weather&#x27;s like.<p>The application form is here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced64c86?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source=HNWH\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced6...</a><p>I know it&#x27;s a pretty unique job, so if you have any questions reply here or email me at josh@karat.io and I&#x27;m happy to talk through any of it.<p>P.S.

The phrase that most aptly describes us is “boutique consulting firm” as we are currently working on select software consulting projects and have a long term vision to build a stand-alone product in about 6 months. The future product will focus on enabling business workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future. We&#x27;re looking to get one final person in place to help us build our product, and that is hopefully you.<p>We are incredibly selective (who isn&#x27;t?) and we are really quite small. We&#x27;ve blogged about our hiring process and we&#x27;ve blogged about our funnel. The reality is we&#x27;ve optimized our hiring process to filter first, before a call. We&#x27;re sorry this is the case; it would be really nice to meet everyone, but we simply don&#x27;t have the time to do that while also working on our business. We try to be as transparent as we can be about our process, but if it doesn&#x27;t work for you we&#x27;d love to hear from you when we&#x27;re bigger and having a recruiting division who will be able to do a call first approach. We have a vision of a product but we don&#x27;t have one yet, so we can&#x27;t point you to it. Sorry!<p>Also, we&#x27;re forthright about this (see the first line of this post) but we really and truly only hire employees authorized to work in the US.

You know React, Webpack, CSS, Sass, JSX, and the other standard front-end technologies we don&#x27;t. You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision. You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode. You should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because you know they are doing the same for you.

There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won’t need to.

Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn’t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun.

We’re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start.

If not, then this position isn’t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That’s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it’s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I’m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don’t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that.
