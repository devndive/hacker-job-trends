Sorry, no remote work, but Google does sponsor visas. All levels of experience welcome. We&#x27;ve recently hired an ACM fellow, as well as a new college grad.<p>Of course Google is hiring. So, why I posting this? Every time I tell someone I&#x27;m working at Google in Madison, they&#x27;re shocked that there&#x27;s an office in Madison, and I often hear people complaining about the lack of interesting technical work in Madison. There&#x27;s fun technical work in Madison, I promise.<p>I&#x27;m working on a hardware&#x2F;software co-design project that&#x27;s attacking a fundamentally hard problem, which started as a 20%-time project. There are a couple other hardware projects in the office; most hardware projects start as prototypes of crazy ideas, and go from there. The majority of people here are doing low-level systems programming, usually networking related, and a handful of people are doing data analysis (call it big data, if you like) to figure out how to optimize Google&#x27;s next generation hardware and software platforms. I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t describe projects in much more detail -- Google is pretty secretive about what goes into datacenters.<p>The office is small (just under 30 people), and manages to avoid any bureaucracy you might expect from a big company. The work is interesting enough that in the five year history of the office, only one person has left (and he retired to a ranch in Nebraska). Feel free to email me (see profile) if you have any questions.<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/about/jobs/search/#!t=jo&amp;jid=45087&amp;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;search&#x2F;#!t=jo&amp;jid=45087&amp;</a><p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/about/jobs/search/#!t=jo&amp;jid=2069001&amp;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;search&#x2F;#!t=jo&amp;jid=2069001&amp;</a><p>Edit: Interesting to see this downvoted. If you&#x27;re downvoting this, I&#x27;d be curious to know why. Because Madison is in the middle of nowhere and you don&#x27;t care about Madison? Because you don&#x27;t like big companies? Because you&#x27;re cynically trying to push your job post above this one? Because you think job postings need bullet points?","time":1378043459,"type":"comment"},{"by":"nrp","id":6310835,"kids":[6311426],"parent":6310234,"text":"Oculus VR - <a href=\"http://www.oculusvr.com/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oculusvr.com&#x2F;careers</a> - Irvine, CA<p>Help us bring Virtual Reality back!

Lowest livings costs with highest quality of living.

No need for a car—Berlin has one of the densest subway nets and wide streets make biking fun. In addition, Germany has an amazing social health care system including health, unemployment and pension (when working as an employee).<p>2. A vibrant and fast growing ecosystem of smart people. A vast number of new software talents, founders, software companies and VCs are moving to Berlin, every day (Twitter, Google, Soundcloud, Early Bird and many more).<p>3. People here are open-minded, outgoing, mix well and international—no need to learn German, everyone speaks English! Making new friends is a matter of days. Visit tons of networking and startup events, every week.<p>4. Easy work permissions—Europeans do not need any and can work from day one and the rest applies for the hassle-free Blue Card.<p>5. Berlin&#x27;s night life is unmatched, huge and changing every day (plus ridiculously cheap). Berlin has got some of the most dazzling, naughty, and original clubs on the face of the Earth.<p>Berlin is calling and getting the new tech hub of Europe.

Technologies we use: Cassandra, Storm, Hadoop, MongoDB, Node.js.<p>Our Vision:<p>The Stream. It&#x27;s what matters now. From email to tweets, from forum postings to customer complaints, from enterprise social to automated systems monitors, the drivers for business are now in vortex of voices reflecting markets, internal morale, innovation, brand equity, product acceptance, politics and threats. Rational intend has shifted to irrational actions. Understanding the past bares no guarantee for the future. Understanding what&#x27;s actionable in streams after-the-fact is expensive. Even dangerous.<p>This new paradigm requires new tools and methods that can make sense out of the stream and understand human emotion. Bottlenose’s core technology - StreamSense -  creates a virtual mind map of everything people pay attention to. It is a new kind of database to derive powerful new insights. StreamSense gives organizations the emotional intelligence that they didn’t have before. It allows them to sense what people are feeling and to anticipate the unknown unknowns - both the good and the bad.<p>Attempts at creating machine understanding of our world like the Semantic Web and the Knowledge Graph have failed due to two fundamental flaws: 1) A model of the world is not something that should be derived from documents written by experts; 2) In order to build a ‘global brain’ you need to understand human emotion and human intend.<p>Bottlenose’s ultimate mission is to create a global artificial brain. This global consciousness is build out of a continuous stream of human conversation and attention. By analyzing these vast amounts of data and by analyzing the emotions around it, we build up a mental model of the world. We think this will give us a shot at creating an incredibly powerful Artificial General Intelligence.","time":1378066359,"type":"comment"},{"by":"jv22222","id":6313799,"parent":6310234,"text":"digedu - The digital education company<p>---<p>Remote, Full Time Salary, Must be able to Work in USA Timezone<p>---<p>- UI centric javascript engineer with deep understanding of single page web apps.

IFTTT currently runs on a polyglot mix of technologies, including EC2, Rails, Node.js, MySQL, Redis, Memcached, and Chef.

Our primary product, Moka5 Player, delivers you a VM image of a corporate system that you can run on your own computer (Windows or Mac). You can install whatever software you want, and we automatically split new files into &quot;layers&quot;, so IT can push a new base layer that takes effect as soon as you reboot, and you can press a button and wipe all locally-installed software including IE toolbars and other nonsense, but keep IT-provided software and non-application files like documents. Since it&#x27;s running locally, you can get work done offline (unlike Citrix, VMware View, etc.), and not hate your life if you&#x27;re not on the LAN. We also do a bunch of security work to make it reasonable to run a corporate VM on your personal machine: this way, you&#x27;re not stuck carrying two laptops around.<p>One product that&#x27;s been seeing lots of growth is Moka5 BareMetal, a stripped-down Ubuntu derivative that boots directly into Moka5 Player. By providing our usual management capabilities on an underlying OS you don&#x27;t have to think about, you get the benefits of our product (easier updates, layering, single image, etc.) on corporate-owned hardware. We&#x27;re also writing iOS and Android apps for remotely accessing your files on the go (even when you don&#x27;t have a network connection), and currently getting ready to release a client-side encrypted filesystem for synchronizing your files between your desktop and mobile device. There&#x27;s also quite a bit of work on the server side -- you get to solve fun problems about reliability, scalability, and geographic redundancy, but since we sell a product and not a service, nobody on our team has to carry a pager and get woken up to fix things for customers.<p>We&#x27;re not per se a virtualization company: we don&#x27;t write the hypervisor, since other people already do a great job of that. We do write a lot of things just above and just below the hypervisor layer, and in general a lot of computer systems work. If you enjoy operating systems, file systems, virtualization, or networking, come talk to us. If dynamic-linker trickery sounds like your idea of fun, we&#x27;ll get along well. We work in C++ and C# on the desktop, J2EE on the server, and the native languages (Objective-C and Java) on mobile; there is also a fair amount of open source work to be done in various languages, and we try to be good citizens and work with upstream.<p>See moka5.com for more info, and send me an email (gthomas at that domain name) if you&#x27;re interested!","time":1378059277,"type":"comment"},{"by":"sugnid","id":6321135,"parent":6310234,"text":"Rap Genius (YC S11) - Brooklyn, NY - <a href=\"http://rapgenius.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;rapgenius.com</a> - Help us build the Internet Talmud<p>jobs@rapgenius.com<p>Rap Genius is at an unusual point in our history: we&#x27;re one of the fastest-growing sites on the internet, we get 25MM unique visitors per month, we&#x27;ve raised $15m from Andreesen Horowitz, and yet our tech team is still only six people.<p>What this means is that for anyone who joins us now it&#x27;s a best-of-all-possible-worlds–type situation: you&#x27;ll get to work on something that a ton of people are obsessed with, you&#x27;ll eat a lot of sushi, and yet you&#x27;ll still have the chance to experience the small-team vibe and pick everyone else who works here &#x2F; &quot;define the culture.&quot;<p>WHO WE ARE<p>We&#x27;re a tiny, quick-shipping team.

Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to make publishing a button, and the distribution of scientific ideas instant.<p>- Better peer review. Currently two people peer review a paper, which is too small a sample size. With 50,000 people worldwide in a research community like Machine Learning, or breast cancer, what 2 people think is not statistically significant. We need a broader-based peer review process, one that surfaces the opinions from the entire scientific community.<p>- Data-sets. Scientists don&#x27;t share their data-sets right now. The data remains stuck on their hard-drives. The main reason for this is a lack of incentives for the scientists to share their data. We need to introduce the right reputation mechanisms in science to facilitate the sharing of data. -<p>- Open access.

We&#x27;re an edtech startup with funding some of the biggest names in the valley (Jeff Clavier, Ron Conway, General Catalyst, Mitch Kapor...), and we&#x27;re one of the fastest growing education companies of all time. We&#x27;re the only non-YC company that Paul Graham has ever invested in. We&#x27;ve built a product that makes a real difference and gets huge engagement with millions of kids, and we&#x27;re about to take it to the next level, hopefully with you on board.

The frontend web application talks to this API, and it&#x27;s a single page app that uses our own (soon to be open-sourced) JS framework - mojo.js - which combines the best bits of Backbone, Ember and Angular. That means great templating with powerful and efficient data-binding, but plenty of flexibility to build apps quickly. You&#x27;ll work on this and other awesome tools, and you&#x27;ll build a lot of user-facing features that go out to millions of kids around the world every day.

We&#x27;d like you to be really strong on JavaScript fundamentals, up-to-date with modern JS engineering, and familiar with advanced DOM manipulation.\n* Having said that, some minimal design chops would be cool...\n* ...but not essential. We do have designers.\n* A good sense of product and a desire to have a creative role in designing product features is important to us.\n* You love building things well and building them quickly - like us!<p>The best way to show this off is to point to things you&#x27;ve built.
