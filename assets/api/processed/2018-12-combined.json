BBOXX customers typically use a Pay-As-You-Go payment method, which enables very low income customers access to electricity at home that they would otherwise not be able to afford.

The work will include: Doing direct integrations with banks that offer good APIs; Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us; Adding new features; Optimising for performance; Integrating with government systems; Squashing bugs; Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (maybe using Flutter).<p>Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or polyglots who at least know Ruby.

Four years later their efforts have borne fruit and their predictions validated leading us to double in both revenue and team size over the past two years with a clear plan to double again this coming year.<p>We’re a software company right down to our core with engineers from major tech companies such as Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook as well as engineers from many other excellent software cultures. Beeswax is well funded (RRE and Foundry Group amongst others) and far beyond the ramen hustle stage with benefits and a culture that encourages growth and long-term success. We are funded by leading angels from the ad tech ecosystem, in addition to Foundry Group, RRE, Highland Capital, SV Angels, and Revel Partners<p>We&#x27;re looking for both Sr. and Experienced Engineers to join our backend distributed systems teams which process more than 25 Billion events daily. We&#x27;re fairly tech agnostic in regards to prior experience, however, this role would have you working with a tech stack built in production C++ &amp; Python. Most of our team did not have this experience prior to joining Beeswax.<p>At Beeswax we stand for:\nTransparency: We pride ourselves on providing complete visibility into the successes, and sometimes failures, of our business as we grow and scale. It is an integral part of our culture as we collaborate and work towards a common goal across functions.<p>Control: Control and ownership over individual business impacting projects empowers our employees to think critically and contribute to the development of Beeswax as an industry challenging platform.<p>Flexibility: We empower our employees in a work environment that is conducive to creating the optimal work&#x2F;life balance.<p>website: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.beeswax.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.beeswax.com&#x2F;</a><p>Job Link: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;beeswax&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;683888\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;beeswax&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;683888</a>","time":1543864062,"type":"comment"},{"by":"DripEngineering","id":18603413,"parent":18589702,"text":"Drip (www.Drip.com) - Minneapolis, MN | Salt Lake City, UT |\nFull-Time | ON-SITE<p>We are building the world&#x27;s first &quot;ECRM&quot; and we&#x27;re growing our Minnesota and Utah teams!<p>Current openings in Utah and Minnesota:<p>- Software Developer (Ruby) =&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;drip&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4064249002\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;drip&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4064249002</a><p>- Backend Developer =&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;drip&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4064251002\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;drip&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4064251002</a><p>- Front-End Developer =&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;drip&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4064167002\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;drip&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4064167002</a><p>- DevOps Engineer =&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;drip&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4078007002\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;drip&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4078007002</a><p>- DBA =&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;drip&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4086793002\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;drip&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4086793002</a><p>- Director of DevOps and TechOps =&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;drip&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4086827002\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;drip&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4086827002</a><p>- Director of UI&#x2F;UX =&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;drip&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4078002002\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;drip&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4078002002</a><p>- Platform Engineer - Utah location (Go) =&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;drip&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4084686002\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;drip&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4084686002</a><p>- Platform Lead - Utah location (Go) =&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;drip&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4084681002\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;drip&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4084681002</a><p>- InfoSec Engineer =&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;drip&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4086818002\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;drip&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4086818002</a><p>These are all full-time positions with exceptional benefits!

We strongly believe in a healthy work-life balance, we have 20% time for engineers to work on their own projects, and we have a generous vacation policy. We are primarily looking to staff our NYC&#x2F;LA&#x2F;SF offices BUT we do also have remote positions -- we have a strong remote culture -- available so please reach out to us through Lever even if that is a concern for you.<p>Because we&#x27;re a consultancy we don&#x27;t have one fixed tech stack, but I can tell you about the projects I&#x27;ve worked on. It&#x27;s been a while but the most exotic stack I&#x27;ve worked on was Haskell with Servant, Warp, lenses, all that good stuff. We have several 20% projects using Rust, including one that lets you compose binaural, microtonal music &lt;<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xasopheno&#x2F;WereSoCool&gt;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xasopheno&#x2F;WereSoCool&gt;</a>. We, of course, build tons of React&#x2F;Redux apps for browsers; our favorite new thing in the NYC office is to use yarn workspaces so that the Node.js backend and the React frontend share the same Flow or TypeScript types between them. That way you never have to worry about the data on the wire being malformed. We&#x27;ve also been on more Go, Scala, and Swift&#x2F;iOS projects than you can shake a stick at.<p>Also, fun fact: One of the lesser-known perks of working at a (product-oriented) consultancy like ours is that you rarely have to deal with technical debt. You get to use modern tooling most of the time because you&#x27;re always starting a project from scratch. It&#x27;s great! Tooling-wise we&#x27;re big believers in continuous integration (usually CircleCI) and deployment (also usually CircleCI even though it&#x27;s not always great for that). We use GitHub for everything. Our devops team uses Terraform and AWS, very standard. No surprises! If you love working with top-of-the-line tools, you should check us out.<p>My personal email is hao.lian@originate.com if you want to reach out to me. You can just ask me Haskell questions! Doesn&#x27;t have to be about a job. I work in the NYC office on 10 Crosby St so if you are in NYC we should at the very least grab a coffee.

Nearly 90% of those transactions happen in a real-world store. Data is king and online it powers personalized customer experiences and product recommendations. Offline, however, it’s still 1999. Brands are blind to their customers, causing them to spend more and more money on “spray-and-pray” marketing. The result is an ever-increasing wave of generic spam that makes it hard for consumers to build deeper, data-driven relationships with their favorite brands. No wonder brick-and-mortar stores are being left behind.\nThanx is fundamentally changing that.

I&#x27;m James Nichols, an engineering manager at Plaid. We&#x27;re hiring, and I believe that for the right people, a position at Plaid could be truly transformational. I was a member of Microsoft&#x27;s Bing team back when it was MSN Search (2006!) and was at Airbnb before it was a household name, but I&#x27;ve never been more excited than I am now in my new role at Plaid. I joined Plaid because of the Plaids I met and because of the feeling I had that I had discovered a secret: a really amazing company, well-positioned in an exciting space, that wasn&#x27;t well known among my friends.<p>Interestingly, only my friends in fintech had familiarity. &quot;Plaid? Oh they&#x27;re great!&quot; was a common refrain. As I learned more, I realized that Plaid was actually a major part of some of my favorite apps (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;04&#x2F;meet-the-startup-that-powers-venmo-robinhood-and-other-big-apps.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;04&#x2F;meet-the-startup-that-powers...</a>). Venmo, Robinhood, Lending Club, Coinbase, Acorns, and Plastic all use Plaid&#x27;s APIs to improve the user experience of connecting to the banking system. 2018 has been a big year for Plaid (and the fintech space in general), and the company has huge plans in 2019 to deliver even more consumer value, to expand dramatically, and to do it all while cultivating a company culture (and hiring bar) to be proud of.<p>The vast majority of the company is based in San Francisco, but the newly opened Salt Lake City office has a small, tight team that’s growing fast, led by Kira Booth (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;kira-booth-11aab289&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;kira-booth-11aab289&#x2F;</a>). The SLC office (in the growing tech scene of “Silicon Slopes”) is a short drive from world-class skiing and national parks.  Plaid also has a team of distributed, location-independent, highly successful engineers. The company is doubling down on this, as evidenced by hiring me as their first remote engineering manager. I&#x27;ll be remote myself, and focused on building a world-class work environment for remote engineers who want to be part of a hypergrowth Silicon Valley company but also want to have flexibility in where they work.<p>Does any of this sound good?

Let me know which one of these statements resonates the most:<p>-You&#x27;re excited about the fintech space but would prefer to empower hundreds of consumer applications rather than just a single one.<p>-You want to join a hypergrowth company, especially before everyone else finds out about it.<p>-You care a lot about company culture and the people you work with, but impact is your primary motivation to do great work.<p>-You’re based in Salt Lake City and excited at the prospect of a growing SLC office of a Silicon Valley company.<p>-You&#x27;ve considered becoming a remote engineer, but are worried that you&#x27;ll have to sacrifice career growth, technical challenge, culture, or other important parts of your work environment.<p>-You&#x27;re already a very effective remote engineer and interested in collaborating with a team invested in remote work.","time":1543863589,"type":"comment"},{"by":"l3ver","id":18590884,"parent":18589702,"text":"Lever (YC S12) | San Francisco, CA | Onsite | <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lever.co\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lever.co</a><p>Lever builds modern recruiting software for teams to source, interview, and hire top talent.

OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.<p>Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.","time":1543859210,"type":"comment"},{"by":"rev0lutions","dead":true,"id":18592156,"parent":18589702,"text":"spotify. tho the pay is shit","time":1543865952,"type":"comment"},{"by":"IWeldMelons","dead":true,"id":18601527,"parent":18589702,"text":"&quot;Impactful&quot; sounds so buzzwordy.
