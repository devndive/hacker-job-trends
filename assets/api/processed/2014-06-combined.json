You dig deep and work with customers, the company and our executive team to uncover the ideal way to leverage technology to solve problems. \n* Self-Directed: Once you&#x27;ve got something, we don&#x27;t have to worry about it. You have a bias toward action. Our team doesn&#x27;t have QA, project managers or product managers so we take ownership of what we build. \n* Passion: You love what you do and can share side projects or open source contributions with a GitHub repository, personal project page or blog. \n* Just Generally Awesome: You take your work seriously but not yourself.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else.

Most people are one or the other. All major decisions are made democratically, and we do code reviews on every pull request to keep quality high. You need to be able to express your opinions in as objective a manner as possible, and be able to accept and learn from constructive criticism. There&#x27;s always a better way to do something.<p>Are you working on personal projects &#x2F; your own startup? You&#x27;ll need to be a self-starter to get on at Rainforest, because we&#x27;ll give you a lot of freedom and almost no hand-holding.<p>DESIGNERS WHO CODE<p>Design is at the heart of everything we do. We fundamentally believe that great design - meaning usability, simplicity and elegance - is core to our competitive advantage, and one of the most important ways we can work toward our mission of making developers happier and more productive.<p>We are proponents of noPSD design (so much so that we wrote a blog post about our process). To that end you should at the very least be comfortable with mocking up your designs in HTML and CSS, and ideally be able to own the entire front-end process of shipping a new feature, from conception through user research, to design and build, and iterating based on usage metrics and qualitative feedback.<p>We know we&#x27;re looking for a unicorn, so if you feel like you&#x27;re an excellent front-end hacker whose design chops are a bit rusty you should still get in touch. Design is all about iteration, and we already have a great designer on our team who can help you grow as a designer.<p>DEV OPS<p>We&#x27;re looking for an exceptional DevOps engineer to join as the next member of Rainforest. We&#x27;re still a very small team, but people usually think we&#x27;re much bigger given the scale at which we operate.<p>One of the more technically complex parts of our infrastructure is managing a large stack of virtual machines. Every single test run through Rainforest is done through a newly minted VM. This means that we boot thousands of machines every single day. Given our current growth, we expect this to grow exponentially.<p>Here&#x27;s what we hope to get out of you: You&#x27;re not afraid of writing code, our stack is Ruby, so you&#x27;ll have to either know it or be ready to learn it. You need to have prior experience with a provisioning tool (Puppet, Chef, etc). You understand systems and networks thoroughly. You know things we don&#x27;t about distributed systems.<p>We&#x27;re working on super hard problems that make developers&#x27; lives easier. We are a group of friends that love what we&#x27;re working on, and believe that we&#x27;re going to change the world for people building software.<p>DATA NERD<p>We run a lot of tests here at Rainforest. We record everything that testers do to execute each test. Clicks, text entry, submission times, answers, screenshots… everything. Alongside that, we have fine-grained metrics on our testers, where they are from, what time they log into the system, how often they test with Rainforest. That&#x27;s a lot of data and we could do so much more with it.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone to help us do that.

TrueVault stores healthcare data from mobile health apps, wearable devices and even genomic research so that our customers don’t need to spend their precious time worrying about security, performance and scalability. More than just a database as a service, TrueVault’s proprietary technology allows us to secure our customers&#x27; data better than anyone else can (hint: think encryption and global scale slice distribution).<p>Our mission is to provide the simplest, most secure way for web apps, mobile apps and even wearable devices to store sensitive data.

That&#x27;s why we are looking for incredible people (like you perhaps?) to join us.<p>Who is TrueVault?<p>TrueVault is a Y Combinator graduated startup based in SoMa San Francisco. We have an incredible group of investors including Paul Buchheit, Mark Pincus, and Bill Tai who have invested more than $3 million dollars because they deeply believe in our mission. We are a group of engineers passionate about data security, API performance and building products that developers like us love to use. We are looking for a handful of engineering MacGyvers to join our founding team.<p>Why Join TrueVault?<p>Because at TrueVault, you will have the opportunity to work in arguably the biggest market opportunity of this coming decade, improve the collection, portability and security of really critical data, and push the envelop of data portability forward.

If you want to open source and share what you’ve built with the world at TrueVault you can.  But most importantly, if you want to work with other incredible minds and welcome the challenges of doing things that’ve never been done, then we want you to join us.

We built Sooloos because we wanted its features for ourselves: the ability to browse huge music libraries and stream audio to multiple rooms. We built touchscreen kiosks and put them in our friends&#x27; houses and in our favorite bars. We kept our day jobs, but in our own time we relentlessly pursued the world&#x27;s coolest music listening experience.<p>After a few years, we were surprised that other products in the space were still unable to meet our needs, so we turned our hobby into a company and shipped our first product in 2006. We built our own hardware using studio-grade audio components and packaged Sooloos as a high-end music server for the audiophile market, which received us with open arms.<p>In late 2008 we were acquired by Meridian Audio, which had a culture of innovation in audio hardware and DSP that matched our own in UX and streaming. In addition to manufacturing the gold standard of high-performance multi-zone music solutions, we also develop software music products for Jaguar Land Rover, Hewlett Packard, and a variety of audio OEMs.<p>Five years post acquisition, everyone on our original development team is still with us. Our reference product serves a community of 10,000 specialty users, and we have 10 million activations and 1.5 million monthly actives for HP Connected Music, the product we bundle on nearly 20 million PCs annually. We work with the biggest services in the business including Last.fm, AllMusic Guide, Rhapsody, Deezer, TuneIn, iHeart Radio, Spotify, 7digital, Songkick, Musicbrainz, LyricFind, and Qobuz.<p>Our team is headquartered in Meridian&#x27;s New York office in Soho (home to the most amazing digital theater ever) but we routinely work remotely, sometimes on four continents at once. Our flat structure relies on the initiative and accountability of everyone on the team; we all own projects (and in some cases product) and our output speaks for itself.<p>Please contact hiring@sooloos.com if you&#x27;re interested","time":1401646980,"type":"comment"},{"by":"ricaurte","id":7829834,"parent":7829042,"text":"The Honest Company - Hiring Software Engineers - Santa Monica, CA<p><a href=\"https://www.honest.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.honest.com</a><p>About Us<p>The Honest Company passionately believes in creating not only effective, but also unquestionably safe, eco-friendly, beautiful, convenient, and affordable products for babies and homes.

We’re looking for senior firmware engineers to join the team!<p>The hard requirements are brief: 5+ years of writing code for embedded systems with experience leading projects. At Mindtribe we code most often in C. In addition to technical work, our senior engineers plan projects, lead teams of engineers, and mentor junior members.<p>At this point, you can tackle most technical challenges that come your way. The rest you could figure out given enough time. You’re starting to grow into someone who can elevate an entire team – not just by adding engineering horsepower, but by multiplying the abilities of those around you. You could probably get a job anywhere you want. Why Mindtribe?<p>As a product development consultancy, we get to peek inside a lot of exciting companies. That’s how we know there’s nowhere else we’d rather be.<p>Nobody sees the kind of variety that we do. Working at Mindtribe is being immersed in a constant stream of projects across different industries using different technologies. You will learn. A lot. About everything. Mindtribers are not just versatile within their own fields – “firmware” engineers work with everything from 8-bit micros to embedded Linux to smartphones – we also have EE’s driving SolidWorks, ME’s developing iOS apps, and FW engineers laying out PCB’s. You’ll iterate through many careers-worth of projects and solutions faster than you thought possible. And you’ll get better at it each time.<p>Everyone here loves hardware, so much that we’ve been known to spend leisure time on projects that aren’t so different from what we do at work. Or perhaps it’s the other way around. We may code in bits and bytes, but we work in the real world. Our desks are cluttered with dev boards and prototypes. We work shoulder-to-shoulder with teammates, discuss our work throughout each day, and build amazing things together. We’re constantly in front of clients to extract feedback, plot course corrections, and lead the way.<p>Mindtribe succeeds by putting forward strong teams with sound methods. While we consider ourselves talented engineers, relying on heroic individual efforts to meet impossible deadlines is a painful way to squeak by. Instead, our edge comes from constant introspection about how we do engineering, and we are always looking for ways to improve. Things that are broken here don’t stay that way for long.<p>We’re a small company. As a result, your contributions will have immediate, visible impacts not just on projects, but also on the success of the entire organization. Although we all swab the decks, everyone also gets to help steer.<p>Mindtribe is located in the heart of downtown San Francisco, convenient to public transit and at the epicenter of a flourishing technology industry. We enjoy working together and place great value in maintaining an awesome company environment. ‘Tribers regularly spend time together outside the office, whether that’s doing happy hour at a local watering hole or enjoying the rocking chairs at the new Exploratorium.<p>For more information about us, check out our team (<a href=\"http://www.mindtribe.com/team\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mindtribe.com&#x2F;team</a>), our portfolio (<a href=\"http://www.mindtribe.com/portfolio\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mindtribe.com&#x2F;portfolio</a>), and our method (<a href=\"http://www.mindtribe.com/method\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mindtribe.com&#x2F;method</a>).<p>If this is resonating, we’d love to get to know you!

Thus, our team is a great group of people to work with. It&#x27;s small right now, so we&#x27;re being highly selective about the people we are bringing on board.<p>This company is going to go places. This is my third startup, and I&#x27;ve never seen so much interest in a pre-launch company.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http://we.are.expensify.com/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com&#x2F;apply</a>).
