Factual has venture funding from Andreessen-Horowitz and our partners&#x2F;customers include Facebook, Yelp, Trulia, and Newsweek.<p>There are many challenging problems to work on at all layers of the stack: data cleaning and canonicalization, storage, deduping, serving, APIs, improving data using machine learning, etc. A great example is one of our most recent products, Geopulse Audience, which stands at the intersection of high quality places data and large scale analysis of user geo-data: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factual.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;geopulse-audience\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factual.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;geopulse-audience</a> .

For consumers, earning rewards at their favorite merchants is as easy as paying as usual – gone are the hassles of check-ins, loyalty cards, or any added steps at checkout. Through Thanx, merchants can easily build personal relationships with their best customers – no point-of-sale integration or additional hardware required – taking advantage of automated retention marketing campaigns powered by Thanx. On average, Thanx merchants generate 30% increases in revenue from existing customers and experience drastically improved customer satisfaction. Backed by A-list venture firms Sequoia Capital and SoftTech VC, Thanx powers retention marketing for multi-location merchants across the United States. Over $15B in loyalty rewards were given out last year. Thanx brings a new, measurable and data-driven approach to a massive market that is waiting to be revolutionized.<p>Roles?\nEntry-level sales candidates!

Teachers, parents, and other authority figures didn&#x27;t understand what motivated this behavior, but with the benefit of hindsight I now do.  I wasn&#x27;t breaking things at all, I was exploring them.  I was learning how they worked by taking them apart and seeing them laid bare.  Sometimes, I&#x27;d manage to put them back together and occasionally they&#x27;d even work!<p>Once, when I was about twelve or thirteen, I took apart a mechanical bedside alarm clock, laid all the gears out organized by size and was promptly grounded for &#x27;destroying&#x27; it.  While serving my punishment, I went to work re-assembling it, with one small change.  What had previously been a cheap cardboard clock face was replaced with a piece of translucent contact-paper, with numbers careful stenciled in their proper places.  I loved that clock.  Every morning I&#x27;d wake up, see it, and glance deep into its inner workings.  That visual reminder that I&#x27;d been curious and unlocked its secrets was how I started mornings throughout my formative years.<p>Somewhere along the line, I lost track of where that clock ended up.  It may be gone, but the spirit it demonstrates remains one of my strongest motivators.  I&#x27;ve found no better outlet for this drive to understand the inner workings of things than software security assessment.<p>At Matasano, we treat our client&#x27;s applications like I did that clock.  We take them apart, examine them piece by piece, and arrive at an understanding of what makes them tick.  Only after arriving at this can we find and exploit vulnerabilities.  We slap a clear face on those applications, with the numbers carefully identifying any discovered flaws.  We take them apart and &#x27;break&#x27; them, not to be destructive, but to be constructive through understanding them.  Thankfully, we don&#x27;t even end up grounded. :)<p>There&#x27;s no area of computing that draws on as many skills, but programming, debugging, protocol analysis, reverse engineering, systems administration, network engineering and cryptographic analysis  aren&#x27;t what make great AppSec consultants.  You need to find what motivates you. For me, being tasked with quickly developing a deep understanding of unfamiliar applications plays right into the mindset that led me to explore that clock.<p>So, again I&#x27;ll ask, what excites you?<p>Learn about our hiring process at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.matasano.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.matasano.com&#x2F;careers</a> or contact us at careers@matasano.com<p>Get a taste for some of what we do at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microcorruption.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microcorruption.com</a> and <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cryptopals.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cryptopals.com</a><p>Check out our blog at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;chargen.matasano.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;chargen.matasano.com</a><p>~<i>-,._.,-</i>~&#x27;`^`&#x27;~<i>-,._.,-</i>~&#x27;`^`&#x27;~<i>-,._.,-</i>~&#x27;`^`&#x27;~<i>-,._.,-</i>~&#x27;`^`&#x27;~<i>-,._.,-</i>~","time":1427898615,"type":"comment"},{"by":"nhm","id":9307945,"parent":9303396,"text":"Revert is hiring in Auckland, NZ: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;revert.io&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;revert.io&#x2F;careers</a>\nLooking for a Senior&#x2F;Intermediate Ruby dev, ElasticSearch and&#x2F;or &quot;Big Data&quot; experience is a bonus.\nAlso a graduate position, designer, and sales rep.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We just went to Portugal...where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that.

We have roughly 4,000 R&amp;D employees, so work is very diverse across the company. Teams are roughly 4-8 people at the lowest level and group up into larger organizations organized by product type (equities, fixed income, etc.). I happen to work on infrastructure for the Professional service (aka Terminal). Our team has very little interaction with anything finance related and most of our work is related to evolving the entire platform forward and making forward-looking changes. Back in 2005, we converted all of our higher-level &quot;app&quot; development to server-side JS (custom, Spidermonkey based) and now run probably the largest server-side JS stack in the world. We migrated a lot of our GUI toolkit to be scripted as well (LUA this time) to allow us to more easily evolve it. And now we&#x27;re evolving it, embedding Blink and pushing bugfixes and feature enhancements to do what we need (our fork is on GH). We abstracted away our next-gen server-side infrastructure from specific JS engines and can now run it on top of Spidermonkey or V8 (or any other engine with a similar API) as we please. We&#x27;re helping define and implement CSS3 Grid spec and help implement ES6 generators&#x2F;arrow functions among other things. We built and run a third-party app store within the Terminal. Over the past decade we&#x27;ve rebuilt the C++ foundation of the company from the ground up, starting with our own STL implementation using the Lakos allocator model (Lakos and a few other C++ committee members work here). We have a huge wealth of awesome C++ libraries that we started open-sourcing and will continue to add more layers as time goes by. (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bloomberg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bloomberg</a>)<p>All of what I mentioned above is stuff done by the infrastructure team, and we&#x27;re a tiny percentage of the overall R&amp;D population. Other teams get to do fun stuff as well. The mortgage team ported long-running ABS OAS calculations from Linux farms to GPU clusters and wrote a Python based cash flow engine from the ground up, potentially helping define the SEC&#x27;s Python-files-must-be-included rules.<p>We run a worldwide network with somewhere around 35,000 circuits in 180+ countries. We ingest anywhere from 45-60 billion &quot;ticks&quot; daily aggregate from feeds in all of these countries. We normalize, scrub, and then re-distribute all this data to customers in all of those countries in an efficient manner. The Terminal provides analytic and visualization tools to work with market data, as well as the same tools to work with news and alerts. On the news side, we ingest over 100,000 news feeds (e.g. WSJ would be one &quot;feed&quot;) from around the world and do the same kind of processing, applying ML for sentiment and topic classification, etc. We also design our own hardware in-house -- everything from keyboards and monitors, to custom ASICs for authentication&#x2F;subscription tokens. The web side (bloomberg.com, businessweek.com) are now Node based and the framework used to build them was also recently released on GitHub.<p>Oh, and we have a TV station, radio station, etc. They innovate too. Bloomberg TV was the first non-OTA channel to be distributed via Aereo, for instance.
