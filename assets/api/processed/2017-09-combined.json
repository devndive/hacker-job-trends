It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after five years, half of all schools in the US (68,000 schools) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of just over 100 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Golang, Node and React.

That was like in a single quarter all based on stuff I wanted to try to accomplish.

We&#x27;re helping people do things like this, data science, IoT, games and more. We want to help people do this in Clouds like AWS, Google and Azure... but having datacenter and bare metal support helps!<p>What&#x27;s life like? You&#x27;ll get to write apps, blog, build videos and work with community members. You&#x27;ll help with the marketing team regarding how the technology of MongoDB and the products our engineering team can help developers. You will attend and speak at events. You&#x27;ll even get a chance to work on product launches when updates or brand new products are released.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do “expense reports that don’t suck!” (Google “expensify” to read more.) We’re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren’s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it’s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won’t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn’t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We’ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Mexico, Turkey, Croatia, and Portugal. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We’re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you’re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you’re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out.<p>If you’re this sort of person, you’ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn’t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That’s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it’s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I’m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don’t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application (which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com.

Personalized medicine depends upon accurately finding and interpreting our genetic differences. While technological advances have revolutionized our ability to find these differences, genetic tests often fail to interpret these differences, leading to inconclusive results and clinical uncertainty. This is both a limitation of existing data and approaches. Jungla’s strategy unites experts in functional genomics, computational biophysics, and machine learning to develop proprietary solutions for genetic interpretation. The guiding principles at Jungla are rooted in knowledge generation, performance, scalability, and transparency. Our team strives to make genetic tests more useful, faster, and less expensive.<p>What You&#x27;ll Do: Help patients better leverage their genomic information across a wide-array of genetic and genomic tests. To achieve this, you will develop new models and systems that learn from diverse and increasingly complex computational and experimental data types. Help establish and promote a culture of engineering excellence.<p>Ownership and Direction: Alongside the cofounders –3 ex-Stanford PhDs and postdocs– you will be instrumental to both problem definition and solution development.<p>Engineering Excellence: You will set the software engineering tone for our small team, establishing continuous integration practices in an agile environment.<p>Technical Development: You will drive architecture, algorithms development and implementation of critical components of Jungla’s ambitious technical roadmap. Improve Healthcare: You will utilize your skills to help develop solutions that will impact patients’ lives.<p>Let&#x27;s Talk If: You know deep learning: You have a thorough grasp of machine learning fundamentals and significant experience building deep learning solutions to various challenging problems. Preferably using the Python data stack with tensor-based programming languages with a focus on deep learning: Tensorflow (preferred), (py)Torch, Caffe, Theano, etc.<p>You are passionate about driving insights from data: You have high-fluency and the equivalent skills of 3+ years of experience in: statistics, machine learning, coding, and answering questions in high-dimensional numerical datasets. Our data is different from established areas of ML&#x2F;DL application (like computer vision or natural language processing), so you’ll need to derive effective hyperparameters and architectures for different learning problems and data types.<p>You care about code: You take pride in development and have a deep understanding of how to write high quality, maintainable, extensible software. You have built tools in a production software engineering environment, including use of automated regression testing, version control, and deployment systems.<p>You own your work: You’re a steward of excellence who can identify, prioritize, manage and execute goals that impact the team’s mission.<p>Why You&#x27;ll Love Working at Jungla: We combine competitive compensation and benefits with the opportunity to work on challenging and worthwhile problems. You will work with an interdisciplinary team at the interface of computer science, biophysics, and genomics, developing elegant technological solutions to improve patient care.<p>We believe that mission-driven teams with diverse skill sets are best positioned to drive impact.
