Traditional banks, saddled with new rules and regulation, are no longer in the business of taking risk and making loans and cannot be relied on to deliver credit access and opportunity to the masses. Instead, tomorrow’s lenders will be media companies, retailers and prominent brands that have deep relationships with their customers and want to step in to help their customers get a fair loan. But, to do it right, they need scoring, servicing, technology and capital — all of which are expensive and difficult to build. So, why build it if you don’t have to? This is the future of lending.

You&#x27;ll be working directly with the CEO and management team, and they&#x27;re very pleasant to work with as a developer (they communicate well, they have reasonable expectations, and you&#x27;ll have pretty much full autonomy regarding coding decisions). The pay is great, and the office is downtown. You get your own office, parking is included, and everyone at the company is great to work with. The company is also super generous with vacation time—we get about a month of paid time off around the end-of-year holidays, in addition to the regular vacation benefits and paid time off on market holidays.<p>It would be awesome if the person taking over my job also has decent desktop support and network skills, but if not we need a freelancer or IT support company who can be on call for that kind of stuff.

We believe that chat is a great communication medium but it&#x27;s underused for communication between companies and their customers. Especially B2B companies nearly exclusively use phone and email, and this is simply because there have been no good chat-based solutions to fill this gap. Klets fixes this. We launched a month ago and are seeing impressive traction and adoption.<p>We&#x27;re looking for an intern who wants to make our existing <i>and potential</i> customers extremely happy. Your role will be very flexible and very much open to your own wishes and (study) needs. It&#x27;s a plus if you have a clue about online marketing and can write (blog) well. You&#x27;ll be studying something related to marketing, business or communication right now, and we&#x27;ll tune the opening to match your studies. The fact that you, a non-programmer, are looking on Hacker News for internships gives you an immediate edge.<p>Most of our customer support (obviously) goes over chat, so it&#x27;s important that you enjoy chat and text messaging. We find that customer support via Klets makes complete strangers have fun and crack jokes with you, so it&#x27;s certainly a fun job. We&#x27;d also love for you to contribute to our marketing strategy if that&#x27;s up your alley - content marketing, growth hacks - anything you can think of, really.<p>We&#x27;d like you to live relatively nearby but we&#x27;re open to a big part of your work to take place remotely if necessary.

The sales process is undergoing fundamental changes because prospects&#x2F;buyers have immediate online access to all aspects of a Company’s products, positioning, reputation, and in many cases pricing.  Many new products and platforms have been created to help sales organizations with these changes but sales reps and sales managers lack a compelling, easy to use, interface to organize, visualize, and share data about their prospects and sales performance.<p>Solution:  We are building a Relationship Intelligence platform that automatically interfaces and integrates with all backend sales systems and tools (CRM, Email, Calendar, Social, etc).

We know that the laundry list of super competitive pay, stock, snacks in the kitchen, and appreciation for a job well done are baseline requirements, so we go way beyond.

We’re also improving the speed and reliability of our infrastructure, and trying new technologies to keep current (e.g. Swift and React).<p>We looking for four main strengths in you:<p>◦ <i>skill:</i> your colleagues would say you get things done. You work to a high standard, and know about and apply appropriate best practices in your work. You are at home with improving and extending existing code as well as new development.<p>◦ <i>desire to learn:</i> despite (or perhaps because of) you being good at what you do, you want to get better. You seek out best practices, new ideas, honest feedback, and unknown areas of code, in order to know more and work better.<p>◦ <i>understanding:</i> our product team is great but not infallible. You’ll be happy to challenge and clarify product decisions with our users’ best interests at heart. Similarly, our QA team is meticulous but not your babysitter. You’ll be handing something polished to QA, not throwing the first thing that compiles over the wall. Overall, everyone at Firefly shares responsibility for the product making sense and being of high quality.<p>◦ <i>clear communication:</i> We have a lightweight process, so most days, other than a morning standup meeting to share what’s going on and what’s planned, you’ll be responsible for your time. This also means that, when there are issues, you need to inform the right people, explain what’s going wrong, and help get things resolved and moving forward again.<p>Speaking of process, we have a design team who handle HTML and CSS, a product and UX team who produce clear specifications, a QA team to help us build things well, and a two-week sprint cycle for getting things done. Other than that, we’re pretty small-a agile and are happy to try things out to see what helps.<p>In terms of experience, we need you to be comfortable with iOS or a web platform. Our server-side code is written in C# and our web front end has some Javascript, so you’ll need to know these or be able to pick them up. We work as generalists, so experience of any of the following would be a positive: Android, Windows Phone, shell scripting, infrastructure automation, databases, particularly SQL Server, building API integrations.<p>We offer competitive salaries dependent on experience, a generous bonus scheme, flexible training budget, brown bag talks and a Kaizen day for self-improvement and experimentation every fortnight.<p>So, if you’ve got an interest in education and a desire to learn your craft alongside others making the same journey, we want to hear from you.

WK leverages the hottest trends (daily deals) in popular culture and marries them with wine.  Think Kayak for travel meets wine.  And the timing is perfect.  Why?  Wine Kloud is part of an industry segment that tends to be behind the tech curve as compared to its target audience – wine drinkers!  We are not only prepared to change the way an industry operates, but set to change the way millions of consumers buy wine.  That is powerful and the CTO will be an integral part that makes it all happen.<p>WK has not launched yet, but will be live in a couple of weeks.  The initial buildout was outsourced to a development firm.  We have secured funding and will be happy to disclose all of that information to serious and interested candidates.<p>_____<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION&#x2F;REQUIREMENTS:<p>We are in search of a team member, not a rogue.  We are collaborators, not dictators.  Sounds cliché, but very true.  We want to foster an environment in which we all have valuable input and can work positively and effectively toward the common goals of the company.  To be clear, the individual we hire will have full direction over the tech strategy, but that strategy will be designed and created as a result of the management goals, which this person will help establish.<p>We need someone who can innovate, plan, build, implement, and drive all of the company’s tech initiatives, including coding.  While we have plans to build out a team underneath this person in the very near future, in the beginning, they will have to roll up their sleeves and code.  This is not a country club position in which they delegate.  This is a startup.  This individual will also be responsible for maintaining all aspects of our software, from debugging to taking preventative measures to ensure uptime.<p>This person’s actions will directly shape the company.  Their stamp will be all over Wine Kloud.  This is a big role and requires someone with the experience and acumen to fill it.  We need someone who is passionate about building and problem solving.  Someone who can contribute to and incorporate the company vision.  Someone entrepreneurial in nature with the ability to lead and, ideally, successful startup experience.  And possibly most important, someone who is committed to the success of the organization.  We are not looking for a year-long commitment from someone.  We need someone onboard who will see out the company’s success.<p>_____<p>TECH PROFILE:<p>Here’s the tech stack that our developers are working with.  The ideal hire will know these well:<p>- Python<p>- Django<p>- MySQL<p>- Redis<p>- Celery<p>- Stream Framework<p>- Python Social Auth<p>- Apache<p>- 3rd Party Services like Payment Gateways<p>_____<p>Please submit your resume or address questions to info@winekloud.com.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines. We are going to Cambodia this fall...want to join us?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that.

Organizations struggle just to store it all, let alone make sense of it. Enigma helps organizations and individuals fuse, organize, and explore data to make smarter decisions.​​\nAt Enigma, we started from the realization that there is an enormous quantity of hidden knowledge locked away in data silos and obscure formats, just waiting to be released. We are building data discovery and analytics tools that make it simple for organizations to liberate their own private data, and for the wider community to explore and build upon Enigma’s own integrated public data platform. We believe data can reveal tremendous things about the world and that it will continue to transform it in the years and decades to come.<p>We&#x27;re in total  growth mode, just raised our Series B and looking to build our Engineering team.
