It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after five years, half of all schools in the US (68,000 schools) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of just over 100 (~40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Golang, Node and React.

We mean it.<p>We value aptitude over alma mater, empathy over a list of APIs. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether your resumé says PHP or PhD: if you&#x27;re smart, empathetic and know some stuff, we want to work with you.<p>We have many offices worldwide including SF, NYC, Toronto, London, Palo Alto (pivotal.io&#x2F;locations) and more coming. We&#x27;re broken into three main divisions: Pivotal Labs (<i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Cloud R&amp;D and Big Data.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i> helps clients to become better at product development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. We pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud R&amp;D</i> is where we build the best cloud platform available: We&#x27;re the majority contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. Our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i> and it&#x27;s <i>still</i> zooming up and to the right.<p>Except for upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial cloud (Pivotal Web Services).<p>Cloud R&amp;D is also responsible for Pivotal Tracker and Spring.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is our suite of battled-hardened products, now open sourced. Greenplum tackles massive datasets with the comfort of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, donated as Apache Geode, is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, excellent benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong isn&#x27;t mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The NYC beer fridge has more IPAs than I prefer but I guess that&#x27;s life in paradise.<p>-- <i>Applying</i><p>To see open jobs, go to pivotal.io&#x2F;careers.

Our platform creates new possibilities for collaboration and mobilization that is meeting a real need for the progressive movement. We are a small team that is growing rapidly, and we are expanding our technology significantly.<p>You are an excellent frontend&#x2F;javascript developer or engineer, well-versed in today’s rapidly changing frontend and javascript landscape. You are experienced working with a small, dedicated team of product managers, designers, and backend engineers to build web-driven software, especially SaaS offerings. You know how to make hard choices, balancing perfectionism when it&#x27;s possible with just getting it done when you have to so you can ship on time and on budget. You think outside the box to find solutions and thrive on both collaborative and independent problem solving. You are independent and ready to own a product’s frontend implementation from start to finish. And you are looking for a job where ideals are matched by a solid business that is growing rapidly and making a difference in the world.<p>You&#x27;d be joining a small, flexible, largely remote team with a lot of autonomy and the chance to make foundational tech choices, rather than dealing with legacy systems, with the potential to ship products that immediately impact the world.

We are accepting applications on a rolling basis and hope to onboard these new roles before this year’s state legislative elections in November. See more information about flippable below.<p>We care deeply about building an inclusive, equitable, and nationally representative team -- and thus designing our hiring process to minimize bias. We are using principles from Project Include and are actively recruiting individuals who share our passion for good government but may not yet have heard of us.<p><i></i>\nOur democracy is upside down. We see partisan imbalance at all levels of government -- but especially in our states. Over the past 10 years, the GOP invested heavily in winning state elections in order to take control of national elections. They passed laws suppressing voters and redrawing district lines to give themselves a permanent majority in Congress. And if we don’t take action at the state level, our system will continue to favor Republicans through 2030.<p>But we can flip the script -- starting in the states. By flipping state legislatures from red to blue, we can draw new Congressional maps and protect voting rights, giving everyone an equal voice in our democracy. We can enact progressive policies that protect our civil rights and expand the social safety net. And we can build a Democratic bench, ensuring strong state and federal leadership for decades to come.<p>Flippable is building a national movement to flip states from red to blue. We empower voters, volunteers, and donors with information that both educates and motivates them to support Democrats at the state level. Our primary activities are:<p>Raising awareness: We produce original digital content that highlights the critical role of state governments in a balanced democracy. Our content is viewed over 10M times per month.<p>Running the numbers: We are building a model to identify which Democratic candidates donors should invest in -- where their dollars and time will have the greatest ROI. Our analysis shows where we are most likely to flip seats and, ultimately, the state chambers that have the greatest impact on redistricting and voting rights.<p>Supporting candidates: We show our community the highest-impact ways to get involved through clear, tangible calls to action. Since November 2016, we have raised $450,000 and deployed thousands of volunteers to support Democrats running in the most critical -- and flippable -- races.","time":1502228575,"type":"comment"},{"by":"tonyleask","id":14906442,"kids":[14929557],"parent":14901313,"text":"Dictionary.com | Multiple Developer Openings | Oakland, CA &amp; Los Angeles, CA | ONSITE, FTE, VISA, SALARY:DOE, <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dictionary.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dictionary.com</a><p>Do you love to build and launch products at consumer scale?

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do “expense reports that don’t suck!” (Google “expensify” to read more.) We’re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren’s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:\n- An incredibly hard worker, even when it’s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won’t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.\n- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn’t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We’ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?\n- Super talented, in a general way. We’re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you’re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.\n- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you’re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you’re this sort of person, you’ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn’t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That’s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it’s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I’m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don’t accidentally overlook you?\nThere are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com.
