Full time and summer internships.<p>I work at MIT Lincoln Laboratory (<a href=\"http://www.ll.mit.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ll.mit.edu</a>), a research and development center run by MIT that does work for the government. My group has about 20 people in it and does application security and reverse engineering. Knowledge of things like assembly, operating systems, and systems are pluses but not required. It's great if you have some experience in those things, but if you can code I want to talk to you. The pluses:<p>* Awesome workplace culture. We're a 9-5 shop, you pick your laptop, and you can order any books that you need.<p>* We provide a lot of training. We send you to conferences, including Blackhat and Defcon. We also reimburse tuition at MIT. Last semester my office mate took operating systems with Robert Morris.<p>* We sponsor relocation and have multiple positions we want to fill immediately.<p>You do need to be a US citizen and you will have to get a security clearance. I'm happy to talk to you about how the clearance process works and answer any questions you have! If you're local I'll buy you a cup of coffee while we talk it over. You really can't waste my time.<p>Email: tsally@mit.edu","time":1314897314,"type":"comment"}
