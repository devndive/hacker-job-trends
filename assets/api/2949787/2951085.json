The company is <i>very</i> technology driven, creativity is encouraged, and while we are very robust and careful in our practices and procedures, (especially operations and release management) I feel like  developers and managers are given a lot of independence to make important technical decisions, which leads to giving us the ability to really make a difference with every thing we do. That's something special to have in a company of this size, IMO.<p>So, the careers page is here: <a href=\"http://www.akamai.com/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.akamai.com/careers</a><p>I know my group is looking for skilled SQA engineers, but company-wide we need everything from battle-hardened linux admins to C++ gurus, to Java/Perl/Python hackers and everything in between. My own group develops in Clojure. My co-worker is currently prototyping algorithms in Haskell.<p>Since I do get a referral bonus, don't forget to send them my name if you submit a resume!<p><pre><code>  (bash -c 'echo moc\\!iam@k@ diff@css | tr \" @!\" \"@a.\" | rev')</code></pre>","time":1314900223,"type":"comment"}
