Our cellmaps product line has been used to build interactive coverage maps for carriers and an in-browser spatial analysis tool for comparing primarily wireless and cable datasets. We're a small company with a small engineering team but we're dealing with engineering at scale as our infrastructure is rendering and pushing out millions of map tiles a day.<p>Our business and products are growing rapidly and we're looking for someone with significant software engineering experience to come in as a mentor in the position of director of software development. You'll be a major player during our shift from a data company to a software company.<p>Some technologies we use that you may find interesting: aws,  node.js, solr, mongodb, javascript, ruby, c, rails, chef, and others.<p>Email us at hr@americanroamer.com if you're interested.","time":1314886500,"type":"comment"}
