We're a text understanding research and consulting company, spun out from the MIT Media Lab.<p>Businesses accumulate large piles of disorganized text, from social media, surveys, knowledge bases, and customer feedback, and they want a computer system to quickly tell them what's in that text so they can make business decisions. We do that, with natural language processing tools that scan text for known meanings while learning new ones.<p>We work with open source projects. We use NLTK and NumPy a lot. We're in a nice co-working space with a mindblowing view of the Boston waterfront.<p>Send your resume to hiring@lumino.so. We also encourage you to send us a link to your GitHub, Bitbucket, or wherever you collaborate on code.","time":1314952103,"type":"comment"}
