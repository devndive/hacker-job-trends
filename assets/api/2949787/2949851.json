We're funded and ready to start scaling up our team.<p>Looking for .NET, Android and iOS developers.<p>If you want to work on a site that deals with a ridiculous volume of data generated by over 300,000 <i>concurrent</i> people playing the games we track (and that number's going to get a lot bigger this year!) then you're going to love this.  We're using tons of C#, SQL Server, and a growing amount of MongoDB, and I'm open to using what you're best at if it works.<p>Android and iOS devs will be maintaining, further developing and supporting our APIs for those platforms, and should have completed a game or two.  If you love making games you'll love working on Playtomic because it won't interfere too much.<p>ben at playtomic.com","time":1314882769,"type":"comment"}
