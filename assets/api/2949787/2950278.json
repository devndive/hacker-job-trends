We've had great luck hiring programming interns from HN and have already hired a social media/marketing intern. We could use a Public Relations intern too.<p>Here's the job description for the marketing intern that we already filled... We haven't written a PR intern description yet but it would be similar, but with more Public Relationsy stuff.\n<a href=\"http://feefighters.com/jobs/kickass-marketing-intern/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://feefighters.com/jobs/kickass-marketing-intern/</a><p>Press is a big part of what we do, for driving traffic to the site and SEO purposes. We have been able to get great press on our own (<a href=\"http://feefighters.com/press\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://feefighters.com/press</a>) and fired 2 different PR firms we were working with. Another aspect of PR is figuring out where we should be on the internet - responding in forums etc. Drop me a line if you're interested- email is in my profile.","time":1314889369,"type":"comment"}
