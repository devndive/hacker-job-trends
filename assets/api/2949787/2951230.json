Full time and internships.<p>QLabs<p>We're a new type of in-house incubator: we prototype startups by building and launching an MVP every 6-8 weeks.<p>This is like startup boot-camp. Come hack with us on amazing projects, learn everything there is to know about building and launching products and starting companies, all without the painful early-startup salary.<p>One of our upcoming field trips is an all-day visit to MIT's Media Lab.<p>The lab started in February of this year, and now has five awesome developers (hailing from Columbia, ITP, NYC Resistor, and more). We're looking to fill positions #6 and #7.<p>Show us your projects: we love to see an entrepreneurial streak and a diversity of experience.<p>Our one steadfast requirement is that we definitely need you to know Rails.<p>Email me at rw@rwinslow.com if this appeals to you!","time":1314902565,"type":"comment"}
