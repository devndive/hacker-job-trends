We teach the concepts behind the code, then help students build projects until everything clicks. We get results -- we&#x27;ve had students get jobs at companies like SpaceX, and our NPS is around 60.<p>We don&#x27;t believe in skimming the surface of concepts so that students just know what to type. We build intuition around complicated ideas like random forests from the ground up. We walk students through building their own algorithms, so we can help them understand the tradeoffs and limitations of techniques. We help students build projects, so they can solidify their knowledge and get real-world experience.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone to help us extend and enhance our curriculum. This involves writing instructional content, creating projects, thinking about how to improve how we teach, mentoring students directly, and getting feedback from students to improve our teaching methods.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone who&#x27;s passionate about teaching, and shares our mission to give people access to high quality education at a low cost. You&#x27;ll have a lot of latitude to shape how we teach, and to help build a personalized educational platform. We&#x27;re bootstrapped and profitable, so this is also a chance to learn more about the business side.<p>This is a great role if you want a make huge impact on the world, grow a business, and rapidly expand your skillset.<p>If this is interesting, please email srini at dataquest.io.","time":1496422461,"type":"comment"}
