We use modern communication methods (like email!), machine learning and a less abrasive touch than traditional collection agencies.<p>The company is growing rapidly and our technology infrastructure needs to grow with it. We&#x27;re looking for an SRE to help scale our AWS-based infrastructure, ensure relability, update our tooling and make sure we can support the growing needs of the business. There are many projects in the future to help keep us ahead (if that&#x27;s possible :-) ) of the growth curves, more so than our DevOps group of one can currently handle.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trueaccord.breezy.hr&#x2F;p&#x2F;6429473b2fee-site-reliability-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trueaccord.breezy.hr&#x2F;p&#x2F;6429473b2fee-site-reliability...</a>","time":1496340995,"type":"comment"}
