We&#x27;re 100% remote.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a frontend to help design and build the next generation of tools for displaying and managing data. You&#x27;ll also help migrate our backbone framework to a modern component-based approach (Vue&#x2F;React).<p>Knack is a no-code application platform that enables anyone to easily build business and workflow apps. It&#x27;s a big fun product that creates tons of value.<p>Other things about us: we&#x27;re 100% bootstrapped, so we know how to build a product customers will pay for. We believe in growth without compromise, not growth at all costs. We don&#x27;t have a VP layer or management, and want to keep it that way as long as we can.<p>Other things about you: you want to join a team that actually enjoys working with each other.

You want to maximize your impact.<p>Find out more at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knack.com&#x2F;work-at-knack\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knack.com&#x2F;work-at-knack</a>","time":1496366131,"type":"comment"}
