I&#x27;m at a major astronomy project to build a telescope that can observe the whole sky twice a week (lsst.org). Our Education and Public Outreach folks down the hallway from me are planning a bunch of cool projects for the general public, kids, and citizen scientists and need someone to come up with how it could all be done using current technology stacks.<p>So! You get to be one of the first people to learn about the earth-killing asteroid <i>and</i> you get to work on something that your annoying uncle can understand when you go home for Christmas and he asks &quot;So what do you do all day with that computer?&quot;<p>This is a technical leadership position and as the team is still ramping up it <i>has</i> to be on-site, but Tucson is a great town to live in (they don&#x27;t call us &quot;The Portland of the SouthWest&quot; for nuthin&#x27;) and you can buy a house for what it takes you to rent a closet in SV :-) If you need a visa that is fine, we&#x27;re a quasi-academic shop and our HR is used to this kind of thing.<p>Don&#x27;t let the incredibly sucky job application site put you off, it has nothing to do with what the rest of us do :-) Apply here <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ls.st&#x2F;bo0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ls.st&#x2F;bo0</a> (I&#x27;m sorry, academia will have cool recruiting practices in, oh, 2045 or so). If you have questions drop me a line (email in the profile).<p>PS. You get to work with @astropixie in case you&#x27;re a fan","time":1496340532,"type":"comment"}
