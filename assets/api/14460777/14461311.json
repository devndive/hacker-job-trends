We handle 10s of millions of uniques a month with only 3.5 Back End Engineers.  We also go home on time and sleep through the night without PD going off every few minutes.  Our code is mostly Ruby and Rails but, we have a little Go and Clojure.  Having just returned from Lambdaconf we&#x27;re getting ready to start some projects in Elixir.","time":1496332140,"type":"comment"}
