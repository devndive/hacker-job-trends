Initially, our network will connect remote assets in the air and on the Earth&#x27;s surface and more than triple data downlink from remote sensing satellites. At scale, our network will deliver global connectivity at lower latency than terrestrial fiber optic cables over continental distances. Currently, the company is on track for the launch of our demo satellite at the end of this year with multiple beta customers already signed up.<p>Founded by Harvard students with deep experience in technology and space policy. The team&#x27;s background includes stints at NASA, the White House, Planetary Resources, MIT, CalTech, Florida Tech and Harvard.<p>Job Description:<p>Analytical Space is seeking an Embedded Systems Engineer or Flight Software Engineer who will be part of a small team to write software used to operate and manage computing resources on a 6U cubesat.
