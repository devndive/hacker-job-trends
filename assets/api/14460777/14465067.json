Instead of using filament, powder or resin, our 3D printer uses industrial injection grade pellets, allowing all materials to be processed. And can use up to 4 different on a single piece. This allows our clients to use 3D printing to manufacture actual goods using real materials at a competitive price.<p>We are a team of 11 engineers, doctors and designers each with a specific skillset in materials, physics, mechanics, electronics and of course, software. We design every part of the printer internally, providing always more challenging projects to our team.<p>We are looking for an embedded software engineer with capabilities in electronics. Such a maker would take responsibility of everything close to the hardware here at Pollen. He would work with our software team of 2 and design, code, sold and solder on Pam, our 3D printer.<p>Send me an email if you&#x27;re interested: pd@pollen.am.","time":1496353134,"type":"comment"}
