Our long-term goal is to develop targeted cancer therapeutics. To that end, we are learning to repurpose and engineer life&#x27;s building blocks (DNA, RNA, proteins) to create atomically precise nanostructures that self-assemble into prescribed shapes and devices.<p>We are seeking a full-time software developer to help extend our computer-aided design tool Cadnano (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cadnano.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cadnano.org&#x2F;</a>) with several new features, in particular, 2D and 3D views for designing biomolecules as well as integrating structural data derived from cryo-EM and molecular dynamics simulation. Experience with PyQt and 3D CAD&#x2F;CAM preferred.<p>We work at the interface of molecular biology, biophysics, and computer science. Biology knowledge is not required, but the position offers an excellent opportunity to learn about biotech, synthetic biology, and related disciplines.<p>Apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;forms&#x2F;ZeZxikT8YtZ5Xfj92\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;forms&#x2F;ZeZxikT8YtZ5Xfj92</a>","time":1496333601,"type":"comment"}
