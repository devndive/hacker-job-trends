We check-in with patients throughout their treatment and recovery to understand changes in symptoms, function and quality-of-life. We deliver that insight to the point-of-care where it enables more proactive and personalized care, while helping providers demonstrate their quality to payers in this new outcomes &amp; value based payment environment.<p>We have a HIPAA compliant v1 that is live with customers and recently won a grant with UCSF. We&#x27;re focused on launching a self-service freemium version of our platform to gain grassroots adoption.<p>I&#x27;m looking for someone who is hungry for their next entrepreneurial venture, who knows their way around a JavaScript stack and has a track record of building web-applications. More than anything I&#x27;m also looking for someone who wants to build a significant company in this space, build a great team and have a meaningful impact. As a bootstrapped company with goals to raise funding later this year, compensation will be largely founder-level equity based +&#x2F;- a living wage.<p>Please get in touch by contacting Francis Wong (MD), francis@outcomes.com","time":1496346559,"type":"comment"}
