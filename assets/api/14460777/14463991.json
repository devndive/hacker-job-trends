We&#x27;re looking for a junior developer to join our small but growing team in the Bank&#x2F;Monument area of London. The successful candidate would be responsible for enhancing existing features, adding new ones (including greenfield work), along with some support and QA. Don&#x27;t worry, we won&#x27;t expect you to know everything up front, but we will expect you to be bright, enthusiastic and willing to learn. As you grow into the role you will gain solid experience in a range of technologies including Java, Javascript, React, Kotlin, HTML, C#, SQL Server, Oracle, OLAP, distributed systems, AWS, and a variety of well regarded tools and libraries.<p>While a 1st in Computer Science and experience with some of Java&#x2F;Javascript&#x2F;Kotlin&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;SQL is preferred, we realise there&#x27;s a wealth of talented developers out there who don&#x27;t fit that mould - so if you&#x27;re passionate about software and have some good experience under your belt or have made some interesting contributions to open source projects you&#x27;d love to share with us, we&#x27;d still be keen to hear from you. In return we can offer a flexible and very technology focused environment working alongside experienced developers, a relaxed dress code, plus solid exposure to the world of investment banking and capital markets.<p>That&#x27;s about it really! If this sounds interesting, we look forward to hearing from you at careers@percentile.co.uk","time":1496347475,"type":"comment"}
