We use Ember and Ruby to build the configuration and reporting platform used by retailers to gather and understand customer behavior in-store. Our hardware and software system uses computer vision and a wide variety of other inputs to answer questions that retailers are interested in: how many people walked into the store today compared to last week? which direction did they walk? is this store hitting its sales targets for the week?<p>I am the engineering manager for the UI team. We&#x27;re a group of 4 full-stack developers, looking to add more engineers who understand modern CSS and HTML; know Javascript well; and want to have control over the API side of their work. Experience with Ember.js and Ruby on Rails is good but not required. Remote experience is highly preferred for remote candidates. If this sounds like a good fit, please reach out to me! belden@retailnext.net","time":1496360232,"type":"comment"}
