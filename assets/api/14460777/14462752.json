Our stack is Scala (back end), Go, JS. We do difficult things, actual algo implementation and stuff verging on real computer science. We desparately need more people that know a <i>lot</i> about Hive, Spark, Presto, Impala, etc and are willing to make it very interesting for the right person. We have a great team with no churn because we trust them to make the right decisions and execute. Thank you and good luck in your search.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;atscale\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;atscale</a>","time":1496340051,"type":"comment"}
