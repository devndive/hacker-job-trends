In order to provide that insight, we have to collect the data, which is where our instrumentation agent team comes into play.<p>The agents that feed TraceView’s analytics run inside customer application processes, automatically instrumenting them to gather distributed tracing data and other performance analytics, while having minimal or no performance impact so they’re safe to run in high-traffic production environments.<p>We’re looking to hire folks immersed in the Node.js, Ruby, or Golang ecosystems--with bonus points for fluency in multiple languages.  (And really wow us if you have a systems generalist bent.)<p>You’ll be combining an eye for performance with digging into the intricacies of the language runtime and native extensions. If you have a passion for constantly learning new libraries and deciphering how they work, and enjoy working deep under the covers of the runtime, then we’d like you to join our talented and growing development team.<p>More information: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;solarwinds.jobs&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;?location=vancouver\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;solarwinds.jobs&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;?location=vancouver</a> (says Vancouver, but it&#x27;s flexible location-wise)<p>Apply above if interested or feel free to reach out with any questions: dan.kuebrich@solarwinds.com","time":1496342848,"type":"comment"}
