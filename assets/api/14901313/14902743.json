Specifically, I&#x27;m hiring both frontend and backend engineers to build Coinbase.com and the APIs that power the Coinbase mobile apps. Come work on digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum every day!\nAbout us:\n* We use React, Mobx, Flow, webpack, and styled-components on the frontend.\n* Our APIs are currently powered by Rails with a MongoDB backend, but we&#x27;re investing heavily in decomposing the monolith into services written in statically typed languages.\n* We&#x27;re exploring GraphQL for future APIs and are hiring two people to lead our APIs team.\nIf you&#x27;re interested, email me at jpollak@coinbase.com.","time":1501606252,"type":"comment"}
