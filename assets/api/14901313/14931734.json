Think Google Sheets, but like this: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alphasheets.com&#x2F;videos&#x2F;headliner.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alphasheets.com&#x2F;videos&#x2F;headliner.gif</a>.<p>We aim to be the Slack of spreadsheets - enabling you to do <i>anything</i> in a spreadsheet. We&#x27;ve gotten excitement from wall street quants, marketing analysts, pharmaceutical scientists, and insurance analysts. We envision a future where tens of millions of people see AlphaSheets as their tool of choice for data analysis.<p>1 yr+ React experience is a must. We have a React+ES6+Flow &#x2F; Haskell stack. We love seeking leverage through good architecture, languages (Haskell!), frameworks, and tools. (Doesn&#x27;t matter at all for this position if you don&#x27;t know Haskell.) We&#x27;re well funded so we&#x27;re not going away overnight. Our culture is one of efficient, open, and inclusive communication. You&#x27;ll be joining a founding team from MIT.<p>Email our VP Eng (Ritesh Ragavender) at ritesh (at) alphasheets (dot) com","time":1501877138,"type":"comment"}
