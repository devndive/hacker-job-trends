Depending on the needs of our clients, we take on end-to-end projects or integrate with existing development teams.<p>Over the past two years, we’ve worked with a wide variety of clients, which means a wide variety of tech, and we pride ourselves on being able to adapt and deliver.  Today, we&#x27;re working with Ruby on Rails and React.js; tomorrow, we could be working with something entirely different. While we are looking for a seasoned engineer, we don’t require you to have experience using a particular language or framework; the ability to pick things up as you go is what’s essential.<p>We work remotely from our home offices, and you would, too.  You’ll interact directly with clients and have the freedom to set your own schedule and complete your projects however you work best.","time":1501602989,"type":"comment"}
