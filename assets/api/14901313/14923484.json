We&#x27;re well funded by 8VC, Goldcrest Capital, and a bunch of great people who you’ve heard&#x2F;read about.<p>Our frontend engineering team needs you. You’ll collaborate closely with our product team to deliver a world class user experience on the web and mobile. We use React&#x2F;React Native for our mobile and web apps. We share a bunch of code between the two platforms. It’s awesome.<p>We care more about technical fundamentals than we do with knowledge of a particular technical stack. It’s helpful if you have experience with JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and any web frontend frameworks.<p>If you’re interested, say hello to us at careers@loaddocs.co. We’re based near Moscone Center in SF. I’m always interested in grabbing lunch&#x2F;coffee&#x2F;dinner with cool people and great engineers.","time":1501791826,"type":"comment"}
