If you have experience automating manual workflows and creating API&#x27;s around them, we&#x27;d love to speak with you.<p>We are a non-standard company by most tech standards. Weâ€™re bootstrapped and profitable. Instead of worrying about the next round or pitch deck, we are only worried about our customers and making the best product possible.<p>Our engineering team is currently small, and will be growing throughout the year.<p>You can apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.legalnature.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.legalnature.com&#x2F;careers</a> or email me at michael@legalnature.com with any questions.","time":1501634318,"type":"comment"}
