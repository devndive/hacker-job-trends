It can connect to 81 grocery chains like Walmart, Safeway, Kroger etc. and automatically download every purchase a user makes into the app. It uses NLP to match each product purchased to recipe ingredients. Over 1,000,000 products are matched to 1,000,000 recipes with 90% accuracy.<p>I’ve built Cooklist over the last 8 months and it’s now live in private beta. Hundreds of users are participating in the development process. 10,000+ purchases have been downloaded in the last week. \nYou can see a demo video at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cooklist.co\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cooklist.co</a> I’m looking to bring on a strong technical cofounder to lead the development of the mobile apps. If you’re interested in working on this idea or would like to try the beta, email me at daniel@handground.com<p>The last project I created was the Handground coffee grinder (raised 300k on Kickstarter): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;handground.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;handground.com</a> You can also find me on Github: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Vitiell0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Vitiell0</a>","time":1501599652,"type":"comment"}
