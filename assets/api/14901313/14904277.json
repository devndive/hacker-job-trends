We&#x27;re looking for an experienced programmer - the kind that could make it to &quot;software architect&quot; at a boring bigco but prefers to get their hands dirty.<p>Our stack is made of Elixir, ES6, React, PostgreSQL and a little bit of Node.<p>We&#x27;re particularly looking for people with strong front-end skills, with an eye for design and UX. This means that either you identify as a frontender, or as a full-stack developer.<p>We&#x27;re also looking to fill some commercial roles:<p><pre><code>    * Customer success manager - help our customers achieve their goals\n    * Content marketer - show the world what chat can do for their business\n    * SaaS sales guru - help build the worlds greatest sales team\n</code></pre>\nOur team is small and highly proactive, and we expect the same from you. If you need to be told what to do all the time, don&#x27;t apply. If you want to be the smartest person in a (chat) room full of interns, don&#x27;t apply. If you want to move fast with an experienced team, get in touch.<p>We prefer on-site for all positions, but remote is OK as long as you&#x27;re max 2 hours away from Eindhoven so we can meet often. Eindhoven has a great low-cost airport so this includes a fair share of Europe.<p>Apply or ask questions through the chat popup on our website.","time":1501614706,"type":"comment"}
