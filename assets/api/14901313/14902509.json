After they get a job we take a small percentage of income for two years, only if they&#x27;re making above $50,000. Our goal is to make a high-quality education completely risk-free, and make it easy for people to become skilled, regardless of their current status in life.<p>We&#x27;re looking for people who both love programming and love to teach. Empathy is very important, as you&#x27;ll be dealing with folks from all walks of life. Some of our students have never been given many opportunities in this life, and working with them is especially important.<p>We go much deeper than &quot;code bootcamps.&quot; Our current offering is six months of full-time instruction. You can see the full curriculum here <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LambdaSchool&#x2F;LambdaCSA-Syllabus\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LambdaSchool&#x2F;LambdaCSA-Syllabus</a>. We teach CS principles, and the vehicles for teaching those are JavaScript&#x2F;React&#x2F;Node and C++.<p>We have a small core of instructors (from Stanford, Berkeley, Hack Reactor), and are looking to expand our core of instructors as we grow the number of students we can accept.<p>We are announcing our funding very soon, and based on your usage of this site you&#x27;ve definitely heard of who funded us.<p>email careers@lambdaschool.com","time":1501605113,"type":"comment"}
