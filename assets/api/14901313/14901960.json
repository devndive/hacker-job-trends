We&#x27;re working on interesting and challenging engineering and product problems to improve people&#x27;s lives with great transportation.<p>I&#x27;m specifically looking for a couple of security engineering roles:<p>• An application security engineer (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lyft.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;software-engineer-application-secu...\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lyft.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;software-engineer-application-secu...</a>) who’s excited about helping Lyft ship safe software quickly. You’ll help product and engineering teams at Lyft develop new features and products that are innovative and protect our users, build systems and tools to make it easy for engineers at Lyft to develop safe software by default, and promote security throughout the company.<p>• A detection &amp; response engineer (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lyft.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;software-engineer-security-detecti...\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lyft.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;software-engineer-security-detecti...</a>) who’s excited about protecting Lyft and our users through swift detection of and response to security incidents. You’ll develop and automate techniques to hunt for and alert on attacker behavior with high signal-noise ratio, test our detection and response capabilities to improve our tools and processes, and act as a calm and rational incident commander when incidents do occur.<p>We try to approach security from a software engineering standpoint: we believe in scaling security through automation and tooling, and we ship frequently.
