Headquartered in London, SumUp&#x27;s major offices are in Berlin, Sofia and São Paulo. The Berlin office alone comprises more than 130 people from more than 30 countries.<p>SumUp could be interesting for you as an engineer in part because we cover so many platforms: we have physical hardware (made right here in Berlin), our own proprietary payment processing platform, mobile apps on iOS and Android, SDKs and APIs supporting third-party integration, and of course (the main star, in this team&#x27;s humble opinion) a merchant-facing web app.<p>The frontend team consists of 6 devs, looking to grow by several members. We are hiring both senior and mid-level developers:<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Senior Frontend Engineer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sumup.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;E4A7BCCB2B\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sumup.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;E4A7BCCB2B</a><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Frontend Engineer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sumup.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;10969B9646\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sumup.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;10969B9646</a><p>You&#x27;ll be a great fit if you have a passion for technical excellence, enjoy implementing beautiful designs, are comfortable working in a linux environment, and strive to learn something new every day!","time":1501610563,"type":"comment"}
