The company has developed an open-source application for building and deploying virtual environments (domains) to desktop and server computers. The virtual domains are designed to be social and interactive, meaning they allow for the real-time addition, rearrangement, and gross modification of 3D assets in a hosted environment being used simultaneously by multiple users. Our goal is to deploy an open, flexible platform for a variety of VR applications rather than a specific, narrow VR experience.<p>We are looking for software engineers with solid experience in C++ and Javascript to help us build the Metaverse.
