We bring tech and product thinking to an industry dominated by email, phone calls and spreadsheets. That means we can offer professional grade architecture packages to our customers 10x faster and 10x cheaper than a traditional architect.<p>In terms of tech, we are a very typical Ruby on Rails stack (Postgres, Heroku, Redis, etc.) It is a relatively young codebase, so no legacy technical debt to avoid. You would be joining as the first backend engineer, working alongside me the CTO. The wider team is currently 12 people (mix of Sales, Design and Architects), we are funded and are growing very quickly.<p>If it sounds interesting, drop me a line at jules [at] buildpath [dot] com","time":1501608943,"type":"comment"}
