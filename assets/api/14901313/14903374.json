We&#x27;re still a fairly small team within the larger Panasonic, but we&#x27;re growing and are looking for someone senior to take the frontend.<p>The frontend app is Go in the back and react&#x2F;redux in the front using google maps to do some of the heavy lifting, and several custom layers on top of gmaps. The app (back and front) has to stream data at super high rates over websocket (alongside traditional REST) (cars send a lot of data!) and have it available in near real-time, so there are many interesting high-data-flow visualization, correlation, and aggregation problems that ends up happening in or near the frontend. The future probably holds a fair amount of svg drawing work, which should be pretty cool (graphs, animations, that sort of thing).<p>Auxilliary technologies include Karma&#x2F;Jasmine&#x2F;Enzyme for testing (which is also quite interesting on this project, given the high data flow and reliance on drawing tools), webpack and babel for build, concourse.ci for CI and automated deploy, AWS as our IaaS.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in talking to an engineer about what we do, hit me up at jadekler@gmail.com.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in applying or talking to a recruiter about the job, hit up Jessie at jesseyjean@gmail.com.","time":1501609740,"type":"comment"}
