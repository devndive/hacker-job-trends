We recently launched our product, are currently being used at a few culinary schools and restaurants in LA and the Bay, and have strong interest (including some angel funding) from several big players in the LA restaurant scene - both owners and chefs.<p>The product itself is a web app. The browser side uses all the tools that I believe the Cool Kids are into These Days (React, Redux, a slow transition to Flow type-checking, etc.), and the server side is built with Scala and Play.<p>The technical team is one co-founder and engineer (that&#x27;s me) and one half-time (by her preference) freelance engineer, both based in Oakland. We&#x27;re at a co-working space on top of 19th Street BART station. Spatially on top of, and 50 feet from an exit - SF-based programmers, that may be closer for you than some workplaces in the city.\nMy business-oriented co-founder (her technical experience is mostly in hardware) lives and works in Santa Monica. Every week either she&#x27;s in Oakland or I&#x27;m in Santa Monica for two days, so an engineer in either location would have facetime with both of us; it&#x27;s more important to work closely with me, so Oakland is preferable, but a programmer in Santa Monica would still feel partly on-site.<p>Check us out at parsleycooks.com! (We&#x27;re transferring to a much better domain, worry you not.)<p>Ping me at asa@parsleycooks.com","time":1501640662,"type":"comment"}
