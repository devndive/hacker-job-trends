Today&#x27;s DEXs cannot handle large order volume and in general offer very poor usability. Further, unlike most centralized exchanges, users cannot trade in national currencies. We are solving this problem through a fast, off-chain matching engine and a global network of banking partners. We are also among the first blockchain projects to launch a token as a fully regulated and compliant European security.<p>Our founders are responsible for creating CoZ, one of the largest open source blockchain communities (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CityOfZion\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CityOfZion</a>), where we have created software used by hundreds of thousands of users. Collectively, our team includes PhDs from Stanford and ETH Zurich, YC alumni, and award winning designers.<p>Some tech highlights:<p>- Elixir for our matching engine<p>- React &#x2F; Redux for our front-end components<p>- NEO and Ethereum for smart contracts<p>We are looking for front-end and back-end engineers, developers familiar smart contracts, and PhD-level researchers in security or distributed systems.
