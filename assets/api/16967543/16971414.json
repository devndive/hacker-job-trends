Think of the Union platform as a way for folks running programs like 500 Startups (they run on Union) or startup challenges at organizations like Comcast or the DoD (they also run on Union) to organize themselves, between calendaring, discussion management, learning tools, and event management.<p><i></i>Our stack and processes:<i></i> Union is Rails, React, Redis, Postgres, Elasticsearch. We run on AWS, and our operations are powered by Ansible. We use scrum because it provides just enough process to make us productive, but we try to avoid some of the major pitfalls by letting our whole team chime in on the process. We do continuous integration and delivery.<p><i></i>Our team:<i></i> We are a small, lean team and you would play a big part on how we work. We have some very experienced folks on the team but our minds aren’t set in stone. Help us define how to make you work at your best. Our organization is diverse, and we’re at about a 50&#x2F;50 split between men and women org-wide.<p><i></i>Remote friendly:<i></i> We have parts of our org in DC, Portugal and Dubai. We’re open to people from anywhere but would love not to stretch our timezone span too much. But obviously we’ll make an exception for the right candidate(s).<p><i></i>Have questions?<i></i> Feel free to ask here, or just email me!<p>Send me an email. You can reach me at fred at union.vc","time":1525207603,"type":"comment"}
