So while they don&#x27;t write code for a living, they do work in coordination with product teams daily to build product strategy, help products go to market and get to do many creative things (training programs, partnerships, developer video content, etc).<p>All these jobs are also considered senior level as you&#x27;d be working with engineering and marketing leadership on a regular basis.
