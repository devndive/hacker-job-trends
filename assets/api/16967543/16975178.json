We work hard to ensure customers big and small can run automated tests on a wide array of platforms, or dig into the details on test failures with manual tests.<p>I&#x27;ve worked at Sauce Labs for 1.5 years in the real device department in Berlin. The company pays well, provides great benefits, and even flies us out to the SF HQ once a year for a team kickoff event. Our challenges involve solving problems few other people are aware of - how do you get into the guts of Android and iOS to provide video and remote control reliably across many devices, and keep that working when the next iOS or Android OS comes out? We&#x27;re also scaling to meet the demands of large customers who want to run more and more tests on every build.<p>I&#x27;d be happy to answer questions about the environment here, or the work itself.<p>All postings: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;ex5dth1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;ex5dth1</a>","time":1525252098,"type":"comment"}
