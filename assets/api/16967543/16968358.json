I&#x27;m currently leading an initiative to utilize GraphQL in new and innovative ways (using schema stitching to mix and match APIs as necessary, and developing proxy layers that can alter and augment data as it passes through).<p>This is only one of the many things we are working on:<p>- GraphQL based API infrastructure<p>- React&#x2F;Relay UIs<p>- Kafka&#x2F;NiFi for back-end data flow<p>- Cloud Foundry PaaS<p>Our tech stack?
