It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after five years, half of all schools in the US (and 90 of the 100 biggest districts) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be a full-cycle marketplace where schools can identify, purchase, integrate, and evaluate the hundreds of educational apps they&#x27;re using.<p>We’re a team of about 110 (35 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Golang, Python and React.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.<p>Learn more at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs</a>","time":1525213718,"type":"comment"}
