We are looking to expand our clientele. Our office is currently undergoing renovations in preparation for expansion.<p>We have three primary &quot;projects&quot;. One is the web applications (built with Knockout and MVC, but looking into more modern frontend stacks such as Vue.js) which enables clients to view and manage the data collected by field devices  and mobile devices attached to vehicles. This data (and more collected from various other sources) passes through a number of services that transform it into data consumable by the client-facing web applications.<p>On the frontend, we currently have jQuery&#x2F;Knockout connected to an MVC backend which pulls data from a SQL database. On the device side of things, we leverage Kura, an open-source, OSGi-based framework for IoT and connected applications and use a highly modular custom framework for various devices&#x27; configurations. While most employees focus on one side or the other, there is a ton of hopping around, as needed, so there are all kinds of really neat ways to learn and get your hands dirty.<p>We&#x27;re experimenting with modern technologies as well, including Docker for some of our new deployments and we just transitioned to a very cool datacenter. We also have ultrawide monitors. ;)<p>We&#x27;re looking to perhaps double the size of both development teams. If any of this sounds interesting to you or you have further questions, please don&#x27;t hesitate to email me! daniel.flanagan@mixonhill.com","time":1525268887,"type":"comment"}
