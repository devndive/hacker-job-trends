Which means skiing! You’ll get the chance to test and trial your creations in our mountain HQ in Innsbruck.\nYou’ll be working with a variety of frameworks and tools including Bluetooth Low Energy, Realm, Mapbox and Protobuf. We also use CI and UI Testing to ensure quality and you’ll be interfacing with other tools like Sketch and Paintcode.\nThere’s also plenty of scope for expanding out of mobile and getting involved with the core analysis engine written in C++ or our Python based server.<p>You have a passion for the outdoors and have some experience skiing.\nYou’ve had at least 1 year of experience with Swift or Kotlin and at least 2 years with software. If you have shipped or iterated on at least one app on the Play or App store then that&#x27;s a bonus!<p>If you are interested please email pruth (at) motionmetrics (dot) co","time":1525188552,"type":"comment"}
