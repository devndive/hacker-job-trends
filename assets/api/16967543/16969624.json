Our customers are working on everything from self-driving trucks to drones to sea turtles with cameras on them to smart buildings and smart everything else. We&#x27;ve pioneered bringing linux containers to ARM devices, and have built a complete solution around that, including an OS, cloud services, a beautiful UX, and of course, etcher.io.<p>We are looking for a person with a solid combination of Data, Finance, and Software engineering skills to work directly with the founders on building an end-to-end data &amp; forecasting model for the whole company, tying together product metrics, financial data, revenues and expenditures, as well as team data &amp; metrics. The resulting model should give high-level visibility into any problem areas and allow highly accurate scenario forecasting into the future.<p>If that sounds like a project you&#x27;d love to dive into, you&#x27;re detail-oriented and believe that everything is systems all the way down, drop us a line at join4data@resin.io with a CV and a story of how you used data and&#x2F;or code to solve a problem people wouldn&#x27;t expect can be solved that way.","time":1525197963,"type":"comment"}
