We fly them over farms and orchards, and process and interpret the imagery, allowing us to detect plant stress, overwatering, under-watering and early indicators of harmful pests. Farmers use this information to manage their resources, conserving water and avoiding unnecessary over-application of fertilizers and pesticides.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ceres-imaging.breezy.hr&#x2F;p&#x2F;3c362eafe9c9-scientific-tools-python-developer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ceres-imaging.breezy.hr&#x2F;p&#x2F;3c362eafe9c9-scientific-to...</a> or email me seth@ceresimaging.net","time":1526346536,"type":"comment"}
