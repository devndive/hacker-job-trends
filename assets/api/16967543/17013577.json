Nearly half of millennials believe in astrology – and that number continues to rise as more people are searching for meaning, connection, and community across all aspects of their lives. Since launch in October 2017, Co-Star has grown incredibly quickly and was ranked in Apple&#x27;s top 100 entertainment app weeks after launch. We are an early stage startup (we just raised a seed round of funding) looking to expand the team as we continue to gain traction and develop the app!<p>Some of the technologies we use include<p><pre><code>  - Haskell (our whole web api is written in this!)\n  - Swift \n  - Python (we use AWS Lambda to wrap python libraries we don’t want to port to Haskell) \n  - React + TypeScript </code></pre>\nWe are looking for a full stack developer who is familiar with at least one of Haskell, Swift, or AWS and is open to learning the others! We love types at Co—Star, and a passion for statically verifying code is definitely a plus!\nThere are currently three of us (founders) working on this. You’ll be our first hire, so you’ll have a big say in what we do and how we do it.<p>Contact jobs@costarastrology.com","time":1525707533,"type":"comment"}
