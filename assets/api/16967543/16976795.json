We also provide full parking analytics (occupancy percentages, duration of stay, turnover, etc) to cities, corporate campuses, universities and others hour by hour and block by block.<p>We&#x27;re hiring!  You will use Full-Stack Ruby on Rails, DevOps, and GIS skills to expand our tools, web apps, analytics, and APIs.

And do the same thing for autonomous vehicles as they evolve to become our new robotic overlords.<p>We&#x27;ve generated over half a billion parking events from Streetline wireless vehicle sensors deployed in streets, parking lots, and parking garages that are continuously streaming data to us from all over the country.  We are a real &quot;thing&quot; in the Internet of Things, not IoT marketecture.  If you&#x27;re excited about wireless sensors that live in streets and get run over by cars all day long, and ruggedized embedded systems that live on lamp posts, then you need to join with us and become part of the IoT parking nerd collective!<p>You can email me at streetline.com, with account name peter","time":1525268867,"type":"comment"}
