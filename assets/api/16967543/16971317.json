We develop machine learning techniques to better understand chromatin biology. These models and algorithms transform high-dimensional functional genomics data into interpretable patterns and lead to new biological insight. A key focus of the lab is to train a new generation of computational biologists.<p>We seek postdoctoral fellows for several projects in computational genomics and machine learning. Selected projects include:<p>1. Integrating epigenomic and sequence data to better understand human gene regulation.<p>2. Creating models of transcription factor binding that allow us to predict the effects of perturbations.<p>3. Developing deep learning techniques to find novel behavior in multiple functional genomics datasets.<p><i>Required qualifications</i>: Doctorate in computational biology, bioinformatics, computer science, electrical engineering, statistics, or physics, obtained within the last five years. Submitted first-author or joint first-author papers in genomics or machine learning research. Experience in scientific programming in a Unix environment.<p><i>Not required, but preferred qualifications</i>: Experience with epigenomics and graphical models. First-author papers published in peer-reviewed journals, refereed conference proceedings, or a pre-print archive. Experience programming in Python, R, C, and C++.<p><i>Benefits</i>: Includes extended medical insurance, dental insurance, maternity benefits (15 weeks), parental benefits (additional 35 weeks), child care program (fee applies), defined-benefit pension plan, and employment insurance. Flexible work hours.<p>We will consider candidates who need a VISA to work in Canada. We are especially interested in candidates who are women or members of underrepresented minorities.<p><i>To apply</i>: We will accept applications until the position is filled.
