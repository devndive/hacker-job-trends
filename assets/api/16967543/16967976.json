I’m posting because we are bootstrapped and profitable, and we’re hiring software engineers. We&#x27;re hiring engineers for our warehouse automation team. To give you an idea of what you’d do: one engineer on our team integrated with a large vendor of ours so we can run our own trucks to avoid UPS shipping costs.<p>Our stack is Node, React, and Mongo. Our team is currently 15 engineers (with 5 on the warehouse eng team).<p>Interested? Email me at ericzhang@scalablepress.com<p>PS: We&#x27;re also hiring engineering managers","time":1525189266,"type":"comment"}
