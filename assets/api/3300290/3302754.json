We're <a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.shutterstock.com</a> and looking for some talented \"webops\"/\"devops\" type people capable of scripting and are focused on systems automation. We've got 360 nodes managed by puppet and mcollective. We've got the ability for developers to deploy at any time. We've got real time application stats provided by a zeromq backend and node.js frontend. We're looking to build out additional datacenters and automation tools for the future and could use some more rockstars on our team :)<p><a href=\"http://hire.jobvite.com/Jobvite/Job.aspx?b=nxNm8hwA&#38;o=34&#38;j=o1z3Vfwi\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hire.jobvite.com/Jobvite/Job.aspx?b=nxNm8hwA&#38;o=34...</a>","time":1322801689,"type":"comment"}
