EZ Offerz is the first site that lets people make an offer on a home without a real estate agent – think of it as the natural extension of Zillow, Trulia, and RedFin.<p>After a ton of successful meetings with some of the biggest VC’s and Angel Investors in Los Angeles, all who love the business model without exception, the feedback has been consistent, “Get yourself a technical cofounder and we will invest!”<p>If you are interested, please don’t be shy…email me!
