Lookout is the current leader in consumer mobile security, and we're aiming to keep it that way. We're a small, well-funded team tackling big problems on small devices.<p>Perks include: competitive salary, benefits, mobile phone of your choice, dream hardware setup of your choice, and a new office space in January when we move (We'll be on two floors at Market and 1st). There's also the standard start-up perks like a well-stocked fridge, craft beers on tap, and the fuzzy feeling that comes with shipping meaningful, net-positive products.<p>For engineering, experience in Rails, iOS, Android, and/or network/mobile security are awesome to have, but not required.<p>With respect to data, If you're interested in machine learning and implementing it in any language, then I'm interested in a conversation with you. Bonus points if you use plyr.<p>We are also looking for: a lead UX designer, a senior PM, QA, ops, technical recruiter, and a lot more. Check out the link and see if anything interests you.<p>I like it here--everyone here is conscious about how it's very easy to inject FUD into the mobile security space, and we really believe in selling a mobile security product that isn't based on fear, uncertainty, and doubt. If you decide to give us a pass, do find a startup on this page with people you truly enjoy working with--they honestly make all the difference!<p>Regardless of whatever position you're interested in, send me an e-mail with questions, resumes, requests for beer, etc. to thomson.nguyen@mylookout.com.<p>(Response guaranteed!)","time":1322773768,"type":"comment"}
