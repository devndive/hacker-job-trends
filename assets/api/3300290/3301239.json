We also feel like the Web is in its infancy in terms of helping us to make better decisions based on data and that this space will explode in coming years.<p>We're planning to help detonate that explosion. :)<p>A few things about us:<p>- We have a long backlog of customers waiting to use our product when it launches and a big market in front of us.<p>- We're building an engineering-centric organization and working out of a cool work/live space in the Mission.<p>- We offer outstanding benefits, treat engineers and designers like the VIPs they are and value balance while at the same time working hard and passionately towards our goals.<p>- Our current stack includes Ruby, Rails, MySQL, Resque, and elasticsearch and we'll be diving in soon on Hadoop, graph databases/neo4j and a whole host of other fun stuff.<p>- We're also planning to contribute to open source as much as we can (e.g., <a href=\"https://github.com/rglabs/teleport\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/rglabs/teleport</a>).<p>- We're funded but also early in our lifecycle so it's a unique opportunity to be a major contributor and help to set the tone for the future for our company.<p>To hear more drop me a line directly at jon@rglabsinc.com or contact us via our website (<a href=\"http://www.rglabsinc.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.rglabsinc.com</a>). We'd love to tell you more.","time":1322770935,"type":"comment"}
