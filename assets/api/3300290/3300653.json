All of our calculations live in ruby at the moment, but we need to be smarter about building an elegant/sane data processing world.<p>The appeal of this role is the opportunity to build something users really need that draws from the best aspects of traditional business intelligence, big data, NoSQL, real time analytics, and statistics. Profitably is building the future of BI with a respectful nod to what’s come before, and you will be the tip of the spear.","time":1322762156,"type":"comment"}
