Unlike videoconferencing, youâ€™re not stuck to a wall or desk.  It becomes your physical presence, anywhere in the world, with the freedom to move and interact with people as if you were there.  Our technology has already been seen by millions of people, and we think the potential impact is substantial.<p>We're looking for great engineers, designers, testers, and more.  We need help in C++, audio and video software and codecs, web frontend and backend, UI/UX design, electrical, and networking.  We think this could be a unique opportunity for someone with experience in web or mobile to work on something a little different.<p>More information is available on our site: \n<a href=\"http://suitabletech.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://suitabletech.com</a><p>Contact:\njobs@suitabletech.com","time":1322760304,"type":"comment"}
