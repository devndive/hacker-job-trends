We are a VoD company with a focus on bringing the best films to our customers around the globe.  What sets us apart is true editorial credibility in the film world, and a strategy building social traction with a cinephile audience before putting Studio content deals in place.  That time has now come. We are at an inflection point where we will massively scale the subscriber base.<p>The product is a streaming service and social network currently available on the web, iOS, Android, Amazon Fire TV, PlayStation, Samsung Smart TVs, and several more on the way.  It is build primarily of Ruby, Rails, Backbone + Marionette, and the usual client-side VoD frameworks.  We are heavily invested in Chef for configuration management, both at Engine Yard where we host our main applications, and also for newer infrastructure such as our custom-built CDN that we are tuning to deliver a better QoS than off-the-shelf vendors can provide.<p>Although we were founded in Palo Alto, currently the CEO and bulk of our team is based in London due to the UK being our primary growth market.  We are now looking to move the product and engineering center of gravity to San Francisco in a run up to make the US a primary market in 2016 and beyond.  You would be joining as #10 software engineer overall, and will play a significant role in defining the architecture of our application as we scale.  Strong ruby, rails, javascript and backbone skills are ideal, though this can be substituted by strong web and backend development skills in similar languages and architectures.  VoD and client-side video app development are a bonus but not required.  You will have significant opportunity to define your own position and work on any area of our technology where you can add value.<p>If you are interested please contact me by email, which can be found on my MUBI profile at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mubi.com&#x2F;users&#x2F;2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mubi.com&#x2F;users&#x2F;2</a>","time":1446496999,"type":"comment"}
