Along the way, you&#x27;ll get the opportunity to work with a globally distributed team (we have more than 200 freelancers, representing greater that 50% of our engineering headcount, hired off or our platform working on and leading various engineering teams) and hang out with them on our bi-annual offsites (my team just returned from one in Lisbon).<p>I&#x27;m specifically looking to hire someone who can be an engineering lead on a team that&#x27;s building Java based micro services (deployed on AWS). You will be responsible for working with the product and other engineering teams to architect said services, deploy them, manage them, break them (and then fix them) and help other teams who are not as familiar with concepts such as service boundaries, benefits vs. costs of asynchronous architectures etc. More about the position is at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;lqJZcF\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;lqJZcF</a>.<p>We have two offices; one in the city (SoMa) and another in Mountain View.
