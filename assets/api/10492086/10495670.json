R experience preferred.<p>Silent Spring Institute is an independent non-profit research organization dedicated to identifying—and changing—the links between the environment and women&#x27;s health, especially breast cancer. Our research focuses on breast cancer and environmental pollutants, especially hormone disruptors and animal mammary gland carcinogens. We develop and apply new technologies to differentiate hazardous and safer chemicals, to measure exposures, and to identify effective exposure reduction strategies.<p>Projects may include<p>• Analysis of high-throughput toxicity testing and gene expression experiments for insights about the mechanisms of chemical carcinogenesis<p>• Mapping the “exposome” and “metabolome” by developing computational methods for new, more comprehensive analyses of chemicals in human tissues<p>• Text mining to uncover trends in published research on suspected carcinogens<p>• Identifying unique exposures of workers in high-risk occupations<p>Read more and apply at: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;silentspring.org&#x2F;opportunities-silent-spring-institute#Data%20Scientist\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;silentspring.org&#x2F;opportunities-silent-spring-institut...</a>","time":1446502039,"type":"comment"}
