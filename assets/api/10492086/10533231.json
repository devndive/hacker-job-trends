We seek to exploit that special role by delivering a relevant and potentially personalised televisual experience from our cloud-based software-as-a-service platform, Suggested TV. Whilst we use web technologies, the user experience that we deliver is more like a TV channel than a web site or a mobile app. We provide our clients with editorial tools to allow them to control the user experience and powerful analytics to help guide those choices.\nWe have been around for over 5 years now however it still feels a lot like a start-up (and in many ways it is). From a technical point of view, there&#x27;s a big roadmap of exciting and challenging work ahead of us.\nOur tech: - Scala, Akka, Play Framework - Neo4J, SQL - Git, BitBucket, Jira, HipChat, Jenkins - Cloud infrastructure on AWS and Azure<p>Skills &amp; Requirements: - You have solid Java skills and some functional programming experience, preferably with Scala. - You are a great web developer.  - You are familiar with agile development and continuous deployment methodologies.  - You have experience and the scars to prove it. - You are a great team player. - You always feel responsible and want to deliver the best you can.\nIf this sounds interesting, please contact me at recruit@easeltv.com","time":1447079935,"type":"comment"}
