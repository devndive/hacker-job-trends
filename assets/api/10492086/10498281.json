I launched Bidsketch working nights and weekends, and eventually grew it to a small team of four. Now we&#x27;re looking for someone with Rails experience to join the team.<p>Some of the benefits:<p>- Work remotely<p>- Flexible schedule<p>- No layers of management and no investors or shrinking runway to worry about<p>- Fun and friendly team that gets stuff done<p>We currently have a great team of four :) I&#x27;m the founder -- I mostly do marketing and some lightweight coding. Nicole does customer success (which means she helps customers). Eric and Paul do a lot of the heavy lifting and spend most their time writing code.
