Our mission is to help neighbours to connect and build stronger, safer, friendlier communities. Today, over 1,000,000 people use Streetlife to exchange local news, events and recommendations, to make real-world connections and to get together to improve their neighbourhoods.<p>We&#x27;re a small team of smart, driven and determined people, based in Covent Garden. Our meetings are informal, our fridge is always full of drinks and snacks, and we&#x27;re out to change the world, one community at a time. We treat our employees like adults, and trust them to work in whatever way helps them to be most productive. There are no fixed office hours, timesheets, or managers watching the clock and you can take as much or as little time off for holidays as you want.<p>More information: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.streetlife.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.streetlife.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a>","time":1446478532,"type":"comment"}
