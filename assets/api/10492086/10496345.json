We&#x27;re 100% utilizing Azure services in every way that makes sense for us. the more we use them the more impressed we are with the offering.<p>We&#x27;re only 4 months into development of this greenfield dev project so as a member of our engineering team you&#x27;d have the ability to drive technical direction across the API or UI, whichever you prefer. Junior or senior level, doesn&#x27;t matter, we just want smart people that want to be a long-term team member.<p>Also looking for two test engineers, one on the JS side (protractor&#x2F;karma) and one on the .net (nUnit) to help us build out solid e2e test test automation for our code-base and expand on our unit test coverage.<p>Remember these are <i>full-time positions</i>, no contractors looking for a couple weeks of work until their next gig comes around. Your location is irrelevant, just as long as you get your work done. Good salary, bonuses, random perks.<p>Fun small engineering team with a stable company.  We all work remote and communicate primarily on slack&#x2F;screenhero (when screenhero isn&#x27;t flaking out). We do occasional company sponsored meetups, just got back from a conference in vegas last week. lot of fun.<p>Email me at ktavera@topofmind.com (i&#x27;m in charge of the engineering team) if you want to talk about joining the team!","time":1446508590,"type":"comment"}
