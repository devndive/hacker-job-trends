We help organizations and individuals make sense of data generated from a wide variety of sources and systems. This includes everything from traditional server logs to the immense volume of data generated by IoT devices.<p>One of my favorite use cases is using Splunk to analyze driving habits from the data gathered from Fordâ€™s Open XC project. We were able to easily set up dashboards and see the differences between gas and electric car drivers.
