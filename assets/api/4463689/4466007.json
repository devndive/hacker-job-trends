We have had lots of interviews but haven't found the correct fit yet. We primarily work on Symfony 2 (<a href=\"http://symfony.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://symfony.com</a>) projects with some legacy Symfony 1.4. We are currently in the process of moving more of our projects to the \"cloud\". We have lots of clients and we are always busy. So if you like to stay busy, there will always be something to do.<p>The work environment is great. We have nerf guns, remote helicopters, and a large break room with free snacks and Mountain Dew. There is also plenty of fresh fruit and juice if that's what you're into.<p>Just for full disclosure, I'm a Senior Developer, not the HR department. You can check out our web site at <a href=\"http://iostudio.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://iostudio.com</a> or feel free to send me your resume Joshua.Estes@iostudio.com and I can pass them along to the HR department.<p>Thanks guys","time":1346556268,"type":"comment"}
