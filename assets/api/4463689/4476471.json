A truly global service that is changing the way business is done in the developing world?<p>The idea for Jana started at the MIT Media Lab. Jana connects Western companies to developing world consumers.  We give away free mobile airtime in exchange for market research information or as an incentive to try a new product. To the users of prepaid phones in the developing world, this free airtime is as good as cash.<p>We are using Python, Flask, CouchDB and Redis. We host everything with Ubuntu on EC2 and other Amazon Web Services. Git makes our codebase easy to work with. We have a small team of bright developers who get things done and like working together. We do not hire on a specific set of skills or list of buzzwords in your résumé.<p>We work with 4 of the top 5 consumer brands world wide, but we're still very much a startup. For fun we play ping pong, or Settlers of Catan. We have a \"magic\" kitchen whiteboard where anything you write down shows up in the fridge the next day. Our office is in an awesome location on Boylston Street in Boston's Back Bay.<p>If you are a great problem solver and you want to work on changing the world, get in touch with us. <a href=\"http://jobsco.re/OVBhqL\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jobsco.re/OVBhqL</a>","time":1346791942,"type":"comment"}
