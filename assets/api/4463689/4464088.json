If you ever purchased a ticket to a sports game online or called a broker for seats to a concert, chances are our system was used somewhere in between.  We recently closed a Series-A round and launched our newest partner cheaptickets.com.<p>We use Ruby on Rails, JavaScript with BackBone and Knockout, and PostgreSQL day-to-day.  We are also starting to dive into Erlang and Riak and are looking for engineers who are comfortable getting out of their comfort-zone.  Besides working on challenging problems, we also sport a 40-hour work week, have a laid-back office, and pay market salary along with equity and health insurance.<p>If you are intersted in learning more, email me directly at rsosinski@ticketevolution.com.","time":1346515353,"type":"comment"}
