Your grandmother will use this product.<p>Join our tight-knit team of 35 (~10 Engineers from MIT, Microsoft, and Amazon) in our Palo Alto house and help us scale up this fast-growing company. You'll wear lots of hats, have immense room for professional development and growth, and be able to make a huge impact on our product and organization.<p>You'll also be given a lot of flexibility but we have a few unalterable rules: be straight-forward, own your work, stay in touch, and get stuff done. We have fun too - dominate other local startups with us in soccer matches, take a break for an impromptu counterstrike battle, or chow down at our monthly BBQ.<p>Our favorite tools are Python and C++, but our platforms are complex and we learn new technologies daily. Most of our engineers get their hands on a variety of projects, although we could use specialization in the areas of Front-End and Back End. We even have opportunities for Interns and a Manager - just reach out!<p>You can view complete details on our company and specific openings at www.elacarte.com/about or take our challenge at www.elacarte.com/challenge so we can assess your skills instead of your resume writing abilities.","time":1346808531,"type":"comment"}
