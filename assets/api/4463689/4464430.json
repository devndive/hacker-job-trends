J.Crew is expanding rapidly right now both domestically and internationally and we are looking for good devs -- and techies of all kinds actually! -- for our NYC headquarters. (We don't work with recruiters. Sorry, recruiters). My contact info is in my profile if you're interested in finding out more and are in the New York area or are interested in moving here (We don't permit remote work - except with our team in India).<p>Also, <i>please keep in mind</i> that, while you are free to apply for the job listings you can find on our website, if you're good and  have an interest in working for us, at the moment (because of our rapid growth) <i>there is very likely to be another role that can be carved out for you depending on your skills and/or interests</i>. I may be able to help if you fall into the latter category.<p>Some of the perks include 5 weeks of paid time off (to be precise, 25 days of paid time off includes sick days,  personal days and vacation days), half-day summer Fridays (just ending! sob!), free in-house masseuse, Starbucks coffee, balanced gender ratio, clothing discounts that can be as high as 75%, tuition reimbursement, in-house technical training and a really nice office building overlooking Astor Place with views towards lower Manhattan.<p>Regards,<p>Alleyn","time":1346521038,"type":"comment"}
