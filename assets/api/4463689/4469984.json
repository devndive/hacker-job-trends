Smarkets is disrupting the global betting industry by offering a modern betting exchange platform with significantly lower transaction fees than the competition. We have traded over £150 million of bets since launching in February 2010.<p>The part of our stack which runs behind the website is one of the few that uses Erlang as a primary language, and is supported by other well-known Erlang projects such as RabbitMQ and CouchDB.<p>The non-Erlang pieces of our stack are mostly written in Python, and relies heavily on asynchronous programming techniques and REST. We use the following technologies: VirtualBox, Vagrant, Flask, gunicorn, PostgreSQL, Ganglia, Icinga, Graphite, Cacti, Jenkins, Trac, Git and many other open source packages.<p>We are well-funded and growing quickly so are looking for Python and Erlang engineers to join our team.\nIf you are looking for a flexible, agile team to work with; want to work somewhere free of big corporate politics; would like a cool project to work on; we’d love to hear from you!\nMore details about the role and what we're looking for can be found on our blog:  <a href=\"http://blog.smarkets.com/2012/07/31/smarkets-seeking-python-and-erlang-engineers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.smarkets.com/2012/07/31/smarkets-seeking-python-...</a>","time":1346670938,"type":"comment"}
