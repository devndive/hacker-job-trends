The work environment is really great, and I get to work on interesting problems every day.  We are a Microsoft shop, so strong C# and SQL Server experience is preferred.  We are using things like NServiceBus, MVC4, Solr, MongoDB, Backbone.js and lots of other interesting technologies.  This position has a lot of influence in future technology choices, along with plenty of room for creativity and experimentation.<p>If this sounds interesting, shoot me an email at Daniel.Battaglia@tmp.com, or apply using the link below:<p><a href=\"http://www.jobsattmp.com/new-york-state/web-development/jobid2691963-.net-software-architect_tech-lead-nyc-jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.jobsattmp.com/new-york-state/web-development/jobi...</a>","time":1346528425,"type":"comment"}
