Our stack is Mongo, Node, React and React Native and you will be working on really interesting problems which, while we sell B2B, affect and are used by hundreds of thousands of consumers in different countries and languages.<p>Part home office&#x2F;remote is a possibility (and a flexible work-life balance that suits you is proactively encouraged), however at least 2 days&#x2F;week onsite is a requirement.<p>Interested? Email me and mention you’re from HN. No need to send a resume—I’d like to hear about what you’ve been working on lately, and feel free to include any relevant project links.<p>Louis | Cofounder, Gymhopper | louis@gymhopper.com","time":1470129981,"type":"comment"}
