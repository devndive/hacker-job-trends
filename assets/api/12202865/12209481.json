We help people build real businesses from their passion and quit their day jobs.<p>I&#x27;m looking for a few more software engineers to join us here in New York. We work on a React app talking to a Python backend hosted on AWS. As long as you&#x27;re excited to learn that, I don&#x27;t really care what language you write at the moment. If you enjoy building a great user experience and understand most parts of a web stack (no need to be an expert in all of it) we should talk!<p>Engineers at Tictail work as part of small autonomous teams that set their own roadmap and work on a broad problems important to the business (our two NYC teams are Shopper Acquisition and Shopper Retention).<p>Our interview process does not involve any whiteboard exercises. We have a work sample test that we then meet in person to discuss, trying to simulate a code review or pair programming. We also make a point of you meeting people from other disciplines in the company, because we believe every skillset is important and makes the company better.<p>If you&#x27;d like to know more, email me: martin+hnwh0816@tictail.com","time":1470141787,"type":"comment"}
