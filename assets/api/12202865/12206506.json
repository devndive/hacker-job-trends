We are hiring web app&#x2F;mobile security consultants - basically, a client gives you a an app and some info and you try to find as many vulnerabilities if you can.  Being a profit center for the company has its advantages- our salaries are competitive (with a reasonable bonus structure to boot), and our work life balance is tough to beat - i took a few months off last year and nobody batted an eye.<p>We&#x27;d like people who are comfortable working by themselves - you have the support of peers and the company&#x27;s project management apparatus but the testing and customer work is generally pretty independent.  Being able to explain the OWASP top 10 and other common web security vulnerabilities is something you should be able to do in your sleep.  Mobile application skills and cloud security knowledge is a huge perk.  Finally, being able to explain and write clearly is important - you need to have both the written and verbal English skills to explain complex security concepts to both developers and shareholders.<p>Feel free to e-mail me at john.labelle@ if you have questions or want to talk shop.","time":1470089980,"type":"comment"}
