Our platform is hardly in beta yet but we already have a growing number of paying customers.<p>We&#x27;re a tiny team (4, currently) that values quality over quantity. Stack: ES6&#x2F;react, Elixir, and a little Node. We&#x27;re modestly funded and the founders have full control. Founders are a designer and a developer (me), so no explaining to manager types why, say, code maintainability or good UX are worth your time.<p>The &quot;ONSITE&quot; mentioned above means that we&#x27;d like you to live near enough that you can make it to the office occasionally. No worries if it&#x27;s not biking distance, once a week is fine. Our office is awesome and next to the train station.<p>I&#x27;m travelling so best get in touch with my cofounder at hello@klets.com","time":1470079158,"type":"comment"}
