In the process we&#x27;re helping them to feel happier and more confident about themselves. We&#x27;re backed by a collection of the top investors from London and Silicon Valley as well as Y Combinator. After launching 3 years ago we&#x27;re already doing $1M+ in monthly sales with over 400,000 men using the service in the UK.<p>We&#x27;re a team of 6 full stack engineers with lots of startup experience (the founders have started and sold 2 companies before), and we&#x27;re proud of the effort we&#x27;ve put into building and maintaining a strong engineering culture since the very first days of Thread. You&#x27;ll be one of the first technical hires and get to build and own huge parts of the product, and help us continue to shape our culture.<p>Want to learn more?
