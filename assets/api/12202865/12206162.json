Founders really invest in personal development, have weekly if not monthly happy hours, summer and winter weekend getaways, and the ability to WFH when necessary. Also, the projects are pretty engaging and theres hardly a dull moment. I&#x27;m on a small team working to revamp the entire US Immigration portal - high visibility, and direct impact on millions of lives. The White House has estimated that we&#x27;ll make a &#x27;direct impact on at least a million lives this year&#x27; alone.<p>We are hiring for a wide range of positions in software development. Looking for Ruby, Java, Python, .NET, mobile, and NodeJS engineers for a variety of experience levels. However, we have more demand for experienced engineers than junior engineers. Please reach out to me or someone in HR if this interests you. My email is glenn[dot]espinosa[at]excella[dot]com.","time":1470086900,"type":"comment"}
