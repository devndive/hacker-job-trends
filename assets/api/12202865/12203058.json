Each one of our ventures has large, critical technology components and we need a technologist to lead the ventures through key decisions, as well as roll up his&#x2F;her sleeves to build.  Candidates should have 5+ years of experience developing software, a deep appreciation for user experience, and the ability to build excellent technology teams for the ventures.  Spanish is a plus but not a requirement.<p>Along with being comfortable handling in various program languages, you should be excited working never-done-before projects in the startup environment -- being able to have the vision, flexibility, and smarts to create beautiful software. We like to see our technologists focus on particular ventures but then transition into supporting other ventures -- creating an incredibly exciting, entrepreneurial environment in which to work and learn.","time":1470064897,"type":"comment"}
