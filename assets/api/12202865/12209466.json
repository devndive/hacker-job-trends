I started by answering every phone call\nand building features after each call.\nFrom there we&#x27;ve grown rather quickly but at a stable clip.\nWe never raised money because we&#x27;ve never needed the money\nand I&#x27;ve always wanted to keep control over the direction and pace of growth.<p>After 6 years, I could never be happier with this decision.  Our development environment\nis primarily RoR and JS.<p>If you are a former LivingSocial or RevolutionHealth member you&#x27;d know me\nand I believe appreciate our stack.  We make heavy use of Elasticsearch, MySQL, Redis and Nginx+LUA.\nWe&#x27;re running most of our servers in AWS.  Did I mention we&#x27;re a small team, you&#x27;d have the opportunity to play a huge role.<p>[Edit&#x2F;Location] - Severna Park, Maryland nicely between Baltimore and Washington and super close to Annapolis.","time":1470141695,"type":"comment"}
