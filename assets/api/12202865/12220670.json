Looking primarily for DevOps and server-side Java developers (if your Java is rusty but you&#x27;re good, drop us a note anyway). I was working for a start-up called LucidMedia Networks (hence the &quot;lmn&quot; in the e-mail address below), which got acquired by Videology. Our stack is Java with Spring on *nix (Mac for dev, Linux on servers) with MySQL and some NoSQL stores on AWS. The Baltimore office also has a team on a large .NET stack as well (user-facing web app), but Java teams are spread across both offices.  We have some big projects in the works to replace legacy services, integrate with big partners in the ecosystem, and scale up.  We do business in North America, Europe, and Asia.<p>In general, our interview process starts with a take-home questionnaire to assess your skills.  If that goes well, then we&#x27;ll talk to you about it over the phone and ask some other details about you.  If that goes well, we&#x27;ll bring you on-site for an interview.<p>Contact me directly at sahil_lmn@yahoo.com (not using a company address to avoid spam).<p>I actually got hired through a HN &quot;Who is Hiring&quot; thread, and I hired 2 people through these threads. These things do work!","time":1470251849,"type":"comment"}
