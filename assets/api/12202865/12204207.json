Gradescope lets instructors give out the same paper-based assignments they&#x27;ve always used, but then grade them online, while keeping track of the exact mistakes made by every student on every question. This enables unprecedented data analytics: we can reveal which concepts a student needs help with, or which questions are too difficult. To top it off, instructors finish grading in half the time. We&#x27;re now applying computer vision to help instructors grade even faster.<p>Our product has been used to grade over 10 million questions belonging to over 100,000 students. We recently raised a seed round, and are hiring a senior full-stack engineer to join our team of 7. We offer market-rate salary with generous equity. We&#x27;ve got a Rails backend with some React on the frontend.<p>If youâ€™re interested, please email jobs@gradescope.com.","time":1470072198,"type":"comment"}
