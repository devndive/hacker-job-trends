Hunter and Schmit did a meta-study of 85 years of research on hiring criteria. [1]<p>There are three attributes you need to select for to identify performing employees in intellectual fields.<p><pre><code>  - General mental ability (Are they generally smart)\n    Use WAIS or if there are artifacts of GMA(Complex work they&#x27;ve done themselves) available use them as proxies.\n\n  - Work sample test. NOT HAZING! As close as possible to the actual work they&#x27;d be doing. Try to make it apples-to-apples comparison across candidates. Also, try and make accomidations for candidates not knowing\n  your company shibboleth.\n\n  - Integrity. The first two won&#x27;t matter if you hire  a sociopath.\n</code></pre>\nThis alone will get you &gt; 65% hit rate [1], and can be done inside of three hours. There&#x27;s no need for day long (or multi-day) gladiator style gauntlets.<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mavweb.mnsu.edu&#x2F;howard&#x2F;Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%20Validity%20and%20Utility%20Psychological%20Bulletin.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mavweb.mnsu.edu&#x2F;howard&#x2F;Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%...</a>","time":1470073221,"type":"comment"}
