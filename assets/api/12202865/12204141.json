We face incredibly interesting challenges in software engineering, machine learning and molecular biology, as we push the limits of diagnostics and genomic technologies. Join us on the ground-level for this exciting journey to shape our technology, product and company culture.<p>If you&#x27;re a software engineer, we&#x27;re looking for experience in front-end, back-end, intrastructure, devops, bioinformatics, and machine learning. We have a varied list of challenges; we build large data processing pipelines to analyze data from in-house DNA sequencers, separate the signal from the noise and extract what we need, and visualize this in ways that are helpful for scientists and doctor; we build web apps and tools for biologists and doctors to use to plan, conduct, and analyze experiments; we work closely with molecular biologists to analyze data generated by these experiments and develop novel computational biology methods. We use modern tools and technologies like: Python, React, TypeScript, Docker, Haskell, C#, on top of AWS services including: Lambda, Postgres, DynamoDB, RedShift, and ECS.<p>If any of this sounds exciting to you, please don&#x27;t hesitate to get in touch with us: gstock@kariusdx.com<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kariusdx.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kariusdx.com&#x2F;</a>","time":1470071701,"type":"comment"}
