Otherlab (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;otherlab.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;otherlab.com&#x2F;</a>) has several projects building compliant robots, exoskeletons, heat exchangers, and other &quot;soft&quot; machines. Now we have the opportunity to build some software tools to help make these projects even better. Experience with C++ and Python would be useful, as would some exposure to mathematical modeling, computational geometry, or current industry standard tools such as Comsol&#x2F;Ansys&#x2F;etc.<p>If you&#x27;re interested shoot us an email at hn@otherlab.com","time":1470065070,"type":"comment"}
