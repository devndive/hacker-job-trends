You’ll have the chance to bring all your skills together as part of a team that’s customer driven and excited to make more people love their jobs. It&#x27;s a mission you can feel great about working on every day.<p>You’re an awesome fit for this role if you...<p>-&gt; Take great pride in your work and obsess over getting the details right.<p>-&gt; Always look for places to simplify, whether that’s removing a button, or making 30 lines of code work with 5.<p>-&gt; You love using funnels &amp; analytics, as well as talking to customers, to ensure what you design &amp; build is best for customers.<p>### Tech stack currently includes (open to changes you advocate for): Rails, Capistrano, haml&#x2F;scss, bootstrap, jQuery, Postgres, Stripe, GCal API<p>* Interested in the role?
