RateIt is an Australian led start-up which is focused on helping retailers consistently deliver great customer experiences. We&#x27;re looking for someone with strong experience with C#, ASP.NET MVC &amp; Web API, Entity Framework, and SQL Server and strong experience with front-end SPA development - we use Backbone&#x2F;Marionette but you don&#x27;t have to have worked this -- use of other similar frameworks (ie. React, Angular, Ember, etc.) is fine.<p>We already have several world class customers such as Bose, Pandora, Calvin Klein, Samsung as well as Hospitals and Hotels using RateIt.<p>Our team are all remote â€“ so we either work from home, a co-working space or a mix of both. If you&#x27;re interested in working with us email me at neil@rateitapp.com","time":1470094597,"type":"comment"}
