We need to expand our team to enable us to deal with the terabytes of data we crowdsource more effectively. You’ll also be making our clients happier (and helping us grow) by developing more-extensive and more-accurate measurements of critical aspects of cellular networks.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a Back-end Developer &#x2F; Data Engineer to take responsibility for existing core data products, including the newly built online platform of OpenSignal Insights, as well as internal reporting tools that help us grow by providing our marketing and sales team with critical information. We&#x27;re also looking for a Data Analyst to work on competitive benchmarking of network operators and new analyses of our key metrics. You’ll be supported in all of these responsibilities by Ajay and Joe (that&#x27;s me), experienced data scientists with relevant Telco and math PhD backgrounds.<p>Contact join@opensignal.com with any queries.
