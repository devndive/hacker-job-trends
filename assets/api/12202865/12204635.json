That&#x27;s where the world is headed and we want to be the ones to make it happen. It does not make sense that companies have whole departments dedicated to this workflow with the technology available today.<p>You&#x27;ll help us build algorithms to determine a company&#x27;s utility for cash, integrations between accounting systems so they talk directly to one another, help us build the next generation of B2B payments that is as simple as PayPal&#x2F;Venmo, and more.\nWe raised a seed round led by top investors including First Round Capital (Uber + Warby Parker), Floodgate Capital (Twitter + Lyft), Fuel Capital (Layer + CoreOS), Red Swan (Coinbase + Buffer), Slow Ventures (early Facebook team), Hillsven Capital (founders of Ariba), and Paul Buchheit (creator of Gmail, YC Partner).","time":1470075405,"type":"comment"}
