We connect entities that desire information (universities, think tanks, companies) to communities of users who can provide that information (ie. anyone with a smart phone). We also do some of our own in-house research (for example, on global mobility: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobility.daliaresearch.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobility.daliaresearch.com&#x2F;</a>).<p>We work with a large amount of data, and have our own in-house data science team, in addition to the engineering team. We strongly believe in creating a positive impact, getting stuff done, helping each other grow, taking responsibility, and challenging ourselves.<p>Our office is based in Berlin, and we&#x27;re happy to help you move here. Despite the on-site requirement, some remote work is absolutely no problem.<p>The stack is primarily Ruby on Rails. We have a microservices based architecture, so technology varies. On the front-end we mostly use React and Redux, but some older applications use Angular. The technology isn&#x27;t as important to us as the resulting product is.<p>I&#x27;ve been here for six months so far, and absolutely love it (and Berlin too). Bonuses: Well-stocked kitchen, periodically provided lunches, an education fund for your own usage (I&#x27;ve used it to take German lessons and go to conferences), and our own boat, which we take out on the Spree during the summer.<p>Positions available:<p>Backend Engineer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daliaresearch.com&#x2F;career-opportunities&#x2F;1299216&#x2F;?gh_jid=1299216\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daliaresearch.com&#x2F;career-opportunities&#x2F;1299216&#x2F;?gh_j...</a><p>Senior Backend Engineer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daliaresearch.com&#x2F;career-opportunities&#x2F;1299217&#x2F;?gh_jid=1299217\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daliaresearch.com&#x2F;career-opportunities&#x2F;1299217&#x2F;?gh_j...</a><p>Senior Frontend Developer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daliaresearch.com&#x2F;career-opportunities&#x2F;1299229&#x2F;?gh_jid=1299229\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daliaresearch.com&#x2F;career-opportunities&#x2F;1299229&#x2F;?gh_j...</a><p>Technical Product Manager: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daliaresearch.com&#x2F;career-opportunities&#x2F;1116178&#x2F;?gh_jid=1116178\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daliaresearch.com&#x2F;career-opportunities&#x2F;1116178&#x2F;?gh_j...</a><p>UX Lead: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daliaresearch.com&#x2F;career-opportunities&#x2F;1170465&#x2F;?gh_jid=1170465\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daliaresearch.com&#x2F;career-opportunities&#x2F;1170465&#x2F;?gh_j...</a>","time":1536065058,"type":"comment"}
