While our main focus is on dynamic analysis using a sandbox, we also recently started working on a static analyzer to reduce the overall analysis time and enrich our reports with information carved from the file&#x27;s contents. Our initial release is written in pure Python which, as you know, has its limits performance-wise. So we are now looking into rewriting certain performance-sensitive parts of the static analyzer (such as file parsers) in a faster language. We think Rust especially well suited for this task, due to its safety guarantees, which are naturally important when working with malicious files, as well as its good interoperability with Python.<p>Since we have no experience with designing and implementing software in Rust yet, we are looking for a seasoned Rust developer to help us out. Aside from developing on the static analyzer, our &quot;Rust guy&quot; should be willing and able to mentor other team members to get up to speed with the language, as necessary.<p>If that sounds interesting to you, please consider applying at: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.vmray.com&#x2F;apply-software-engineer-rust-en&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.vmray.com&#x2F;apply-software-engineer-rust-en&#x2F;</a>.\nI&#x27;m also happy to answer any questions you might have, just shoot me an email at jteske [at] vmray [dot] com!","time":1536267738,"type":"comment"}
