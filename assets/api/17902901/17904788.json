Want to experiment with your so-crazy-it-just-might-work ideas <i>and</i> ship code? Come be our first hire (potentially a cofounder) and help build head-scratchingly accurate recommender systems for the masses.<p>Tamber is enabling developers to put 10x better personalization into their apps just by tracking user actions (in the same way they already do for analytics services like Segment and MixPanel). We are growing fast with awesome customers (TBA but roster includes some YC companies), and just raised a round of funding from some of the best angels in SF (a couple are listed on our AngelList profile).<p>We are looking for someone who knows a bunch about ANNs and TensorFlow, something about recommender systems and Golang, and a ton about writing good code and shipping it. You should also be interested in building a company â€“ or at least intellectually curious.<p>Resumes are good, but what we really want to see is <i>hard evidence</i> that you are going to be exceptional on our team. Github repos, competition rankings, and anything cool you have built, in whatever form it takes.<p>We&#x27;re in San Francisco and we would like for you to be here too. We can be flexible for the right person, however.<p>alexi@tamber.com","time":1536007684,"type":"comment"}
