We basically connect workers and businesses on a temporary basis so they can take temp. jobs.\nWe&#x27;ve been running our own operations for three years and successfully completed 10,000s of bookings for shifts in London. We innovate and use technology to solve operational issues we face, such as reducing no-shows, predicting latenesses, match the right job with the right people, offer the best pricing, etc. We used data and innovative solutions to address these issues.<p>We also have mobile applications offering a top notch UX on both sides, we built an internal community to engage our workers so they can connect with each other and share infos. We value flexibility and transparency. Business can book staff the same way they&#x27;d book a Uber. We handle payments, payouts, reporting, etc.<p>We aim to revolutionize the on-demand staffing industry, and we are now opening our platform and our tools to 3rd parties thanks to our experience in this sector, pivoting to a high-growth SaaS business model.
