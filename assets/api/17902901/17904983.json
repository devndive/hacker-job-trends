It connects the 4 billion people on the Internet to one another. It’s undoubtedly the greatest invention of humanity. But the ease of sending information unfortunately also allows misinformation to spread. How do you reconcile these two opposing forces, openness and trust? One solution is to hinder or to censor. But that’s been tried before and miserably fails. But imagine if information policed itself by the people creating that information.<p>At Trustory, we&#x27;re looking for full-stack engineers to help build this for the world. Our tech stack is primarily Typescript, React Native, Node, GraphQL, and Go (Golang).<p>We value ethical, curious, and passionate people. We don&#x27;t care about your grades. We don&#x27;t care about your pedigree.<p>We are building TruStory in a decentralized manner, using blockchain platforms like Cosmos SDK and Ethereum. You’d be one of our first hires, and get a chance to work with some of the most experienced engineers and advisors in the industry.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trustory.io&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trustory.io&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a><p>shane+hn@trustory.io","time":1536010200,"type":"comment"}
