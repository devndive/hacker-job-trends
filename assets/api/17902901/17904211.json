As a multi-channel retailer we have dozens of last-mile type integrations to make our business work. Our stack is centred on our Oracle based ERP, and includes Python, Bash and SQL. We are recruiting for a relatively junior developer (in terms of salary I&#x27;m afraid) to come and learn about our ERP and to learn about integrations and most of all business systems. We are anything but modern as a company, but we work 37.5 hours and are pretty low pressure. We do however have high standards! What we are really after is someone with an inquiring mind. contact in profile","time":1536000120,"type":"comment"}
