Or you could join our team and work for lots of startups, all at once. Latacora runs whole security teams for startups. We&#x27;re a weird kind of consultancy: we have only one kind of client, and we work full-time with them for 6-18 months, doing everything every startup security team does, from software security to cryptography design to AWS and container lockdown.<p>Our team has been doing security work together since 2005. And for almost as long, we&#x27;ve been hiring people who read these kinds of HN comments, in our own weird way. We don&#x27;t care about resumes or your previous work experience. We don&#x27;t care how much security work you&#x27;ve done before. All we care about is whether you&#x27;re interested in, engaged with, can lock in on our kinds of technical problems: finding security gaps and flaws, fixing them, and building software to mechanize the process.<p>More than you could want to know about our hiring process: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;latacora.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;latacora.com&#x2F;careers</a><p>We&#x27;re just starting to ramp up hiring and I&#x27;m a bit of a mess with it, but our process is better than it ever was at Matasano. No phone screens. We&#x27;ll prep you for our hiring challenges, and give you a practice challenge to mess with. We&#x27;re good at this. If you&#x27;re interested in doing security work, and you can code, you can&#x27;t waste my time.<p>jobs@latacora.com","time":1535993443,"type":"comment"}
