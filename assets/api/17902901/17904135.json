Using this technology, we remove the need to proxy payments through middlemen like advertisement networks. We can pay providers directly for their service on the order of fractions of a penny. Growing the Interledger network will help usher in a new layer of the internet in which value can be transmitted trustlessly and instantly, empowering previously impossible internet business models.<p>We are building on top of the Interledger Protocol which is a new open source protocol that enables the trustless streaming of micropayments across the web with just a few lines of code. Weâ€™re building infrastructure and real utility at the intersection of traditional fintech and cryptocurrencies. This is an opportunity to help lead the rapidly growing Interledger community. You will help shape, build, and own a significant part of what we believe will be a fundamental piece of the internet protocol stack.<p>Currently we&#x27;re hiring 3 Backend Engineers and 1 Senior Backend Engineer.<p>Interested?
