Our market is niche so we’ll never go public i.e. we don&#x27;t promise equity worth paper millions. Instead, we provide a supportive small team environment where your work will have a measurable impact, competitive salary &amp; benefits, and that great feeling that your work matters because it is improving the worlds’ libraries and schools.<p>5+ years professional experience with PHP or Angular, or both, is required. Experience in OOP&#x2F;MVC concepts is a must, too.<p>You must be highly productive working remotely as we&#x27;re a remote team. We’d prefer if you live in one of these states - NY, CA, FL, PA, MA, or KY. If you’re international, the working hours must overlap significantly with US working hours.
