In addition you will work on contract based design methodologies and how code can be tested and verified automatically by making use of SMT solvers like Z3.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.siemens-info.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;70396?lang=en-gb\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.siemens-info.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;70396?lang=en-gb</a><p>You can always contact me personally for questions or more information.
