Our company provides network measurement hardware, software and services to telecoms regulators and ISPs worldwide. We build own hardware measurement probes, which we&#x27;ve distributed to more than 100,000 users so far. Naturally, these all run OpenWrt.<p>We write our measurements in C and C++, covering a wide array of QoS and QoE performance metrics (far more than just speed tests!). Familiarity with working in embedded Linux environments is a huge benefit. We collect and analyse hundreds of millions of measurements per day using this infrastructure.<p>The role would primarily involve developing measurement software and also working on the probes themselves. We are also increasingly embedding our measurements in ISPs&#x27; existing CPE, and have so far embedded our measurement agent in millions of CPE across Europe and North America. So in interest in working with software and services running at a large scale is a must!<p>For more information and to apply please see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.samknows.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;careers&#x2F;embedded-devices-software-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.samknows.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;careers&#x2F;embedded-devices-so...</a><p>If you have any questions, feel free to email me directly at sam@samknows.com","time":1535992350,"type":"comment"}
