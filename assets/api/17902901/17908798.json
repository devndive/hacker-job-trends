We are developing whole-cell computational models to predict how cell behavior emerges from the molecular level. Our goal is to use whole-cell models to transform bioengineering and medicine into rigorous, quantitative disciplines. Our work is interdisciplinary and team-oriented.<p>We are looking for an additional team member to develop computational methods and software tools for whole-cell modeling. Examples of tools that we are developing include\n- An database of biochemical and genomic data for cell modeling and tools for discovering relevant data for modeling;\n- A framework for scalably designing models;\n- A simulation web service;\n- A database for simulation results and tools for mining large-scale simulation results; and\n- Web-based tools for interactively visualizing simulation results.<p>Whole-cell modeling is highly interdisciplinary. Consequently, we&#x27;re looking for team members with a broad range of relevant skills and experience in computational biology, computer science, and software engineering<p>More information: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.karrlab.org&#x2F;join\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.karrlab.org&#x2F;join</a>.<p>To apply: Email a cover letter and your CV to karr@mssm.edu.","time":1536066991,"type":"comment"}
