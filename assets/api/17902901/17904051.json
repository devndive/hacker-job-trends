It is a spin-off of the Institute of Neuroinformatics of the University of Zurich and the ETH Zurich. We build neuromorphic real-time ultra-low power AI and machine learning solutions, on top of custom silicon hardware designed in-house.<p>Positions:<p>1. Senior Software Engineer<p>Our software engineers develop toolchains and run-time environments for interacting with our custom hardware devices. They provide APIs and data visualization tools for working with spiking neural networks in an integrated development environment. In this position you will be contributing to development across our full toolchain. That runs the gamut from embedded SW (FPGAs and microcontrollers), back-end tools (compilers), high-level APIs (C++, Python) and front-end tools (GUIs).<p>2. Chip designer (Neuromorphic AI)<p>Our HW designers develop new neuromorphic architectures that comprise our core technology. Our designers participate in development of commercial products, from the ground up. They work on all aspect of HW design for cutting-edge neuromorphic computing devices.<p>3. Neuromorphic machine learning R&amp;D engineer\nOur R&amp;D engineers design and build new machine learning (ML) architectures for real-time processing, targeted for our neuromorphic hardware. They seek out new application domains for our solutions, adapt existing ML research to neuromorphic hardware, and devise new concepts for neuromorphic machine learning.<p>See <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ai-ctx.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;we-are-hiring-positions-available-at-aictx-in-software-and-chip-development&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ai-ctx.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;we-are-hiring-positions-available-at...</a> for more information.<p>Email info@ai-ctx.com","time":1535998338,"type":"comment"}
