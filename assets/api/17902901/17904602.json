We&#x27;re looking for systems engineers who are comfortable coding and troubleshooting features at all areas of the systems and network stack. Do you know how to override DNS on Linux so that it points to the DNS in your Kubernetes cluster? Then this is a role for you. We code in C++, Golang, Kotlin, and Python. Past experience with Kubernetes, Envoy&#x2F;NGINX&#x2F;HAProxy, and&#x2F;or open source projects a big plus.<p>We love people who are (or want to be) members of the Kubernetes&#x2F;cloud-native open source community, and virtually all of our engineers have given talks at conferences such as KubeCon, Velocity, ApacheCon, DevOpsDays, and such.<p>Email careers@datawire.io.","time":1536005308,"type":"comment"}
