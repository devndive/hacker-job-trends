We just received funding from prestigious VCs (unannounced).<p>You say Content Management sucks? That’s exactly what we think, and we see a huge opportunity to do something completely different that plays well with HTML5/JS and native mobile apps. The initial version of our platform is already used by hundreds of customers, from major global media companies to small development agencies (e.g. Viacom).<p>We already have a team of incredible developers that are working on the next generation of our service. We are looking for a JS dev to join us (Node + Angular).<p>Interested? Please send an email to sascha@thriventures.com and I can tell you more.","time":1364824781,"type":"comment"}
