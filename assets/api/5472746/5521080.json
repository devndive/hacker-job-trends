I was working for a start-up called LucidMedia Networks, which got acquired by Videology.  The Baltimore office is a .NET shop, but the Reston office is Java on *nix (Mac for dev, Linux in production, and no plans to use Microsoft anything for development).  Our stack is Java on Spring with MySQL and some NoSQL stores on AWS.  We have some big projects in the works involving big data and volume as we scale globally and across mediums (video, mobile, etc.).  Currently, our Reston platform alone handles 4 billion ad requests a day.<p>Contact me directly at sahil_lmn@yahoo.com.<p>I actually got hired through a HN \"Who is Hiring\" thread, and I hired an intern through these threads (using user name sahil_lmn previously). These things do work!","time":1365539083,"type":"comment"}
