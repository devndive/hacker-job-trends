We ran a pilot test in the winter with great results, and now we're looking to ramp up the pace of development.<p>We're looking to hire a \"full-time\" junior or senior UI designer to start as soon as possible. We offer competitive salaries with flexible hours. Experience with some parts of the Adobe toolchain is necessary. Experience with HAML/SASS is a plus, but if you're a CSS master it won't take long for us to get you up to speed. Preference will be given to applicants in Toronto.<p>If you're interested or have any questions please email me at martin@crowdmark.com.","time":1364841611,"type":"comment"}
