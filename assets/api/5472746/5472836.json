So you donâ€™t need to know Rails or iOS but you do need to have experience in familiar frameworks, and you need to be willing to learn either or both. Languages and frameworks can be learned, passion cannot.<p>Our development process is based on XP with an emphasis on individualism and pragmatism. We pair a lot, but not all the time. We test a lot, but not all the time. The key is being able to explain your practices with rational argument. Ultimately, we care more about building the best products we can, less so about being dogmatic about our process.<p><a href=\"http://www.neo.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.neo.com/jobs</a>","time":1364822667,"type":"comment"}
