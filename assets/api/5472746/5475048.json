But we're experiencing an amazing amount of success working with large hospital systems around the country, and we need your coding skills and imagination to do it better.  We haven't gotten around to issuing a press release in a while, but now we have multiple products and A-list customers are coming to us without any advertising whatsoever, and we need all the help we can get to constantly improve our products and dream up new ones for the healthcare industry.<p>So come write some Ruby with us.<p>You don't have to be a ninja rockstar astronaut guru sommelier kind of Rubyist, but if you are, that's fantastic!  :)  We have a lot on our plate and highly experienced folks would be a great asset.  However, if you're just a smart, passionate, friendly developer with no Ruby on Rails experience but consider yourself a decently quick learner, then we'd be interested in talking to you as well.  We're pretty flexible with work arrangements, but we are enjoying a lot of face time in the office these days since we find that helpful with figuring out everything we've got going on right now.  Please consider coming on board if you like companies with no bureaucracy and huge growth prospects!","time":1364841930,"type":"comment"}
