That's just a cash register, right?  Boring you say?  Hellz no.<p>We're working on an API-centric web application and a native iOS app.  We have a burgeoning data product and have started work on a payment gateway. We do front-end and back-end and web and mobile and data and security. It's a managed chaos of technologies. We work like horses, argue like lovers, and play like children.<p>Most of the effort is in Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and Objective-C.  Someone with experience in JRuby would be an awesome addition.<p>Most of us are full stack, but we didn't start here that way.  Right now, we are especially in need of senior Ruby on Rails engineers, great front end people, and another DevOps person.  Find out more about us here[1].
