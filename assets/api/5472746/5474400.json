Everyone in the company talks to customers regularly.<p>We eat our own dogfood, DevOps, A/B test, do Continuous Deployment and Customer Development.<p>We're still a small team, so you'll have a large impact on company culture. We're highly influenced by Valve's Employee handbook, and the cultures at . SF-local employees have catered lunch every day.<p>The frontend is a fat javascript client, using HamlCoffee, Less and Knockout. We have a lot of interesting design and data-visualization problems that need to be solved, as well as A/B testing, landing page creation and funnel optimization.<p>The backend is written in Clojure. Backend engineers should know Clojure or another 'weird' language (Haskell, Scala, Scheme, etc), and/or Linux dev-ops (C compilation model, make, packaging).<p>Contact us at jobs@circleci.com.
