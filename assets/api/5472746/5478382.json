You may be a senior developer who can head the technical team and act as system architect, or a middleweight developer with more interest in coding and less in leading a team. Either way you'll be comfortable with the LAMP stack, can work with HTML, CSS, JS, &#38; PHP, understand MVC, and can cope with the idea of turning legacy code into something testable/maintainable.<p>It's a great company made up of people who care about their jobs and actually listen to/involve the technical members. There are no marketers standing over you with bullwhips &#38; chairs demanding the impossible and no mushroom management. There is good coffee, a nice office, an openness to new ideas, and a strong work/life balance.<p>For more details &#38; to apply, there's a more traditional job advert on Stack Overflow: <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/30634/healthcare-startup-seeking-web-app-developer-dred-com?a=Ac0JAxq&#38;searchTerm=dred\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/30634/healthcare-start...</a>","time":1364895716,"type":"comment"}
