It helps you relive past memories as well as create new ones using music, and it gives you the feeling of being together with your friendsâ€”even when they are not around.<p>We have two technical co-founders (ex-Shazam/Google/Etsy) plus one awesome iOS dev.  We launched in the App Store 5 weeks ago, and are coming out of the Dreamit incubator, which has put us on a great trajectory.<p>We're looking for one music-loving iOS architect, and one music-loving mobile UX designer to join our team in NYC.  Both positions are fulltime and local in NYC.  Must be: awesome, startup-minded, experienced, music-loving.  Deep music, iOS, mobile, social experience a plus.<p>Interested?
