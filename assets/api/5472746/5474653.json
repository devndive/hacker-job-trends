We've hired people from these threads with everywhere from 0 to 10 years of experience. We're profitable, very well funded and have a really fun office environment (go-karts + a zipline!).<p>Scribd alumni have gone on to found 4 other YCombinator companies, more than from any other startup. We think this says something about the kind of people that we like to hire.<p>Generally we're looking for full-time and intern hires (junior year or older) who want to move to SF. H1B and relocation are no problem.
