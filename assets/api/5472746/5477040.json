Suffice it to say that this is a super hot space, so if you like sports and making money, this could be the place for you.<p>We're built on RoR, founded by highly successful internet marketers (as in, tens of millions of users and hundreds of millions of dollars), and we have a ridiculously nice office in downtown SF with a sky high view of the Bay and all three bridges.<p>Seed round secured. The original engineering team has built the basic product but is staying on with our incubator, and we now need a tech lead to join DoubleUp for an external funding round and spin off with the core team as a co-founding CTO.<p>Reach out to russ @ doubleup.com after checking out our site, and let me know where you'd like to fit in.","time":1364864371,"type":"comment"}
