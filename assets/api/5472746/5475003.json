We make sure money flows into the valuable projects that improve our lives. Our platform today helps users connect and fundraise around what matters amplifying their stories to reach more people.  We're proud to have raised the largest round ever on AngelList ($8mm) with a great team of investors including Kevin Rose, Mike Maples, and Reid Hoffman.<p>We're a small team of developers in the heart of SF that work across our rails stack, from optimizing relational database queries to building smooth javascript interactions. We work together closely, iterate quickly, and deploy to production daily. We're proud of our pragmatic culture and push each other through pairing, code reviews and speaking up. We use tools like Rails, Redis, Chef and D3-js.<p>We work hard and we have fun, too. Bi-monthly team dinners, in-office yoga &#38; pilates, ping-pong breaks, and an unlimited vacation policy.<p>We're looking for passionate engineers to join the team. You'll be given a ton of responsibility, wear as many different hats as you want, and have a massive impact on both our technology and business.<p>Get in touch with us at jobs@rally.org.","time":1364841525,"type":"comment"}
