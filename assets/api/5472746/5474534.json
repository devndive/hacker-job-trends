Our software processes billions of documents in real time, extracts semantics from text, and searches across disparate document sets and document types.  I also honestly believe our product has the opportunity to change the world by making everyone in it more productive.  We've built everything with a team of only 12: 10 eng, 1 designer, 1 everything else.<p>We're hiring all manner of engineers and engineering interns - generalists, devops, iOS, Android, NLP, ML.   We primarily use Python, Java, JavaScript, and Objective-C but we always love to talk to people with great general skills over specific knowledge.<p>Open source projects: <a href=\"https://github.com/Cue\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Cue</a><p>Tech blog: <a href=\"http://tech.cueup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://tech.cueup.com/</a><p>Jobs page: <a href=\"https://www.cueup.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.cueup.com/jobs</a><p>Apply to: jobs+hn@cueup.com","time":1364837504,"type":"comment"}
