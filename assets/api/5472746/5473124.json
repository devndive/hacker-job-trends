Actifio is radically simple copy data management. We've invented some really cool technology to do things no other system can, and we're dead easy to use. This is not your mother's enterprise software!<p>Actifio has been invested in by top VC firms (one of the very few East Coast companies in Andreessen Horowitz's portfolio) and is growing super fast. Recently, we closed a 50 million dollar round of funding.<p>We're always looking for smart engineers in every team, but since I'm on the deduplication team, I'll have to pitch you on that :) Briefly, our other teams include Java, C++, and Adobe Air, and work on things like VMware interaction, snapshot management, scheduling, databases, etc.<p>As for the dedup team: we write in C, and use Python for debugging and support scripts. Dedup seems like an easy problem to solve, because it's so conceptually simple: split the data up into blocks and make sure you only store one of each. But at scale, it becomes a whole different animal.\nWhen you've got 128TB of 4KB blocks, you have 32 billion unique blocks of data to manage. Making our dedup ingest, restore, and garbage collect fast is a great challenge, especially with \"only\" 128 GB of RAM.<p>If you'd like to chat about a job opportunity (in dedup or otherwise!), I'm at chris.murphy@actifio.com. Since I'm an engineer, I'm not going to type a list of silly requirements. Just send me a resume and whatever else you think I'd like to know.","time":1364825797,"type":"comment"}
