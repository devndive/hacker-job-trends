Our product is essentially smarter Facebook widgets that have been shown in case after case to provide a measurable sales boost. Our customers love us.<p>I work on JS mostly, so I know more of story there: we have an awesome, modular front-end app. Some of the technologies we work with include requirejs &#38; jam, handlebars templates, LESS CSS. We're also looking into a potential switch from our home-grown base classes to backbone.js. We only support browsers that have native JSON and localStorage (IE 8 and newer ;)<p>The business as a whole offers a fun, dynamic environment. We have a small, tight-knit team where each engineer has a real say in what our product becomes and how it's built. Your work is also somewhat self-directed, although we do try to put our customer's needs first.<p>See <a href=\"http://www.sociablelabs.com/careers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sociablelabs.com/careers/</a> or email nathan@&#60;company site&#62;.com if you're curious.","time":1364823408,"type":"comment"}
