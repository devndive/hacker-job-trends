We’re developing a range of applications and technologies to record, monitor and analyse container ship cargo operations (i.e. the process of moving containers on and off a ship in port), to ensure ships depart early and consume less fuel on voyage. Our long-term goal is to bring the widespread adoption of autonomous technologies to merchant ships. Voyages by ship are legally classed as ‘adventures’. We see CargoMate as an adventure too; driven by passionate problem solvers who are resilient when faced with a storm.

Built from billions of inputs, the data is constantly updated by Factual’s real-time data stack. We were named one of &quot;50 Disruptive Companies in 2013&quot; by MIT Technology Review. We have a terrific team that is still fairly small and an incredible CEO who was previously the co-founder of Applied Semantics (which was bought by Google and became AdSense). Factual has venture funding from Andreessen-Horowitz.<p>There are many challenging problems to work on at all layers of the stack: data cleaning and canonicalization, storage, deduping, serving, APIs, improving data using machine learning, etc. A great example is one of our most recent products, Geopulse Audience, which stands at the intersection of high quality places data and large scale analysis of user geo-data: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factual.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;geopulse-audience\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factual.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;geopulse-audience</a> .

It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.<p>We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here&#x27;s where we are now:<p>- We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.<p>- We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.<p>- Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.<p>- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.<p>- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.<p>- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.<p>Find out about Company Culture: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;transparency.narrative.io&#x2F;culture&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;transparency.narrative.io&#x2F;culture&#x2F;</a><p>Apply at hiring@narrative.io.

There are a lot of fascinating and challenging problems in this area: computing taxi times, landing times, departure times, airport congestion, flight delays, and more based on complex real-time contextual information. I honestly believe these are among the most interesting problems you&#x27;ll find to work on almost anywhere.<p>FlightAware has a vast amount of highly granular flight data going back many years to facilitate tackling these problems. For instance, we have detailed surface movement data for all aircraft on the ground at most major worldwide airports. We have detailed weather records and radar imagery. We have thousands of live ADS-B receivers around the world. And we&#x27;ve partnered with Aireon to deploy ADS-B receivers in space on dozens of satellites in orbit; this will allow us to achieve global tracking coverage, even over the oceans and other large bodies of water.<p>FlightAware wants to be on the forefront of tackling these problems using modern, sophisticated methods. We view this as a long-term strategic initiative for the company.<p>You&#x27;d be the first full-time machine learning engineer, so we&#x27;re looking for someone fairly senior and experienced. You won&#x27;t be a cog in the machine. This is not just a research position and will involve building end-to-end production systems, from training pipelines to real-time inference engines, so we&#x27;re ideally looking for someone with a demonstrated track record of doing so. With that said, we&#x27;re willing to consider less experienced candidates with exceptional backgrounds.<p>FA is a small company (currently 70-80 employees), but we&#x27;re not a startup.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do “expense reports that don’t suck!” (Google “expensify” to read more.) We’re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren’s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it’s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won’t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn’t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We’ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and Uruguay. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We’re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you’re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you’re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you’re this sort of person, you’ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn’t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That’s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it’s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I’m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don’t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com.
