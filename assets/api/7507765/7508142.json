We&#x27;re starting this mission by targeting the enterprise, disrupting the fairly outdated enterprise education and training space, an industry that has over 60% of its customers dissatisfied with current products!<p>We&#x27;ve seen significant progress within our first year of business. We signed a Fortune 200, 30,000+ employee company to a six figure contract within our first months and successfully launched to that company a little over a month ago. They now have over 20% of their workforce using Pathgather.<p>Our product is built on top of a modern stack using best practices: an Angular client that communicates with a Rails 4 API, powered by Postgres, Redis, and Elasticsearch. We also have a strong focus on product and design (take a look at our product, and we think you&#x27;ll agree). Traditionally, enterprise software has lacked in these areas, but we aim to disrupt that tradition.<p>If you&#x27;re at all interested or curious in exploring an opportunity with us, please don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out to me at jamie@pathgather.com. We guarantee an amazing opportunity awaits: we&#x27;ll offer significant salary and equity, the chance to work on real problems experienced by a wide audience, opportunities for open source work and contributions, and influence in our product, culture, and vision from day one!","time":1396360326,"type":"comment"}
