We have several technical projects going on like Artful.ly and NYCPASpaces.<p>We&#x27;re big on open source but looking to get bigger: github.com&#x2F;fracturedatlas.<p>The non-profit is based in Manhattan but our dev team is almost entirely remote. We&#x27;d prefer you be on the East Coast (DC-Boston) but as long as you don&#x27;t mind to travel then you can work from wherever. We try to rope the whole dev team together twice a year.<p>We need a senior Ruby&#x2F;Rails guy right now and we&#x27;ll be needed some more junior people over the course of this year. Most of our work is primarily in Rails but we have an iOS app, a PHP app, and we&#x27;r ere-engineering a lot of infrastructure so some of that stuff is open to discussion. I am particularly excited by Go.<p>Get in touch at gary.moore@fracturedatlas.org and say you heard about us on the HN news thread.<p>Thanks!","time":1396375722,"type":"comment"}
