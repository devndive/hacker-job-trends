Technology has made just about every aspect of our lives more interactive and we believe storytelling is ripe for change.  We think it&#x27;s time interactive stories moved beyond dragons &amp; princesses for teenage boys.<p>FableLabs builds NOTHING but awesome story-driven games for the tablet and web. Our team of creatives and technologists from BioWare, Maxis, LucasArts, Meteor, Natural Motion, and Disney have built and scaled products with millions of users and we&#x27;ve recently closed on fundraising to scale our team. We take the best storytelling elements of adventure &#x2F; role playing games but make the gameplay accessible, free-to-play and fun for those who donâ€™t have 8 hour blocks of time to hack and slash through dungeons.<p>We&#x27;re small enough (15, heavily weighted towards creatives) where developers work on everything but here are some more details about the specific positions we&#x27;re looking to fill:<p>* Senior Gameplay Developer: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1jVK24k\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;1jVK24k</a><p>* Senior Tools Developer: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/Ot93rj\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;Ot93rj</a><p>* Lead Platform Engineer: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1lLRDF4\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;1lLRDF4</a><p>We offer market salaries, meaningful equity, generous revenue shares, and healthcare&#x2F;vision&#x2F;dental benefits.
