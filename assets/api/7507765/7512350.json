We&#x27;re converging on Kafka with front-end and back-end services in Java. But there&#x27;s still a lot to sort out. A few examples of the hard things we need to figure out are how to efficiently encrypt all our agent traffic, finding a performant and space-efficient alternative to MySQL for storing time-series data, and upgrading our data intake protocols to WebSockets or similar persistent, low-latency connections. Plus lots more.<p>You can either email me directly, or apply through <a href=\"http://newrelic.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;newrelic.com&#x2F;jobs</a> - the data pipeline jobs on the site are the &quot;distributed systems&quot;, &quot;high performance computing&quot;, and &quot;analytics&quot; ones.<p>I will attempt to personally reply to anyone who emails me, but this is our first try on Hacker News, so my apologies in advance if I get overwhelmed.<p>- David Peterson, VP Data Services\ndave@newrelic.com","time":1396392820,"type":"comment"}
