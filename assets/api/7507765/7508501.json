We&#x27;re about 25 FTEs and 40 contractors. I settled here after working in multiple startups, contracting for a larger consultancy, and even co-running my own consultancy and incubator. I came back to Twin after a year hiatus because this is really as good as it gets. The leadership is fantastic, and work-life balance is deeply ingrained in the culture. On top of that, I can honestly say that I enjoy working with my entire team and look forward to our three yearly get-togethers.<p>We&#x27;re very selective with who we hire, but if you&#x27;re reading this then it&#x27;s a good start that you&#x27;re on Hacker News. For the record I&#x27;m not a recruiter or HR for Twin - I&#x27;m a tech lead. We&#x27;ve got some big projects in the pipeline and need to find the right people to join us ASAP. Drop me a line if you&#x27;re interested. Also drop me a line is you have any general questions about tech consulting.
