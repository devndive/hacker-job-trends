Our tools are tailored for a large population of students. We help them learn from each other. Our first focus area is software agents. We are building a Windows app called Inck that they can use to build their own software agents. This tool automatically documents their entire design and production process thereby making it easy to share. If you would like to join a 2 person team building Inck, as an apprentice, email me at rohit@khitchdee.com. In this position, you will learn about Software Product Lines and Generative Programming, both relatively new research areas in software engineering.","time":1396378303,"type":"comment"}
