We write code to enable our customers&#x27; businesses and then they pay us for it. There’s nothing more gratifying for an engineer than to see her work used and loved.<p>We build a product used by 13,000 organizations worldwide 24&#x2F;7&#x2F;365. Go ahead and tweet Grubhub about your food being late and their support team will promptly fix it, empowered by our software. Don’t try to game them because we’ll help them notice that too. We’re building useful tools to help organizations respond weekly to 10s of millions of these authentic social interactions. And, through clever text processing and analytics, we’re helping our customers make sense of billions of other social events.<p>Our dev teams are specialists who use the right tools for the job. Are you a deep front-end programmer, wanting to build Backbone apps with a strong emphasis on client rendering performance? Are you looking to build high-scale backend services, where you actually get to work on concurrency challenges or when understanding B-tree internals impacts our bottom line? How about herding our large server fleet into a harmonious formation with Chef, or enabling isolated micro-services via LXC containers?<p>We want people who care about quality, performance and scalability at a real order of magnitude. We are people who Get Things Done. If that’s you, then come join like-minded engineers. We’re hiring for front-end, back-end, Dev Ops, Mobile and QA. We also have a couple new roles specifically for a Performance Engineer and a Hadoop Engineer, if that&#x27;s your thing.<p><a href=\"http://sproutsocial.com/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sproutsocial.com&#x2F;careers</a><p>Aaron Rankin, Co-founder and CTO","time":1397481578,"type":"comment"}
