Our mobile-first web application aims to create this experience by providing rich, timely medical information and guidance, and by tracking symptomatic trends to alert the doctor of possible complications in preparation or recovery.<p>We&#x27;re built on Rails, Postgres and Backbone.js. We&#x27;re looking for engineers to contribute across the stack (and preferably to own a piece or two of the stack).  Background and&#x2F;or interest in statistics (classifiers, learning from data, predictive analytics), security, or medical systems (EHR&#x2F;EMR systems, HL7) is a big plus.<p>We are a user experience driven company.<p>We closed our Series A in December, 2013, and we can offer good salary, Series A stock, med&#x2F;dental&#x2F;vision benefits, lots of room to grow, lots of ownership over everything you do, and an opportunity to touch peoples&#x27; lives, directly, when they&#x27;re going through a medical episode and need it most.<p>Please send your best representation of your work to software-jobs@healthloop.com, along with a few words about why you and HealthLoop were made for each other!","time":1396379918,"type":"comment"}
