With so much traffic (50m MAU and growing) we gather a lot of data. We use this data to help plan new data center build outs through to A&#x2F;B testing product features to increase retention. We&#x27;re a small team (4) with a start-up mandate to revolutionise our stat gathering and analytics process. If you like working with terabytes of data, hadoop, aws and have a keen interest in building reliable, robust, high volume systems please reach out to me: ossareh@twitch.tv<p>Cheers,<p>Mike Ossareh - Twitch Founding Team &amp; Engineering Manager","time":1396373122,"type":"comment"}
