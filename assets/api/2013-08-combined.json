As one example we&#x27;ve recently vastly improved the source-map capabilities of the ClojureScript compiler. We do it because we want to give back to the communities that have enabled us, because it helps us, and because it&#x27;s interesting.<p>Looking for an engineer who loves the craft, who cares about building product, and is excited about helping customers.\nWe also explore some pretty awesome ways to escape from getting crushed under the heel of complexity, and we&#x27;re all excited to start toying around with ideas like <a href=\"http://clojure.com/blog/2013/06/28/clojure-core-async-channels.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;clojure.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2013&#x2F;06&#x2F;28&#x2F;clojure-core-async-channe...</a> for the frontend.<p>This is both UI and backend work.<p>Languages: Clojure, Clojurescript, Ruby, Javascript.<p>sean @ zenboxapp<p><a href=\"https://www.zenboxapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zenboxapp.com</a>","time":1375368344,"type":"comment"},{"by":"dayjah","id":6142456,"parent":6139927,"text":"Twitch - twitch.tv - San Francisco, CA.<p>Three years ago there was no &quot;real&quot; way to watch live gaming video online.

A vast number of new software talents, founders, software companies and VCs are moving to Berlin, every day (Twitter, Google, Soundcloud, Earlybird, Mozilla and many more).<p>3.

We&#x27;re talking hundreds to thousands of integration points for a single reasonably-large enterprise to glue together. In fact, increasingly the heart of a company&#x27;s applications is in the glue itself. And that makes for an exponentially-big problem for enterprises: how do you assemble numerous services into coherent business flows, efficiently and effectively, then operate them for months and years, and keep them up to date as all these APIs evolve? How do you even know all the integration endpoints and flows you have at any given time?\nAt MuleSoft, we&#x27;re already solving this for thousands of companies, but now we&#x27;re taking it to the next level, with CloudHub: a cloud-based environment which pairs with the widely-adopted on-premise Mule &quot;bus&quot; to be the nexus of an entire enterprise&#x27;s integrations. In short, CloudHub is where modern enterprises run their integration glue.\nAnd that&#x27;s why MuleSoft has incredible momentum with some of the biggest companies in the world.<p>Where do you come in?<p>First, MuleSoft is investing heavily in our CloudHub platform. Since it&#x27;s a new product, there&#x27;s very little legacy; and since we&#x27;re still a startup, you get to be a big part of a small team with a very broad impact. This is not a place to rest on your laurels: this is a place to make your mark on the world.<p>Second, you get to work on great technologies: single-page Ajax apps; client-side MVC using backbone.js building on RESTful back-end APIs; Twitter bootstrap and jQuery; LESS; grunt; node.js, of course; perhaps you&#x27;ll bring in some other new technology to the stack.<p>Finally, and maybe the coolest part: since Mule already has the world&#x27;s biggest companies on board, CloudHub will have the backing of the biggest customers to drive adoption of standards, technologies, coding paradigms, etc. So this stuff is poised to make a huge impact.<p>And you? You already know you can create killer UI&#x27;s based on the work of designers and your own creativity; and it&#x27;s a given that you&#x27;re a master of all things HTML5&#x2F;CSS3&#x2F;JavaScript. But isn&#x27;t it time you turned your attention to a really, really big problem?<p>Click here if you&#x27;re interested\n<a href=\"http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=o9SBXfwj&amp;s=ycombinator\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hire.jobvite.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;?cj=o9SBXfwj&amp;s=ycombinator</a>","time":1375379795,"type":"comment"},{"by":"clogan","id":6144282,"parent":6139927,"text":"<i>Boston, MA</i> - Associate Software Engineer (Local, Full-time) - Communispace (www.communispace.com)<p>We are a small team within a medium-sized company looking to deepen our bench and increase our capabilities through the addition of great engineering talent.<p><i>A bit about us:</i><p>* We&#x27;re the leader in market research online communities and develop software to enable consumer collaboration.<p>* We use the latest tools, in the past few months the biggest focus has been on JavaScript, ASP.NET MVC, and Objective-C, but Java (Android) is getting added to the mix soon.

This is a unique opportunity to contribute to the core architecture of one of the web’s most innovative and exciting services. You’ll get to work on challenging technical problems alongside a small but driven group of developers, and play a key role in shaping both the product and team culture.<p>IFTTT’s mission is to help people to create connections between the services and devices they use every day. We’ve built a system that enables users to set up simple “if this, then that”-style recipes, which allow activity from one web service to trigger activity in another. The current system supports over 60 unique services and runs nearly a hundred million recipe-handling tasks per day, and we plan to dramatically expand on our flexibility and scalability. Under the hood, this translates to building a platform that can talk to and move data between virtually any API you can think of, all in realtime and at massive scale.<p>We&#x27;re well funded, and we work hard to do right by our employees. New hires at IFTTT enjoy competitive salary and equity, full benefits, sane work schedules, and a flexible vacation policy. Much more than that, we offer interesting, deep projects and an amazing team experience. We operate on the philosophy that the best job perk is fantastic teammates, and to this end we’ve assembled a staff of intensely curious, well-rounded, talented people who happen to be great engineers.

The company&#x27;s mission is to accelerate the world&#x27;s research. 3.7m academics have joined Academia.edu, and over 300k join each month.<p>Many people believe that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to make science faster and more open. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu:<p>- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to make publishing a button, and the distribution of scientific ideas instant.<p>- Better peer review. Currently two people peer review a paper, which is too small a sample size. With 50,000 people worldwide in a research community like Machine Learning, or breast cancer, what 2 people think is not statistically significant. We need a broader-based peer review process, one that surfaces the opinions from the entire scientific community.<p>- Data-sets. Scientists don&#x27;t share their data-sets right now. The data remains stuck on their hard-drives. The main reason for this is a lack of incentives for the scientists to share their data. We need to introduce the right reputation mechanisms in science to facilitate the sharing of data. -<p>- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world’s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world’s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.<p>We&#x27;re a 12-person engineering-driven team based in downtown San Francisco.

The number of businesses using OpenStack in general and Swift in particular grows and grows, and it includes big names that make products that are used by both your little brother and your grandmother. You’ll work on a product that makes core OpenStack technology accessible to businesses of all kinds.<p>You’ll get open-source experience in a big way. At SwiftStack, we’re committed to strong participation in the OpenStack ecosystem in general and to contribution to Swift in particular. You’ll be a contributor to one of the most important Open Source projects currently active.<p>You’ll confront interesting problems every day. Writing a system like Swift and building a software ecosystem to surround it is the road less traveled. We aren’t writing yet another glorified CMS or social app or phone game. Whether it’s figuring out better algorithms for data placement, confronting a firehose of monitoring data, or determining how to integrate most flexibly with customers’ systems, there are always new and unusual problems to solve.<p>Interested? Send us an email at jobs@swiftstack.com. Send us your github profile, your LinkedIn account, a link to your website – whatever will best display the work that you’ve done.
