We&#x27;re doing this algorithmically, unlike some competing sites that use human curators (a fundamentally unscalable approach).  We already have what we believe is the largest database of events happening in the U.S. and 6 other countries.<p>With that data in hand, we want to make it fun and effortlessly easy to find the events that you&#x27;re interested in near you.  Our beta site launched last May and is a good start.  But there&#x27;s plenty more to do: we want to add personalized event recommendations, apps for iOS and Android, email alerts when your favorite band&#x2F;comedian&#x2F;author is coming to town, and much more.  This is a big and broad idea and will keep us busy for quite some time to come.  :)<p>We&#x27;re a 6-person startup with 2 technical cofounders, 3 engineers (2 are also data scientists) and a graphic designer.  We have team members who worked at Google and MIT Lincoln Labs and who went to MIT, Princeton and BU.  All of us work on site in Cambridge, MA.  We&#x27;re using cool technologies such as Scala, Angular and scikit-learn.<p>We&#x27;d like to add a couple more engineers to our team.
