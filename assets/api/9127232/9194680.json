Think: &quot;Moneyball&quot; meets marketing.

But whatever your background, if you can demonstrate that you&#x27;re a smart and quick-thinking data geek, I&#x27;d love to chat with you.<p>There is room for growth within the company, and I&#x27;m really excited about where our group is headed. We&#x27;re automating and standardizing processes and reporting, building predictive models, developing test methodology and analyses, and becoming a key and highly visible business partner to many groups throughout the company.\nResumes&#x2F;inquiries to brian &lt;dot&gt; &lt;last five letters of my username&gt; at PNKMAIL &lt;dot&gt; com<p>Sorry, no intern, no remote, and no H1B for the time being.","time":1426202472,"type":"comment"}
