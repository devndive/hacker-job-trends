See the official job posting here [1]. This posting is looking for people to support various International Space Station disciplines, however I personally am within the Extravehicular Activity group. I am not directly involved with hiring at all; I&#x27;m purely interested in getting more people with software development experience into my group.<p>About my job: I work at the NASA&#x27;s Neutral Buoyancy Lab (NBL)[2] and Mission Control Center (MCC)[3]. People in our group are in charge of Extravehicular Activities (spacewalks)[4], such as the one going on right now[5]. This group plans on-orbit activities, trains astronauts to perform spacewalks (at the NBL and other facilities), and assists astronauts with execution of missions from MCC. This is one of the coolest jobs on the planet. In addition to working on projects that you get to see played out in space, you get to do things like SCUBA and work in the spacesuit in the NBL.<p>While not officially part of the job posting, having a background in software would be awesome; there are huge portions of our jobs begging to be automated. For example, I&#x27;ve long wanted to improve EVA procedure building [6].<p>[1] <a href=\"https://cw.na1.hgncloud.com/sgtinc/loadJobPostingDetails.do?jobPostingID=107162&amp;source=jobList\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cw.na1.hgncloud.com&#x2F;sgtinc&#x2F;loadJobPostingDetails.do?...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_Buoyancy_Laboratory\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Neutral_Buoyancy_Laboratory</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_C._Kraft_Jr._Mission_Control_Center\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Christopher_C._Kraft_Jr._Missio...</a><p>[4] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Extravehicular_activity</a><p>[5] <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/#.VPM1YPnF-So\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nasa.gov&#x2F;multimedia&#x2F;nasatv&#x2F;#.VPM1YPnF-So</a><p>[6] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5585535\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=5585535</a>","time":1425228690,"type":"comment"}
