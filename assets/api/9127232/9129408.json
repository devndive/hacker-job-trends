(Think airbnb for private sports coaching.) We&#x27;re a venture-backed startup that&#x27;s been around for about 3 years now. We went through TechStars and MassChallenge. You&#x27;ll probably find your typical startup culture and whatnot here, but I guess one differentiating perk is you get to meet professional athletes from time to time. Julian Edelman of the Patriots came by one day, as did Nerlens Noel of the Philadelphia 76ers, and others are upcoming.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a full time Android dev to take over our Android app. Our backend is Ruby on Rails, and depending on comfort and desire you could work on the API side of things, too.<p>Hit me up for more info: gabe@coachup.com.","time":1425252638,"type":"comment"}
