We&#x27;re looking to hire senior software developers and software designers at our office in Grand Rapids.<p>A little bit about us:<p><pre><code>  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US.\n\n  - We aren&#x27;t limited to any really specific set of technologies, which is a great\n    opportunity to learn. In the past two years, I&#x27;ve worked with Python (Flask+SQLAlchemy),\n    Objective-C (and some Swift), Backbone.js (inside PhoneGap), Angular.js (with CoffeeScript),\n    QT, Node.js, and a good helping of Ruby and Rails.\n\n  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,\n    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and &gt; 40 hour weeks are\n    rare by design. Last year I worked an average of 40.408 hours per week.\n\n  - We run a makerspace in our building (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grmakers.com), which gives us\n    access to lots of cool stuff like a laser cutter and 3D printers.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love making software, and you have a couple of years of experience building\n    software with a variety of tools and technologies.\n\n  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not\n    afraid to use more. You have some experience with web or mobile tech.\n\n  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m a software developer on this awesome team.
