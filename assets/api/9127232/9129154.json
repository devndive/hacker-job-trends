On top of that, we have to provide high reliability because artifacts and dropped frames are incredibly painful for our users when they are presenting in front of hundreds of people on a big screen.<p>For more info, see <a href=\"http://prezi.com/jobs/oq2t0fwF\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;prezi.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;oq2t0fwF</a> or email me directly: laszlo.pandy at prezi dot com","time":1425248509,"type":"comment"}
