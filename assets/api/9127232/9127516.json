We&#x27;re Nilas (pronounced ny-las) and our team is building the next generation email platform, starting with beautiful APIs.<p>Developers depend on our APIs, so we have to be reliable, up all the time, and fast. We have more data for a single user than in most startups&#x27; entire database. That means big technical challenges to solve as we scale our fledgling distributed backend. We&#x27;ve also been working on a new email client, and we&#x27;re looking for product designers and front-end engineer. We&#x27;re using React, Flux, and a fork of Atom Shell. More here: <a href=\"http://www.nilas.com/blog/splitting-the-atom\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nilas.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;splitting-the-atom</a><p>== More about us ==<p>• Backend: Python, Flask, gevent, nginx, MySQL, AWS, and Debian.<p>• Frontend: Coffeescript, React, (Re)Flux, WebSQL, Atom Shell (NodeJS + Chromium)<p>• Like open source? Us too-- check it out: <a href=\"https://github.com/inboxapp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;inboxapp</a><p>• We&#x27;re 40% women on our team of 13 (12 engineers), including 1 of 2 cofounders. We want to make that number 50%.<p>• Our sunny Mission office is more lived-in than tidy. Think art studio, not corporate. Our team is more likely to end up in Yosemite or on a bike ride together than drinking at the latest startup event.<p>• We have a flexible vacation policy and value personal responsibility and ownership. Benefits include full health, dental, vision, commuter, and lunch at the office every day. Some remote work &#x2F; work-from-home is OK too.<p>Apply at <a href=\"https://www.nilas.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nilas.com&#x2F;jobs</a> and mention HN. We love it when candidates let us know what draws them to the job, and we encourage applications from women, LQBTQ folks, and people of colour.<p>Some recent press: <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/27/next-gen-email-platform-nilas-previously-inbox-grabs-8-million-preps-its-own-email-client/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;27&#x2F;next-gen-email-platform-nil...</a>","time":1425225715,"type":"comment"}
