We&#x27;ve also built out PTO tracking, some reporting&#x2F;analytics features and a B2B payments feature. We aren&#x27;t just about payroll.<p>We are a PEO, which means we coemploy our customers employees (similar to Trinet&#x2F;Ambrose or ADP Total Source, if you&#x27;ve ever heard of those). Because of that we&#x27;re able to do a lot of really cool things including offer health insurance at a massive discount, as well as bring many other benefits traditionally reserved for large companies to startups and SMBs. We&#x27;re growing very quickly (35-40% month over month) and just raised a $6mm series A from Thrive, Index, a few others[1]. Our founders are former Amazon, Etsy and Groupon executives who have had successful startups in the past.\nWe handle payments and lots of very sensitive information (bank numbers, social security numbers etc.) so we need people who are comfortable working in that environment. Basically we&#x27;re looking for senior level engineers to help build the foundation for a really awesome engineering org. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions (will@justworks.com). We&#x27;re also hiring in sales.\n<a href=\"http://www.justworks.com/careers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justworks.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a><p>Full time in NYC only, no contractors, no remotes, sorry.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/10/09/justworks-raises-6-million-to-help-businesses-handle-employee-benefits/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.wsj.com&#x2F;venturecapital&#x2F;2014&#x2F;10&#x2F;09&#x2F;justworks-rai...</a>","time":1425225707,"type":"comment"}
