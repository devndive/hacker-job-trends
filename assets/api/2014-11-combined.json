The tech stack will be a mix of Python, Scala and various JS MVC framework. What&#x27;s special about the position, IMHO is that our team has a direct working relationship with scientists in the lab (no biz-analysts in between), specifically supporting one lab where the mission is to develop novel genome sequencing techniques (e.g., pac-bio, nanopore sequencing) and another lab whose purpose is to sequence and analyze genomes of infectious disease pathogens (e.g., tuberculosis). So think no morning standup&#x27;s, &quot;tyranny of agile&quot; but more an ad-hoc academic environment where you&#x27;ll communicate &amp; work with biologists, have an opportunity to learn both the wet-lab and in silico process of genome sequencing&#x2F;assembly&#x2F;annotation, go to all the talks and workshops for different research groups, have ownership over the architecting, coding and dev-ops.<p>So if you&#x27;re interested in writing software without the management overhead of a traditional software org, be involved in Bioinformatics research, it might be a good opportunity for you to consider.<p>Organization-wise, the Broad is not a tech startup, but a genomics research institute that&#x27;s half-way between industry and academia; computational biology is a big deal here and background of a lot the scientist-users.<p><a href=\"https://www2.apply2jobs.com/BroadInstitute/ProfExt/index.cfm?fuseaction=mExternal.showJob&amp;RID=1506&amp;CurrentPage=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.apply2jobs.com&#x2F;BroadInstitute&#x2F;ProfExt&#x2F;index.cfm...</a>","time":1414871305,"type":"comment"},{"by":"jsaxton86","id":8543604,"kids":[8559655,8543936,8544155,8545291],"parent":8542892,"text":"Has anyone had success with this lately?

New York City. Sunnyvale.\nJob Title: Application Security Consultant<p>Have you ever seen the 1992 film Sneakers?  Near the start, we see Martin Bishop (Robert Redford) close out a bank account, and take the proceeds to the managers.  He pretty tersely says something like:<p>&quot;Gentlemen, your communication lines are vulnerable. \n\tFire exits need to be monitored. \n\tYour rent-a-cops are a tad undertrained. \n\tOutside of that, everything seems to be fine. \n\tYou&#x27;ll get our full report in a few days. But first, who&#x27;s got my check?&quot;&quot;<p>Cut to a bank secretary, writing Martin a check.<p>&quot;So, people hire you to break into their places...\n              ...to make sure no one can break into their places?&quot;<p>Whenever I&#x27;m asked to explain what we do at Matasano, this scene comes to mind.  Our work is the digital equivalent; breaking applications so they can be made stronger and more resilient to attack, inoculating the world&#x27;s software like a binary flu shot.<p>Modern applications are a lot like the bank in the movie.  Authentication protects the front door, much like the bank&#x27;s cameras and guards.  Encryption often protects sensitive data, similar to how steel lined walls protect a bank vault.  Communication protocols convey information in and out, like armored cars ferrying cash to and fro.  Finding the application&#x27;s &#x27;communication lines&#x27;, &#x27;fire exits&#x27;, and &#x27;rent-a-cops&#x27; is our goal.  As Application Security Consultants we seek the overlooked, the neglected, the unexpected flaws in an application&#x27;s code.  Like Martin, we show how these weaknesses can lead to overall failure of the application, and we do this so it can be improved.<p>Later in the movie, Cosmo (Ben Kingsley), a villainous ex-con says:\n\t&quot;The world isn&#x27;t run by weapons anymore, or energy, or money. It&#x27;s run by little ones and zeroes, little bits of data. It&#x27;s all just electrons.&quot;\nIn 1992, that might&#x27;ve been hyperbolic but it&#x27;s becoming more true every day.<p>If being part of ensuring the systems we all rely on continue to function safely and reliably, we should talk.  If working with smart people on the cutting edge of technology excites you, we should talk.  If diving deeply into a wide variety of technologies and facing new challenges daily appeals to you, we should talk.  If tearing apart application code and making it do things that its creators didn&#x27;t intend is fun for you, we should talk.<p>You can get a taste for the sorts of things we do at www.microcorruption.com and www.cryptopals.com.<p>Reach out to us at careers@matasano.com or by visiting our web site.","time":1414860323,"type":"comment"},{"by":"clarkevans","id":8543058,"parent":8542892,"text":"Software Engineer at Prometheus Research (New Haven, CT &amp; Telecommute)<p>Prometheus Research builds open source RexDB (<a href=\"http://www.rexdb.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rexdb.org</a>) software, and delivers custom applications to help medical researchers organize complex data.

We’re bringing data driven decision making and analytics to an industry that’s been around about as long as human civilization.<p>Given the breadth of the system, &quot;Full Stack&quot; is probably an understatement so we’re calling it a Full Stack+ until we come up with something better. Our system involves wearable devices, field deployed base stations and radios, cloud servers, standard browser front ends. It could possibly end up with Unity native frontends, feedback through the wearables, more sensors for inanimate objects, radio analysis, etc. We will be looking into bringing in additional data from existing APIs around the web as well as some more interesting places, i.e. let’s make a crane talk to our servers.<p>You will have the opportunity to work with a variety of databases, embedded systems, web, native, and embedded user-interfaces, and more. Clearly one developer is not going to know every language and technology we end up using from day one. This means that there will be a lot of learning on the job and plenty of room for influencing architecture and technology choices.<p>About the Environment<p>We have one developer (the guy writing this) and one hardware engineer (the CEO) at the moment so you will be joining a very early team. Our customers are companies and there are a bunch of wonderful folks working on the business side getting us very impressive partners and interesting sites to beta test and develop the product with.<p>We will be handling very high volumes of data very early on and so the quality threshold of certain parts will be higher than that of most early stage systems.

Great! We&#x27;ll likely be using a lot of that.\nThis means you don&#x27;t mind reading docs and source code and learning quickly.\nVersion control is a must. We use Git.<p>Important Non-tech Factors<p>You live in NYC or would if the job is interesting enough.\nAn experimental mindset and a curiosity for all tech interesting.\nGood communications skills and personal accountability are a must.\nWhen things go wrong, tell people and fix them.\nAs the team expands we will do some light code-review to mitigate the bus-factor.\nExperience working in a startup is a plus.<p>Technical Nice-to-Haves (not required in any sense but might come in handy&#x2F;be interesting)<p>Working with&#x2F;messing around with Unity or other gaming&#x2F;3D engines.\nPrior experience with Arduino&#x2F;other hardware prototyping.\nExperience with hardware&#x2F;EE.\nFamiliarity with Machine Learning.<p>Don&#x27;t hit all the bullet points?

It inspired me to rethink the whole way we normally post a job. When looking for skilled likeminded people to join our team we shouldn’t make a job post; rather we should make a “company pitch”. Most job posts are dictating who you are and what you should do – a common sentence in a job post often goes like this: “you got a master degree in computer science and like to...” or “you will develop solution concepts by using...”. We don’t believe in such requirements. We don’t think of you as a work unit in a production line. Rather we seek talents and personalities whom we would want to invest in a relationship with. We firmly believe modern companies need to rethink the way in which they attract similar minded people. We must open our door and introduce our values; as this is the first step towards creating a bond. After all we are the team that want you to join us.<p>With that being said welcome to 3QAYJ.com (www.3QAYJ.com) – our company pitch project to attract you!<p>Our workflow is managed via<p>JIRA,CONFLUENCE<p>and all code submitting is handled through Github, pull request.

Starting from 2015 we will have a real life team summit meeting some place around the world financed by the company.<p>We are currently looking at expanding our development team with 1-2 backend developers.<p>Job description<p>Here is a list of some of the tools and technologize we currently use:<p>- Nginx<p>- git<p>- Capistrano<p>- compass (scss)<p>- coffeescript (a little bit)<p>We&#x27;d appreciate if you have experience with the above or you can study how to use it.<p>We appreciate if you have:<p>- skills in Magento development<p>- skills in web development in general<p>- skills or at least wants to get skills in mobile applications development (Android&#x2F;iOS)<p>Good confirmations of your professionalism could be:<p>- your github account with contributions to open source projects<p>- any certificates (Magento MCD&#x2F;MCDP, ZCE and so on)<p>- your stackoverflow account<p>If applying we would ask you to send us an example of code written by you and make a short pair programming session with one of our developers.<p>What we offer<p>- Long term full employment<p>- Flexible working hours<p>- Remote job - Work from your home<p>- Influence in all aspect of your work – freedom in ways to resolve tasks<p>- Respect your opinion&#x2F; support your own projects<p>- Stability and personal relationship<p>- Fully paid Team summit meeting each year.<p>Your Application<p>We hope you wish to join our team.

Help us change that at Clever (YC S12)<p>There’s a lot of great educational software out there - think Oregon Trail, Math Blasters, and Carmen Sandiego - but teachers can’t use it in schools.  Teachers would love to use programs like these, but synchronizing data between their school’s database and external software applications is a huge problem that results in wasted time at the start of class and frustrated, bored students… which leads to software being abandoned entirely.  80% of K-12 teachers would use more software in classes if getting students logged in weren’t such a hassle, and a quarter of all class time that’s supposed to be dedicated to software is wasted on logins alone.<p>Developers have a similar problem: they love clean APIs, but in the education industry, they haven’t had one.  Most K-12 schools house their student data in ancient legacy databases that make integrations a nightmare.  If you’re a five-person startup and you’ve built an app that revolutionizes the way third-graders learn fractions, there’s simply no way to get your product in front of students.<p>Clever (YC S12 - clever.com) is solving these problems by building a modern, developer-friendly API for schools… which we give them for free.  Developers love being able to plug into schools without having to write a complex integration for every single district they’re working with, so they pay us for access to the platform.  This business model has helped us grow quickly; we’re now in 1 in 5 schools in America (over 30,000 schools), and our product is used by millions of students every day.<p>Our goal is to become the education identity company.  The first step in that direction is our Instant Login single sign-on platform: a universal login that allows students to access all of their learning applications in one place.  (This is a big deal if you’ve ever seen a second-grader try to manage fifteen different usernames and passwords.)<p>Right now we’re a team of 40 people (17 engineers) based in downtown San Francisco.  We’re looking for full-stack engineers who can hack in Node, Go, and Python (or are willing to learn), but more importantly, we’re looking for people who share our passion for improving education.  If you’re interested, we’d love to hear from you.<p>Other stuff we like:\n-Tech talks.  Every other Tuesday, we do “Clever Talks” during lunch where one of us will give a presentation on anything he&#x2F;she’s interested in.  Recent talks have covered exoplanets, neuroscience, hacking big-company customer service interactions, and what’s wrong with American high school history education.\n-Bughouse chess.

We (WeSpire) are looking for a Senior Rails Engineer.<p>Guess What? That developer could be you!<p>If you&#x27;ve ever wanted to work with a world-class team on a brand new type of product that is being used for good in some of the biggest companies in the world, this could be your chance.<p>### What does WeSpire do?<p>WeSpire gets people to do things that matter, and measures the impact. We use behavior change models to design interactions that encourage people to act differently. Then we measure the delta in their actions, analyze the real-world impact, and display the information back to the user. We started in the sustainability space, and now work for many different applications, including volunteering, diversity, and happiness at work.<p>### What will I work on?<p>#### 1: Design Implementation<p>You will take designs from our product team, and turn them into working features.<p>You will work in one of two modes: prototype mode or production mode.<p>Sometimes, you will build code to last the next 4 years.<p>Sometimes you will build experiments to last the next 4 weeks.<p>You will know the difference between prototype mode and production mode and be comfortable working either way, because we are building solutions that are entirely new, and there isn&#x27;t a ton of known art, so we end up figuring out many things from scratch! (This should excite you)<p>#### 2: Writing Code<p>When you are writing code you will understand how people will use it, and you will know how to make things intuitive for them. You will also know when to raise the alarm because a feature doesn&#x27;t fully make sense and will confuse people.<p>Sometimes you will write every part of the feature, from CSS to JS to Ruby to SQL.<p>Sometimes you will split those responsibilities with a coworker.<p>Either way, you will be phenomenal at Ruby and SQL, good at JS, and at least passable at CSS.<p>#### 3: Writing Tests<p>You will write tests that will give you confidence about the behavior of your methods, of your objects, and of the system as a whole. From these tests, you will design code that is object-oriented, and interfaces between objects that are clear and reduce coupling. You will care about the readability, reusability, and performance of your code, and usually in that order.<p>#### 4: Working with Developers<p>You will:<p>* Work with developers who are similarly obsessed with good design and strong tests\n* Care about your coworkers and be invested in their success as well as your own\n* Be a leader in code quality while reviewing code, while mentoring other developers and defining best practices\n* Re-architect major portions of our application, as we rapidly outgrow our current architecture\n* Push the team to select the right technologies to meet our performance, maintenance, and code quality standards<p>### What technologies will I work with?<p>* Rails 4.1+\n* Ruby 2.1+\n* Postgres\n* Redis\n* Resque\n* SASS\n* Coffeescript\n* jQuery\n* HAML\n* Git\n* Github\n* Heroku\n* Slack<p>### OK, but will I actually like working at WeSpire?<p>We think so. If you like tackling difficult problems and working with smart people, you&#x27;ll feel right at home here. On top of that, we work hard to make sure the company culture is strong and welcoming, and that the work arrangements are flexible enough to work for you.<p>Here are some of the things that we do:<p>* Work from home Fridays. Pretty much everyone in the company works from home. It saves emissions, which fits with our sustainability roots, and it&#x27;s nice to have a day to work from your couch.\n* Flexibility on working from home other days too. You will like working from the office, and interacting with your coworkers, but if you have to work from home some day, it&#x27;s not a big deal.\n* &quot;Wine Wednesdays&quot; to bring the entire company together over some drinks\n* &quot;Meat-free Mondays&quot; with a chef-prepared vegetarian lunch for the whole company every Monday!\n* The entire company does an outing together at least twice a year. Previous outings: a scavenger hunt through the streets of Boston and Cambridge, a boat trip to a Boston Harbor Island, and a trip to Hopsters to brew our company beers.\n* Speaking of, we brewed our own company beers, a Belgian Quad and a Double IPA. They&#x27;re not too shabby, if we do say so ourselves.<p>### Compensation<p>Cash comp paired with equity — we are looking for the best and will pay them accordingly. Health coverage and dental benefits, 401k plan. The opportunity for growth in a fast-paced progressive company is yours for the taking.<p>### To Apply<p>Please send a link to projects you are proud of, a resume or LinkedIn profile and your quick thoughts on what’s extremely interesting to you about using technology to inspire positive actions to kim [at] wespire [dot] com.","time":1414872730,"type":"comment"},{"by":"boyd","id":8543861,"parent":8542892,"text":"One Codex (YC S14) – Genomic search and data platform.

Our first application area is pathogen detection – working with doctors, epidemiologists, and public health officials to identify and characterize the bacteria and viruses that threaten our health. And already, we’ve attracted users at many of the top public health and research organizations across the globe.<p>===============<p>==== About You ====<p>===============<p>We’re looking for talented software engineers to help us build towards our vision for a global genomics data network and enable widespread <i>in</i> <i>silico</i> diagnostics. Specifically, we’re interested in folks with a passion for and depth of experience in one or more of the following areas:<p>1) Full Stack Engineering: We will be building everything from developer-facing APIs to easy-to-use end applications for doctors and public health officials. You care about everything from elegant APIs to compelling data visualizations. Python experience preferred (we currently use Flask for our web backend).<p>2) Distributed Systems: We’re building systems for organizing and indexing billions to trillions of genomic fingerprints across the entire tree of life. You’re passionate about data structures, efficient computational solutions, and distributed systems (and don’t mind the occasional bit twiddling). We’ve built some cool initial tech in C, Nimrod, and Python (probabilistic data structures, Docker pipelines for reliably running bioinformatics workflows, etc.), and are excited about the extensive greenfield opportunities here.<p>3) Genomics &#x2F; Computational Biology: We are tackling hard problems at the intersection of microbiology, genomics, statistics, and computer science. You have research experience or another strong connection to these fields, understand current bioinformatics tools and approaches (and their limits), and have worked extensively with next-generation sequencing data. Ideally, you also have some intuitions and strong hypotheses about how bioinformatics tools can scale for petabyte-sized reference sets.<p>===<p>You’ll be one of our earliest hires and directly shape our technology choices, product, and business.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We just got back from Portugal...where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http://we.are.expensify.com/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com&#x2F;apply</a>).
