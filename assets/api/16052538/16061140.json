MF broke ground in 2014 with the world&#x27;s first continuous carbon fiber 3D printer, and this year with the world&#x27;s first sub-$100K metal printer. Currently MF has 4 software engineers and is looking for a few more.<p>Software stack:<p>* Webapp - Express.js &#x2F; AWS backend, AngularJS &#x2F; WebGL frontend, Electron for optional desktop client, all sanely-linted CoffeeScript<p>* Computational geometry engine for part slicing - Written from scratch in CoffeeScript and C++. Runs on EC2, in-browser, or on desktop client<p>* Printer touchscreen application - Node Webkit &#x2F; AngularJS + Python -&gt; migrating to Electron &#x2F; VueJS + Python, all on top of a custom Debian image on a BeagleBone<p>* Printer firmware - embedded C on a custom board<p>Them team is all full-stack. Software tasks are generally distributed based on individual interest. You will have tons of project ownership. Your ideas will influence the company&#x27;s direction. You will do interdisciplinary work on physical systems and learn from best-of-the-best engineers across MatSci, Mech-E, EE, and SW, mostly MIT grads.<p>To succeed here, you need to be a quick learner and have a passion for software engineering. You don&#x27;t need prior experience with 3D printing or our software stack, you can pick up those skills on the job.<p>Email jstrauss (then an at) markforged.com or apply <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;markforged&#x2F;6cd283d8-0926-4e81-8e7c-636dfd683527\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;markforged&#x2F;6cd283d8-0926-4e81-8e7c-636...</a>","time":1514989324,"type":"comment"}
