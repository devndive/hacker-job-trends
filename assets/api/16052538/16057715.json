You&#x27;ve probably heard of us. Although it’s a large organization it’s made up of lots of small product teams. We are a 2-pizza team building a new AWS product we are going to be launching later this year. We need a few more folks to help us launch. Unfortunately we’re pretty secretive about new products so we can’t share too many details about the product with you yet. What we can say is that we&#x27;re part of the AI division and, as you might guess from the job title, the product involves web technologies. We expect this product to have a huge impact on the entire AWS ecosystem.<p>In your role you’ll focus on building our web app, but you’ll be expected to act like a startup member and participate in every aspect of creating a great product. That includes innovating, designing, prototyping, developing, testing, deploying and operating this new AWS product. You’ll learn about Amazon’s peculiar culture and internal processes. Our web app is built using common web technology including React&#x2F;Redux&#x2F;GraphQL, and Webpack.<p>Our team is split between Seattle, WA and Vancouver, BC. You can choose to work in either place. Work Hard, Have Fun, Make History.<p>Feel free to reach out to me at vikhyak@amazon.com if you have any questions.
