We also automatically identify if a quotation came from a source that should be cited and walk the student through creating that citation.\nWe accomplish this through a close collaboration with our team of Data Scientists to deploy online-learning models.\nChegg is a fantastic place to work. We&#x27;re small (~800 employees) and we&#x27;re public ($CHGG). The business is booming, so it&#x27;s an excellent time to join.\nPlease drop me a line if you&#x27;d like to learn more: btucker@chegg.com (I&#x27;m Ben Tucker, Director of Engineering for Writing Tools)","time":1514952135,"type":"comment"}
