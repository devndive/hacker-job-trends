We invent and build advanced aircraft of all sizes, with particular focus on flight autonomy. Our current projects include small quad autonomy, flying car (eVTOL), solar aircraft, advanced high-speed VTOL plane, robotic copilot, and many others. We build complete flight software stacks, from low level flight controls through high-level autonomy and sensor fusion algorithms.<p>We are looking for experienced software engineers to help us turn cutting edge ideas into prototypes at our Cambridge R&amp;D office. Most of our early prototype work is in C++ and Python, while more mature and safety-critical projects use a mix of C++ and Simulink&#x2F;Stateflow with an in-house toolchain. We use both ROS and DDS, and target both x86 and embedded ARM platforms running either a lightweight OS or bare metal on custom boards. Our fast prototype projects are run on GitLab, while safety-critical projects use heavy-weight auditable tools: DOORS, SVN, Trac, Collaborator, and Jenkins.<p>If you want your work to be in next generation of flying vehicles, if you are passionate about flight, and if you know how to design and implement clean, real-time and highly reliable&#x2F;resilient software for embedded platforms, please send me an email at software_engineers@aurora.aero, or apply via the web site to one of our open positions.","time":1514924316,"type":"comment"}
