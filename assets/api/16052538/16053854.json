The need has never been greater for technology that informs and protects the public. Citizen empowers communities to keep each other safe and informed. Citizen is backed by Sequoia Capital and Founder’s Fund, and is a top 10 global News App on the App Store.<p>We’re looking for passionate, hardworking, mission-driven people to help take the Citizen app to the next level and launch multiple cities in 2018. Our New York City office is the center of our operation, and the hub of all engineering and product activities.<p>---<p>Some of the problem spaces we work in today:<p>Scaling: We have one of the fastest growing organic user bases in NYC, and right now we’re geo-restricted to New York City and San Francisco. Soon we will launch nation-wide and we need to support that scale. A Citizen international launch will follow.<p>Bursting: Without warning, a major incident occurs and multiple users begin live-streaming video into the app. We notify the entire user base, causing a massive burst of simultaneously connected clients. The core systems we build need to efficiently support traffic that can grow to hundreds of thousands of concurrent users today, and millions in the future.<p>---<p>We&#x27;re hiring across all engineering disciplines.
