We focus primarily on Ethereum, Tezos and IPFS for building out the infrastructure needed for seamlessly creating scalable, resilient and functional applications to let people and communities gain ownership over their identities, information and finances through decentralization and disintermediation.<p>The decentralized applications engineer will work with multiple languages on projects relating to blockchain infrastructure, user interfaces and decentralized systems across the full stack of software development. They will need to quickly pick up new technologies in a fast-moving domain. All of Cryptonomic&#x27;s code is written in the functional programming paradigm, with some components explicitly requiring it, so the qualified candidate must already be acquainted with functional languages or be receptive to picking them up. Some examples of the work involved include: \n- Writing a blockchain analysis tool in Scala and JavaScript \n- Learning and integrating new blockchain platforms from scratch. \n- Writing peer-to-peer financial smart contracts in various smart contract languages. \n- Building autonomous decentralized applications over multiple platforms. \n- Potentially working on mission-critical, formally-verified systems<p>Apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;cryptonomic&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;313560-software-engineer-for-decentralized-applications\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;cryptonomic&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;313560-software-engineer-f...</a> or email info at cryptonomic dot tech.","time":1514928337,"type":"comment"}
