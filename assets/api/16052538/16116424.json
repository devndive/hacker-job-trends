We handle transcoding, packaging, delivery, and playback for billions of video streams every month. We&#x27;re looking for smart, passionate developers who want to work on projects that touch millions at a company that is still small enough that their contribution can have a real impact.<p>We have positions open right now for backend and full-stack developers. You&#x27;ll be working on a small, self-organized team that is expected to understand their customers, and design, build, deploy, and operate their own solutions. Teams choose their own languages and tools but we tend towards kotlin&#x2F;java on the backend and node.js&#x2F;javascript&#x2F;react for frontend work. We&#x27;re ambitious but don&#x27;t think that means compromising a real work-life balance. Visa sponsorship possible for the right candidates.<p>* Backend developer: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;tu8jq61\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;tu8jq61</a>\n* Full-stack developer: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;nycrtd1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;nycrtd1</a>","time":1515602550,"type":"comment"}
