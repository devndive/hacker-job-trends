India - Gurgaon<p>S&amp;P Global is hiring functional programmers at various levels and locations in US and India. No Remote.<p>We are the Analytics Product Development Team, a relatively small group of developers focused on building next generation financial models and applications that leverage S&amp;P&#x27;s world-class data sets. Last year we launched a re-imagined Portfolio Analytics product that helps investment managers of all types measure the efficacy of their investment strategies and identify areas of risk in their equity portfolios. Put your FP skills to use as we move on to multiple asset classes, intraday analytics, and strategy modeling.<p>Functional Programming has a relatively long history here at S&amp;P Global. We build our back-end data calculation engine using purely-functional Scala in 2008 and have been building new models and expanding it ever since. We created Ermine, a Haskell-like language featuring row types that can run on the JVM.  Ermine drives our templating, reporting, and database access, adding type-safety to user-generated layouts. The new Portfolio Analytics is a single page web application that makes extensive use of PureScript. All of this co-exists in a diverse tech ecosystem that includes the JVM, .NET, and SQL Server.<p>We have a few open positions, so we are looking for developers with varying levels of experience. Ideal candidates have FP experience, but we&#x27;d still like to talk with you if you are just getting started with FP and are looking to grow. Please email resumes or questions to smcfarland@spglobal.com.<p>Gurgaon candidates, please email anupam_jain@spglobal.com and apply here -<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spgi.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com&#x2F;SPGI_Careers&#x2F;job&#x2F;Gurgaon-Haryana-IN&#x2F;Software--Developer--II_233622-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spgi.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com&#x2F;SPGI_Careers&#x2F;job&#x2F;Gurgaon-...</a>.","time":1514997804,"type":"comment"}
