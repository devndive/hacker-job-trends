NIMBLE is a tool for writing hierarchical statistical models and algorithms from R, with compilation via code-generated C++.  Major methods currently include MCMC and sequential Monte Carlo, which users can customize and extend.  More information can be found at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;R-nimble.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;R-nimble.org</a>.  Currently we seek someone with experience in computational statistical methods such as MCMC and excellent software development skills in R and C++.  This could be someone with relevant experience in computational statistics and software engineering. Alternatively, it could be someone with a Ph.D. in Statistics, Computer Science, or an applied statistical field in which they have done relevant work. The scope of work can include both core development of NIMBLE and development and application of innovative methods using NIMBLE, with specific focus depending on the background of the successful candidate.  Applicants must have either a Ph.D. in a relevant field or have a proven record of relevant work.  Please send cover letter, CV, and the names and contact information for three references to nimble.stats@gmail.com.  Applications will be considered on a rolling basis starting 30 January, 2018.","time":1515003140,"type":"comment"}
