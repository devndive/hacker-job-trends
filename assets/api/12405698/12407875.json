We work together in SF and are growing rapidly.<p>Binti&#x27;s main SaaS web product is a conventional monolithic Rails&#x2F;Postgres app that delivers value in heaps and heaps, and remains super fun to hack on. We&#x27;re building the monolith up higher and higher, and looking forward to soon chipping off a service or two (perhaps in Elixir?). Specific engineering roles we have open are for someone that is highly-opinionated on the front-end stack&#x2F;practices, a security specialist, and a UX&#x2F;a11y specialist. We&#x27;re using Kubernetes&#x2F;Google Cloud.<p>Contact info is in my profile.","time":1472755811,"type":"comment"}
