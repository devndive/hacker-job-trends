Our system matches users with hundreds of possible opportunities in real-time. Needless to say, we&#x27;re looking for people who care about performance. A lot. Our back-end systems are written in C#, Java using Redis, Mongo, and SQLServer. You might know C# or Java or you might not, but either way you&#x27;re willing to learn. Regardless, you can impress us in your language of choice. You understand algorithms matter. You also understand sloppy database access could make that ugly n^2 algorithm look absolutely blazing fast.\nYou love to code. You&#x27;ve built stuff. Stuff you can show us. Stuff you can&#x27;t wait to show us. You know the right technology implemented the right way matters.\nWe&#x27;re looking for both Senior and Junior back-end engineers. If you&#x27;re a Senior Engineer - you&#x27;ve worked in server-side code for a few years. You&#x27;ve scaled to thousands or maybe millions of users.\nIf you&#x27;re a Junior engineer, you love to code and you&#x27;re good at it. You&#x27;re smart, You&#x27;re passionate, and most of all you can&#x27;t wait to get started. (New grads please apply!)<p>Front-end Engineers:\nYou know Javascript. You know the ins, the outs and how to make it blazing fast. You care about performance because you know your users are waiting for every line of your code. You&#x27;ve used some popular frameworks, maybe angular or react - but you know one or more cold.<p>Where we are:<p>Charlotte, NC. If you&#x27;re into great weather and a central location (our airport is an American hub) you should check us out. You can pick great urban living (Uptown&#x27;s 4th ward is the place to be) or get yourself a huge house (at reasonable prices) in the burbs. The standard of living for an engineer doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.","time":1472743721,"type":"comment"}
