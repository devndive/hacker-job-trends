See, there’s this company that is ripe for displacement. They put out software that everyone uses but nobody loves. We think we can do it better. Much better. We can make it easy-to-use, more powerful, and massively scalable &#x2F; highly available by putting it in the cloud. Just like Gmail supplanted Exchange, we want to disrupt (yes, we said it) the Directory server market.<p>Who are we? We’re the scrappy underdog with the backing of serious VCs and the experience of a crack team of founders and engineers with decades of identity and Security experience.<p>Who are we looking for? Comrades in arms to fight the entrenched opposition. People who want to seriously change Identity and Directory Management. We’re funded, we’re in downtown Boulder, and we’re making a big difference. Get in here and be a part of it!<p>Stack: Postgres&#x2F;Mongo&#x2F;Redis, NodeJS&#x2F;Golang, Docker&#x2F;Saltstack<p>Contact: jobs@jumpcloud.com","time":1472745783,"type":"comment"}
