Our public site is powered by Django and the Django-REST-framework - we also use Pandas, Numpy and Jupyter for analysis and forecasting.<p>We use AWS heavily, employing most of the &quot;Hashistack&quot; (eg Packer, Consul, Terraform, Atlas) as part of a continuous deployment pipeline. See, for example, <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.octopus.energy&#x2F;2016&#x2F;05&#x2F;05&#x2F;django-elb-health-checks.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.octopus.energy&#x2F;2016&#x2F;05&#x2F;05&#x2F;django-elb-health-chec...</a><p>Client-side, we use React and SASS; our mobile apps are built using React Native.<p>Engineering standards are high. All code is well tested and thoroughly reviewed.<p>This is a great opportunity for several reasons:<p>* We have lots of difficult <i>design</i> challenges to solve. The UK energy market is complicated, dated and process-heavy - there&#x27;s an awful lot of domain modelling that we need to get right.<p>* We have difficult <i>technical</i> problems to solve. With the advent of smart meters, we&#x27;ll soon be processing millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption.<p>* There&#x27;s a great opportunity for disruption in the UK energy market. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not exactly popular. The energy landscape is changing as we move to more disaggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology.<p>* You&#x27;ll be working for a company that is helping to tackle climate change. We&#x27;ll be helping move people onto using greener technology and consuming energy from renewable sources. This will all help transition the UK towards a lower carbon future.<p>Apply via talent@octopus.energy","time":1472825108,"type":"comment"}
