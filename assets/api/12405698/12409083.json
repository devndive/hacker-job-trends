We&#x27;re a small team and wear many hats. While we&#x27;re actively seeking junior positions (1-3 years of experience), we encourage qualified mid- and senior-level candidates to apply as well. We have a strong preference for local candidates but can help with Visa sponsorship for the right person if needed.<p>We are looking for:<p>1. Data Analysts and Engineers: Python, R, PostgreSQL, MySQL, ELK, and Spark, but we&#x27;re not married to any particular stack. We want you to work in whatever way is most effective. Must be comfortable working with messy, disaggregated data sets and have a strong grasp of ETL and data preparation. Bonus points for D3 and an interest in turning data into something beautiful and engaging.<p>2. Business Analysts and Strategists: Excel, PowerPoint, Word (and cloud equivalents). Some experience with analytics tools and basic scripting is helpful but not required. This person will help shape the strategy and direction of current and future projects in a way that moves the needle.<p>Looking ahead to the coming weeks and months, we&#x27;re also interested in a DBA&#x2F;Architect, a systems engineer (with some exposure to distributed systems -- technologies we use include Hadoop, HDFS, Avro, Spark, Kafka, and Flume), a project manager, data engineers, scientists, and developers.<p>If any of the above sounds interesting, please drop a resume, github profile, sample work, or anything else you think might be interesting to datajobs [at] olympicchannel.com.","time":1472765674,"type":"comment"}
