At Numeric, we&#x27;re looking for Python people to help build, test and deploy the whole trading pipeline.<p>If you have experience in building systematic trading systems, or if you&#x27;re interested in learning, we&#x27;d love to hear from you. We do friendly code review for knowledge sharing, and we also support staff in getting qualifications.<p>We have all the benefits of being an established, successful hedge fund but the developer team is still small enough to do a single standup in the morning. We have the best of both worlds.<p>Interested? Drop me an email at wilfred.hughes@man.com, and mention HN.","time":1472782172,"type":"comment"}
