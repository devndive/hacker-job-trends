We think, create, and market our own apps. We&#x27;re young (3 years of activity, average age 27 years old), but we&#x27;ve achieved explosive growth: the apps that we&#x27;ve invented, developed, and published have been downloaded more than 40 million times, and millions of people use them every week. We are currently looking for a QA Tester and for exceptional Software Engineers to join our team of backend and iOS engineers. Our backend stack consists for the most part of Python, node.js, MongoDB, and Redis. Our iOS work is every bit as extensive and challenging as the backend one, if not more.<p>We pursue extreme flexibility, and this requires everyone to be able to morph and adapt to new roles as needed. Hence, you may be exposed to a number of other areas, such as App Store and data analysis, UX and UI design, and several more. We’ll teach you what you don’t know, as long as you’re eager to learn it.<p>More information and application form at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bendingspoons.com&#x2F;careers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bendingspoons.com&#x2F;careers.html</a> (Please mention that you found out about us on HN in your cover letter.)","time":1472750028,"type":"comment"}
