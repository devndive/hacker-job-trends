We help businesses to create and share schedules with hourly workers. To do this, we have built complex workflows into web applications for both managers and workers. We were apart of the first YC Fellowship class last Fall, and now we are a 4-person team based in Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf. We just opened up a position for a scrappy, self-starting marketing professional to build our brand equity from the ground up.<p>Our tech stack is primarily Go, React&#x2F;Redux, Kubernetes, Bazel, and some Python.
