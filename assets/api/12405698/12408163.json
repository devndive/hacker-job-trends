You will be responsible for entire features and will be a full member of the CareMessage Engineering team. Our team believes in an Agile development environment, test driven development. Our tools of choice are Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, PostgreSQL, and we place an emphasis on open collaboration and ownership. We&#x27;re using Protractor for automated frontend testing so knowledge in that is a plus. When something isn’t working, we’re not afraid to throw it out and try something new - so if you have exciting ideas about the QA process and how to make your own job even easier, you’ll fit right in. All of our developers and QA engineers are working from a remote location.<p>Apply here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;lt3wim\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;lt3wim</a>","time":1472758032,"type":"comment"}
