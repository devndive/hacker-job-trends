Crafting a sleek, intuitive front-end?  Evangelizing a breakthrough approach to network intelligence? This is your opportunity to get involved in a dynamic, rapidly growing San Francisco-based startup.<p>Kentik Technologies is the creator of Kentik Detect, a big data SaaS for network traffic visibility, DDoS detection, and infrastructure optimization. Accessible via web portal, psql client, and API, Kentik Detect is the network visibility solution that our founders — former network operators from Akamai, Netflix, YouTube, and CloudFlare — always wanted but could never find. It lets network operators see complete traffic paths, find root causes for link congestion, reduce costs by peering with other networks, and know immediately when their networks are under DDoS attack.<p>In our first 12 months on the market we&#x27;ve landed 70+ customers including:<p>Shopify, Pandora, DailyMotion, Yelp, Box, Neustar, Instart Logic, and Cisco&#x2F;OpenDNS.<p>On the backend we&#x27;re looking for folks with real-world experience building distributed systems in Go&#x2F;C&#x2F;C++. On the front end we need experts at both client- and server-side JavaScript, with broad experience in monitoring, visualization, and building state-of-the-art Web applications. And in sales we need proven performers with a track record in highly technical markets (network-related preferred).<p>Sound like a good fit?
