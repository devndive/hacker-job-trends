The oldest photographs in Getty’s image catalog have literally been for sale since 1920 - so boring.<p>By crafting a mobile experience that allows photographers to get inspired, gain a following and get exposure, as well as sell some of their work, we’ve grown to a massive community of 250,000 photographers, and we’ve got big brands using our photos: Google, Uber, Viacom, and Birchbox, to name a few.<p>Our values? We are guided by our mission and steered by metrics. We focus on the one thing that matters today. Along with a strong bias for speed and learning, we strive for excellence and elegance. We believe in being open and honest with one another. We believe in obsessing over our users, not our competitors. We are a perpetual work in progress.<p>We’re looking for:<p>- Full Stack Engineers (we mostly use Ruby and other elements of a Rails-like stack)<p>- Mobile &#x2F; iOS Engineers (the mobile product we build is at the core of our business)<p>- Product Designers (the intersection of technology with media and design makes this an especially fun place for creators)<p>- Product Analysts (data is at the heart of everything we do)<p>If you’re interested, check out our jobs page: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twenty20.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twenty20.com&#x2F;jobs</a>.","time":1449000427,"type":"comment"}
