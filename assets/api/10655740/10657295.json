We believe communities get closer when people get off the couch and have fun at a live event. Backed by Accel Partners as well as team owners Jeff Mallett (Giants &#x2F; Whitecaps &#x2F; Derby FC), Vivek Ranadive (Kings), and David Blitzer (76ers &#x2F; Devils) we&#x27;ve raised $13mm (including $8mm in May of 2015).<p>Built for iOS and Android, Gametime makes getting into the game as amazing as being there. Inside gametime.co&#x2F;app we provide high-res panoramic photos from every section, curated listings as we decrease a universe of 5000 options to the 50 best with ultra fast two-tap checkout and no printing. With our mobile-only approach, we&#x27;ve reduced a 30-minute process to 30 seconds. This approach has led to fast (600% annual) and viral (92% of new purchasers hear about the app from friends) growth.<p>New Gametimers join for the community of high-performers (known as the Gameteam). New employees also love the environment as we aspire to build the best place to work in SF...<p>We offer market rate salary (even though we’re small) and real equity (meaning you come out way ahead). Everyone here does meaningful work. You won&#x27;t end up on the &quot;login button team&quot; here, you will be a big part of the most important conversations on the engineering team. There’s free catered lunch Monday through Friday! Who said there was no such thing? We offer Blue Cross &#x2F; Blue Shield via Zenefits and dental insurance. We also have monthly $75 cell phone reimbursement and $80 commuter benefit. We love going to games and we&#x27;re right by AT&amp;T Park so (if you&#x27;re into it) you&#x27;ll hit a bunch of them with us. Go Giants!<p>In summary, we&#x27;re fast, well-funded and growing quickly. It&#x27;s an exciting time to join the Gameteam.","time":1448991902,"type":"comment"}
