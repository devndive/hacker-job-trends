Some pluses would include C++ and Java experience. Must be a friendly person who enjoys working with other people as we are a very team-centric environment.<p>A Developer Evanglist - this person should have experience building interesting applications using popular technologies such as Ruby on Rails, Django, etc. and be able to show us a few cool projects they've worked on. They should also be able to interact well with new people (they will be attending conferences on our behalf, visiting offices of other startups, etc.) and be well spoken, both in small groups and on stage giving presentations. Must also be willing and able to interact heavily with the developer community on popular social networking sites. The ability to write some thoughtful blog posts would be great as well.

The problem is that over time when dealing with a large number of users and lots of Excel files, Excel becomes unmanageable, inefficient and eventually 'Excel Hell' takes over.<p>What invariably ends up happening is a big old-guard player comes in and convinces the company to get rid of Excel, getting them to use an Excel 'look and feel'. The problem is that it's not Excel - rather it's a crappy web grid that gives the company 10% of what Excel can do. This story has played out over and over again – the customer buys the solution, ends up hating it and eventually moves back to using Excel.<p>At Vena we're coming at it from an entirely different angle: stay in Excel!

Almost every innovation in medicine and technology in the world has its roots in a science paper. If we want to speed up the world, we need to speed up science.<p>There are many inefficiencies in science:<p>* it's too slow (there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal and it being published)<p>* all the world's research ends up behind extraordinarily expensive paywalls, even though it was authored and peer-reviewed for free by the scientific community<p>* it hasn't moved out of PDF-land yet (scientists haven't been provided with the incentives to share things like data-sets, code, videos, and other kinds of rich media).<p>We are working on fixing this. We dream of a world where research is shared instantly, as soon as it's finished; where scientists share their full scientific output (data-sets, code, videos, and comments on all this media), and not just papers; and where a villager in India has as much access to the world's scientific output as a professor at Harvard.<p>We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accomplish this mission.

Full time. Remote is fine too.<p>Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.<p>We believe that science is dysfunctional, and we are working on fixing it. Almost every innovation in medicine and technology in the world has its roots in a science paper. If we want to speed up the world, we need to speed up science. There are many inefficiencies in science:<p>* it's too slow (there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal and it being published)<p>* all the world's research ends up behind extraordinarily expensive paywalls, even though it was authored and peer-reviewed for free by the scientific community<p>* it hasn't moved out of PDF-land yet (scientists haven't been provided with the incentives to share things like data-sets, code, videos, and other kinds of rich media).<p>We are working on fixing this. We dream of a world where research is shared instantly, as soon as it's finished; where scientists share their full scientific output (data-sets, code, videos, and comments on all this media), and not just papers; and where a villager in India has as much access to the world's scientific output as a professor at Harvard.<p>We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accomplish this mission.
