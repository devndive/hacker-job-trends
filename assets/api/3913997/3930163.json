We’re looking for an experienced Ruby on Rails developer to spearhead this newest iteration of our site, which will include rewriting some of our current functionality as well. (We’re currently built on Symfony 1.4.)<p>What we’re trying to build isn’t simple, but we’re confident that with the experience of having built most of it before, and with a venerable and well-rounded developer to take the reins on the project, we’ll be able to do it well, do it quickly, and make a real impact on the space.<p>About us: we’re young, inexperienced, and extremely committed to this company. Currently we’re just one CTO/developer and one CEO/bizdev guy, with a few other folks helping out peripherally. Ideally, you’d be as passionate about the product as we are, and would want to join us in a full-time role. For the right person, we can offer a competitive salary, equity, and a chance to make this project as much of yours as it is ours.<p>Get in touch: abecker AT govhub DOT org.<p><a href=\"http://blog.govhub.org/post/22396376388/govhub-is-looking-for-a-full-stack-rails-developer-to\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.govhub.org/post/22396376388/govhub-is-looking-fo...</a>","time":1336162729,"type":"comment"}
