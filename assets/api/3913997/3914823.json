(<a href=\"http://zombiesrungame.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://zombiesrungame.com</a>), a running game and audio adventure for iOS. ZR was #1 Top Grossing Health and Fitness across the world for two weeks and continues to stay in the top 5; we have an Android version coming out soon and are working on extending and expanding the game.<p>We're a small team of five people, but we're growing rapidly off the success of ZR since we're already profitable and not reliant on any investors. At the moment we want to continue developing ZR across mobile platforms, as well as begin development on new and highly innovative mobile games.<p>You'll have the opportunity to make a big difference on the games that we make - games that aren't like anything that people have seen before. At $7.99, ZR is the most expensive game in the Top 200 Paid, and the third most expensive app after Apple's. In other words, we make games so attractive that people are prepared to pay eight times the going rate. That's our business model.<p>We're not interested in gamification or making casual games - we treat smartphones not as faster Gameboys, but as the very first wearable computers. Are you?<p>This position is for London, UK. Email hello (at) sixtostart.com","time":1335886415,"type":"comment"}
