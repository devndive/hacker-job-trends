Does the idea of hacking on an old-school graphics demo that fits into a DOS MBR in your free time appeal to you? Does \"Dazed and confused, but trying to continue\" mean anything to you? Have you ever told a joke whose punch line was a git command? If you've answered yes to any of the above, I think we'll be fast friends -- and we want to hear from you.<p>We're looking for engineers who are excited to work on technology that most people will tell you is impossible: updating an OS kernel while it is running. Help us bring rebootless kernel updates to Linux, as well as new operating system kernels and other parts of the software stack. You must have prior experience with operating systems, including kernel programming, debugging, porting, memory management, and/or virtualization. Experience with compilers is also relevant.<p>About us:\nWe're a small, tight-knit team of twelve men and women that enjoy working on hard technology problems. We were recently acquired by Oracle, and are eager to take advantage of its vast resources to get Ksplice into the hands of sysadmins everywhere.<p>Feel free to direct questions to me at waseem.daher@oracle.com or to jobs@ksplice.com. If you're interested, send us a resume and we'll be in touch. Oracle is an equal opportunity employer.","time":1335903875,"type":"comment"}
