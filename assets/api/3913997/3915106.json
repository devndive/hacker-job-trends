We're now a top 100 site and one of the top 3 rails sites on the web by traffic.  But we still have a very small, tight-knit team where each person plays a critical role.<p>Scribd alumni have gone on to found four other YCombinator companies, more than from any other startup.  We think this says something about the kind of people that we like to hire.<p>Technology-wise, we mostly work with Rails, Javascript, and iOS.  We also have a lot of challenges related to machine learning, text mining, and scaling large web infrastructure.  We're looking for generalists with an interest in one or more of those areas.  See <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.scribd.com/jobs</a> for lots more detail on the stuff we've built, a lot of which we've open sourced.<p>We're in downtown SF but we've hired a team of the best people we could find from around the world.  Relocation and H1B / J1 visas are no problem.<p>We've gotten some tremendously talented people from these \"Who's hiring posts\" before.  If you're interested, please get in touch with me directly - jared  at scribd.com.","time":1335889573,"type":"comment"}
