We provide a simple, easy way for teachers to create digital portfolios of student work using their smartphone.<p>Our current backend is Rails/Postgres on Heroku and our frontend is built using HAML/SASS/JS. We use HTML5 + JS + Phonegap (Cordova) for our iOS and Android apps.<p>We're looking for:<p>Rails Developers - you're a knowledgable, fast learner excited to build a meaningful product. We push code daily and develop priorities based on teacher feedback. There's still a lot to do, and you'll have the opportunity to build out and take charge of significant features.<p>Front-end Developers - you're familiar working in a Rails environment and love getting things perfect. You want to build out a product for teachers that's not just well made, but a joy to use. You like standards and graceful degradation for our friends with IE (but not 6!)<p>Javascript Developers - we're starting on a robust, backbone.js based frontend for the website and have built our app out almost entirely in Javascript. Love making quality web apps? Shoot us an email.<p>Interested in education?
