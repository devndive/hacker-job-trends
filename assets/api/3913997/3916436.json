We're a small company with a laid-back atmosphere (we love dogs and barbecue) located right on Union Square, in the heart of the city.<p>We are looking for both back-end and front-end engineers to help grow our product. We value folks who are passionate about and take pride in their craft, more than buzzword compliance. Our stack includes css, html5, javascript (with a homegrown MVC framework) on the front-end, and PHP, some C, PostgreSQL, Sphinx and Memcached on the back-end. While specific experience with any of those is a plus, we want engineers who write quality code and design clean solutions.<p>Our diverse staff includes veteran engineers from HotJobs and Yahoo, one of Computerworld's 40 Under 40 tech innovators, and even a well-known concert photographer. We offer competitive salaries, stock options, bonuses, great benefits, and try to grab dinner together (on the company!) every few weeks.\nIf you're interested, shoot an e-mail to devjobs@photoshelter.com.
