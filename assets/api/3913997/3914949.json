Some of the projects we’re working on right now include: tools for Kickstarter’s project creators, payment processing for millions of dollars in pledges every week, and new ways to discover projects through social recommendations and data analysis.<p>We deploy daily for features big and small, and encourage contribution to open source projects. Everyone in product and design commits code, so expect to work closely with people up and down the stack (right now we're 7 engineers with another 5 or 6 committers). We develop in Rails and JavaScript/jQuery, host on AWS, and manage code in git — but we’re not dogmatic about it.<p>You can checkout some of the projects we've open sourced on our github organization page here: <a href=\"https://github.com/kickstarter\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/kickstarter</a><p>So if you’re interested in helping us build a platform that is changing how culture gets made, get in touch -- jobs [at] kickstarter.com. We’d love to see your favorite work, whether it’s a side project or your github profile.","time":1335887783,"type":"comment"}
