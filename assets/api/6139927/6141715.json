We help companies get more sales and customers so they can hire more folks and ship better products.  We do this through what&#x27;s know as ad retargeting and real-time bidding.  When people leave your site without coming back to complete a transaction, we bring them back by serving ads to them on Facebook and the web. If you spend $10 with us, we can make you $100.  It&#x27;s pretty amazing.<p>We have thousands of customers including many companies you know and love.  We&#x27;re generating significant revenue and growing our team swiftly with folks from Google, Stanford, Accenture Tech Labs, and Tubemogul.<p>We&#x27;re up against companies 10x our size, and winning regularly because our product is awesome and our customers understand how much we love working on it.<p>Underneath our simple self-service dashboard is a massive beast of a real-time bidding platform that processes billions and billions of ad requests a day.  We&#x27;re looking for an engineer to tame this beast using common sense and lots and lots of automation.  If you like using tools like Scout, Nagios, and Jenkins and want to do something really, really hard, this might be a good fit for you!<p>We&#x27;re backed by A-list investors.  We have A-list customers.  We work out of two gorgeous luxury live-work apartments in SoMa, and an office in the heart of Chicago.  We ship code every day and let our team choose the tools they want to use.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in helping us tame the beast, we&#x27;d love to talk to you.
