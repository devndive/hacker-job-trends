We&#x27;ve named our high-tech company after this dish, and strive to be simple, useful and friendly. Our work spans music, teaching and building gadgets. We&#x27;re based in a small town called Allahabad in northern India. We&#x27;re looking for people who are or have been musicians, have taught at some level and are programmers or chip designers.
