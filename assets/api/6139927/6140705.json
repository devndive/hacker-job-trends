And we already have the backing to do so. Look out for our TV campaigns coming soon.<p>As you may surmise, we&#x27;re no ordinary startup. Having a corporate backer, whose values and principles are reflected in this spinout, we get to retain the benefit of stability from CustomInk while enjoying the speed of a startup.<p>Where are we now?<p>We&#x27;ve already implemented a mobile-first, responsive design (cart included). CoffeeScript. Jenkins. New Relic. Agile, light Kanban. It&#x27;s time to grow our platform.<p>We&#x27;re data driven, funnels are monitored though GA&#x2F;Kissmetrics and we have seen significant, measurable improvements based on our process.<p>I&#x27;ve been told many a time that we are a &quot;sane startup&quot;. Not something that most startups can claim.<p>Interested in hearing more?
