The abilities to self manage and work directly with scientists are a must.<p>Things we use:\n* Linux\n* Go (golang), python (numpy, scipy), javascript (d3.js, node.js in dev), R, C, C++\n* HTML5, websockets, REST, json\n* mongo, neo4j, solr&#x2F;lucene, sql\n* random forests, boolean networks, information theory, statistics and [spectral] graph theory<p>Things we don&#x27;t use:\n* Hadoop<p>We are a largely grant funded non profit with a mandate to open source code. You may have seen our analysis  running on 600,000 cores streaming results to a webapp during the compute engine demo at last years Google IO.<p>See &quot;Shumelevich Lab&quot; postings here:\n<a href=\"http://www.systemsbiology.org/open-positions\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.systemsbiology.org&#x2F;open-positions</a>","time":1375371969,"type":"comment"}
