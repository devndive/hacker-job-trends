While we&#x27;re in stealth, we&#x27;re well-funded by a long list of tier-1 VCs and angels (Yuri Milner, a16z, Keith Rabois, Michael Kors, and many others including a number of celebrities).<p>We are small and are carefully growing our team - we have a strong preference for founders or people who have worked at startups. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about working here - the founders have created a great culture.<p>In San Francisco, we&#x27;re looking for:<p>* iOS &#x2F; Android developers (if you&#x27;re a mobile animal, we want to talk!)<p>* computer vision &#x2F; image recognition experts<p>* machine learning specialists<p>* UI&#x2F;UX designers<p>* software engineering interns (open to the type)<p>If you like to really own the product you&#x27;re working on, soup to nuts, and any of this excites\nyou, feel free to reach out to me directly: eugene at mecommerce.com","time":1375362275,"type":"comment"}
