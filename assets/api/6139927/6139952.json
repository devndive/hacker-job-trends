We&#x27;re an edtech startup with funding some of the biggest names in the valley (Jeff Clavier, Ron Conway, General Catalyst, Mitch Kapor...), and we&#x27;re one of the fastest growing education companies of all time.  \nWe&#x27;re the only non-YC company that Paul Graham has ever invested in. We&#x27;ve built a product that makes a real difference and gets huge engagement with millions of kids, and we&#x27;re about to take it to the next level, hopefully with you on board.

We have native clients for iOS, Android and even Windows Desktop, and a rich JavaScript web client, and all of these consume the same API.<p>You&#x27;ll work on architecting the API and implementing an internal node.js framework which bakes in resource sharing and permissions, provides realtime notifications and events to our clients, and which offloads CPU intensive tasks to asynchronous offline processes.<p>Throughout you&#x27;ll be designing a beautiful API that is used by developers every day, you&#x27;ll be solving difficult architecture and distributed systems problems, and you&#x27;ll be a part of an important company shaping educational outcomes for millions of kids in America and worldwide.<p>--------------------<p>What skills are we looking for?<p>--------------------<p>* Relevant experience in designing or maintaining a mature API is important to us. This could be through work at a prior company or through your personal projects or open-source work. We&#x27;d really like to see an example of an API you&#x27;ve worked on. We know every API has warts, but that&#x27;s fine - we look forward to discussing the trade-offs you had to make.<p>* Experience working on a production system or some type of live product is important.<p>* An educational background in Computer Science or Math is preferred but not essential.<p>Is this you?
