We&#x27;ve just completed an initial round of funding, and now we need a developer to help us build out Procure.io and Screendoor.io -- our software that makes it easy for government to buy things. Are you the right fit?<p>You will work with us to build out the Screendoor.io platform. This means you need serious Ruby chops, some knowledge of systems administration, a self-driven work ethic, and a healthy sense of humor. You&#x27;re going to be part of the founding DNA of this company, so fit and ethic mean a lot to us -- procurement and government isn&#x27;t for everyone. But for the kind of person who wants to make government work better, and wants to build a great business doing it, we&#x27;re a fit.<p>The nutshell:<p>- Experienced in Ruby\n- Passion for good user experience\n- Comfortable working in remote environments<p>Interested?
