We&#x27;re Nylas and our team is building the next generation email platform, starting with beautiful APIs.\nDevelopers depend on our APIs, so we have to be reliable, up all the time, and fast. We have more data for a single user than in most startups&#x27; entire database. That means big technical challenges to solve as we scale our fledgling distributed backend. We&#x27;ve also been working on a new email client, and we&#x27;re looking for product designers and front-end engineers.<p>We&#x27;re using React, Flux, and Electron. More here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nylas.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;splitting-the-atom\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nylas.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;splitting-the-atom</a><p>== More about us ==<p>• Backend: Python, Flask, gevent, nginx, MySQL, AWS, and Debian.<p>• Frontend: Coffeescript, React, (Re)Flux, WebSQL, Atom Shell (NodeJS + Chromium)<p>• Like open source? Us too-- check it out: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nylas\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nylas</a><p>• We&#x27;re 40% women on our team of 13 (12 engineers), including 1 of 2 cofounders. We want to make that number 50%.<p>• Our sunny Mission office is more lived-in than tidy. Think art studio, not corporate. Our team is more likely to end up in Yosemite or on a bike ride together than drinking at the latest startup event.<p>• We have a flexible vacation policy and value personal responsibility and ownership. Benefits include full health, dental, vision, commuter, and lunch at the office every day. Some remote work &#x2F; work-from-home is OK too.<p>Apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nylas.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nylas.com&#x2F;jobs</a> and mention HN. We love it when candidates let us know what draws them to the job, and we encourage applications from women, LGBTQ folks, and people of diverse backgrounds.\nSome recent press: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;27&#x2F;next-gen-email-platform-nil...\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;27&#x2F;next-gen-email-platform-nil...</a>.","time":1433174423,"type":"comment"}
