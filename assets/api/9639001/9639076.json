Journalists have used DocumentCloud in world-changing reporting from the first publicly posted Snowden documents to the Ferguson Grand Jury documents.<p>We&#x27;re opening our platform to the public because document analysis isn&#x27;t just a journalist&#x27;s problem.<p>So, your focus with our tech lead (that&#x27;s me) will be on our document processing capabilities as we implement new ways to extract data from documents, and tighten down the efficiency &amp; scalability of our current tools.<p>DocumentCloud is a polyglot Rails&#x2F;Backbone stack, with some processing components written in Java &amp; C++.  We do what it takes to turn documents into data, and you&#x27;re guaranteed to learn a lot on the job!<p>We write FOSS code that&#x27;s directly connected to the public good. (We&#x27;re where Backbone.js &amp; Underscore.js came from &amp; you can check out our other projects here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;documentcloud\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;documentcloud</a>)<p>Drop us a line at jobs@documentcloud.org<p>(This is a full-time remote job with excellent benefits &amp; sane expectations of work-life balance.)","time":1433171027,"type":"comment"}
