We&#x27;d also be interested in a remote team member (preferably based in the Midwest or East Coast US) depending on expertise.<p>---<p>Hello, we’re Spantree, a rapidly growing boutique software engineering consultancy headquartered in West Loop of Chicago. We’re looking for a brilliant and personable engineer to join our team. Our clients range from small and scrappy startups to large banks and insurance companies. While we have a pretty broad technical focus, a key element to most of the stuff we do is building tools to help people make better decisions.<p>Our technical role on projects varies a bit depending on the customer, so we’re hiring organically for generalists that can be flexible up and down the stack. Though if you have deep expertise in some of the technologies listed above (esp Elasticsearch or Docker&#x2F;Mesos), we can teach you the rest on an as-needed basis.<p>We offer competitive compensation, relatively flexible work schedules, health&#x2F;vision&#x2F;dental, 401K matching and the usual tech company perks (a copious amount of catered lunches in our Chicago offices, etc).<p>To find out more about who we are, please feel free to visit our website at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spantree.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spantree.net</a> and reach out via jobs@spantree.net.","time":1433176165,"type":"comment"}
