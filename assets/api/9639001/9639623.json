Recently funded; customers include Facebook, Box.com, Pfizer, Nestle, Gap and more.<p>We are seeking a big data guru -- someone who can help us grow from handling merely biggish data to truly massive data collection and processing. Presently our infrastructure is built around MongoDB, but we are well aware of its limitations and anticipate moving to something such as Postgres and&#x2F;or Cassandra&#x2F;Hadoop.\nOur ideal candidate has 4+ years of experience in the real world dealing with terabytes of data, distributed file systems, map&#x2F;reduce style processing, and building systems that remain robust to component failure and network issues.
