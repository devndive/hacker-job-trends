Lots of java running on AWS deployed via puppet, but python, node, groovy, Angular and R are all used as appropriate.<p>However, the primary need is for someone who can help build back end systems in java using tools like Kafka and Hive, or who can play a devops role a largish AWS environment.  We operate in small teams (3-8 engineers) with a fair bit of autonomy--use Rally and agile processes.  Quarterly hackweeks. Forward looking engineering culture--continuous deployment, testing.","time":1433183181,"type":"comment"}
