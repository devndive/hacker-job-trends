We have trained machines to understand sports at a level of sophistication that exceeds that of most collegiate players. Using this machine understanding, we deliver analytics software that is helping ten NBA teams win more games, is enabling national broadcasters to tell better stories, and will give every fan their own personal sportscast. We have recently signed deals with ESPN and Fox to deliver content for their broadcasts, starting with this clip that appeared on NBA Countdown: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;espn.go.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;clip?id=12510250\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;espn.go.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;clip?id=12510250</a>, and extending to interactive products that the broadcasters will use on air.<p>We are looking for a variety of engineering roles, including full-stack, UI&#x2F;UX, systems, mobile, dev-ops, machine learning and computer vision engineers. The responsibilities range from sophisticated UI design that supports detailed but intuitive analytics, to front-end interfaces that will appear on national sports broadcasts, to scalable backend infrastructure that supports robust video streaming, to ML and CV engineering that enables the semantic layer that understands the game. Our software stack is based around Node, Go and Python, and we also use C++ for our video systems.<p>In addition to the engineering roles, weâ€™re also hiring a product manager who will guide our engineering and design efforts in order to deliver our technology to all our customers, ranging from NBA coaches to casual fans of the game.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in joining us, our jobs email is is work@secondspectrum.com. I&#x27;m also available for any questions you might have at noel@secondspectrum.com","time":1433174604,"type":"comment"}
