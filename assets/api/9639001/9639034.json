The goal is to be the best way to learn any piece of music.<p>See <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.soundslice.com&#x2F;demo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.soundslice.com&#x2F;demo</a> for an example. It&#x27;s one of the coolest HTML5 web apps in the world that&#x27;s an actual business and not a project. When I originally posted it to HN, it stayed at the top of the homepage for the better part of a day and was universally praised: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=4790636\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=4790636</a><p>Soundslice is a small (two-person) business -- you&#x27;d be the third. It&#x27;s proudly bootstrapped and makes money. We make money by (1) licensing our technology, (2) selling a subscription service to music teachers and (3) selling interactive sheet music.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a UX designer. Somebody who&#x27;s good at the whole design process -- understanding problems, creating mockups, implementing in HTML&#x2F;CSS.<p>WHY WORK HERE:<p>* You&#x27;d work on an amazing product that helps people learn music.<p>* Design is front-and-center of our product. Much of its value is pure UX.<p>* Excellent work&#x2F;life balance.<p>* You&#x27;d work with me (one of the people who created Django, plus some other stuff; see holovaty.com). I&#x27;m an experienced developer and can teach you a lot, if you&#x27;re open to it.<p>Email me (Adrian Holovaty) at adrian@soundslice.com.","time":1433170762,"type":"comment"}
