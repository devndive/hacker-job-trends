You do not need any Javascript experience to apply (we&#x27;ve hired many people without it) we find it easier to teach good engineers Javascript then to teach Javascript developers good software engineering skills.<p>We&#x27;re hiring developers for our Spark Enhance product: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sorensonmedia.com&#x2F;spark&#x2F;enhance&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sorensonmedia.com&#x2F;spark&#x2F;enhance&#x2F;</a><p>We work in an Agile environment with daily Scrums, Retrospectives and 2 week sprints (though some teams have been experimenting with Kanban) and a real focus on the Engineering department owning the Engineering processes which means you get to spend your time writing code and have the autonomy to try changes to the processes and see if they work.<p>We&#x27;re looking for multiple engineers with a range of experience levels (from recent grads to Senior Developers) so I can&#x27;t specify specific salaries but I think they tend to be higher than most other Cardiff companies.<p>If any of this sounds interesting then feel free to contact me at mgrover@sorensonmedia.com with any questions, CVs, github profiles etc.<p>Thanks - Matt","time":1433170793,"type":"comment"}
