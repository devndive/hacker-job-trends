Our first offering is a pre-paid debit card that blocks undesirable transactions in real-time.<p>At its core, it’s a Java server connected to the major card networks with multiple instances spread geographically.  It responds in 10-20ms, and has to stay that tight for us to grow. Understanding distributed systems (construction, diagnosis, and management) is key.<p>We also have a large Rails stack for our customers and our own rapidly evolving business. Join us, and you can touch it all: front-end, back-end, asynchronous queue-driven workers, real-time rules processing, complex calculation engines, mobile, etc.<p>All of this great technology helps make someone have a better day. We offer a mixture of salary and equity, and the chance to work with an amazing team of people across a range of disciplines.  If all of that sounds good to you, let’s talk.<p>Because of the stage of the company we unfortunately cannot consider candidates with minimal experience (e.g. recent dev bootcamp graduates). We need people that have professional experience working as an engineer. We are also only looking to make an in-house, full-time hire here in San Francisco and cannot support part-time, remote, or contract work at this time.<p>To apply for a job, email jobs@truelinkfinancial.com.","time":1433176805,"type":"comment"}
