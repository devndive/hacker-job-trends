We are looking beyond traditional metrics like credit scores and using data science and software to reinvent lending.<p>Our technology team is made up of data scientists, software engineers and data engineers that decide how they work best. We believe this allows for people to take greater ownership and approach problems creatively. We find value in code reviews, pair programming and paying down technical debt. Every day we are deploying code and launching features with few internal bureaucratic barriers to get closer to our vision of a better, more just bank. We’re constantly reflecting on how we can improve our product and processes, and will quickly push towards better solutions as they come. We value diversity of perspective, and evaluate ideas on merits, not seniority.","time":1433173403,"type":"comment"}
