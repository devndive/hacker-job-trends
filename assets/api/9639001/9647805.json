You’ll work closely with your own team of 2-4 developers (to be hired by you), as well as MoveOn.org Civic Action and MoveOn.org Political Action’s terrific, small (25-30 people), and tight-knit staff.<p>In full transparency, my wife works at MoveOn and I am advising them on this role and some of their future tech plans. I have always been impressed by how they work. The entire team is remote and the wage should be competitive for a manager level position - doing both some coding and some people management.
