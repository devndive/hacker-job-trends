Now it&#x27;s grown to more than 20 full time employees, a website, a newsletter, a huge social media reach (#EEEEEATS), mobile apps, and a text message recommendation service.<p>This was all done with basically ZERO product investment. The good news is they&#x27;ve realized this and raised a series A to transition from an editorial&#x2F;blog into a utility platform ala an expert curated Yelp&#x2F;Foursquare. I came on this summer to build out a great engineering team. They&#x27;ve done in what my opinion is the hard work of building a brand with an audience in the millions, now it&#x27;s our job to 10x that with great products.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone with 4+ years web development experience to contribute to and take ownership of the platform that runs <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theinfatuation.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theinfatuation.com</a>. This platform is the life blood of our products and powers all digital incarnations of The Infatuation. It&#x27;s a Django app and we will be carving out pieces into individual Python&#x2F;Go services (search, registration, recommendations, etc.).<p>If this induces some heavy breathing reach out to me at buck@theinfatuation.com.<p>Adios!<p>-Buck","time":1483375571,"type":"comment"}
