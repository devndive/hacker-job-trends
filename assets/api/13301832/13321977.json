Skyven aims to change that by making distributed CST competitive with natural gas, without subsidy, within five years.<p>We are looking for a lead embedded electronics engineer to make a direct and enormous impact on technology development for Skyven Technologies&#x27; flagship product, the Solar Concentrating System (SCS).  The role will entail algorithm development, embedded firmware programming, circuit design, PCB design, component selection, verification, contract manufacturing, testing, debug, and bring-up. Note: if you&#x27;re a whiz at algorithms and firmware but you don&#x27;t do a lot of hardware design, you might still be a fit.  We&#x27;ve got some incredibly interesting control systems and mesh networking challenges for you!<p>Degree &#x2F; Experience Requirements: \n+ B.S. with 5+ years of work experience, or a graduate degree with 3+ years of experience, including algorithms, embedded programming, and hardware design.\n+ If you don&#x27;t meet these requirements, but you LIVE and BREATH embedded electronics and robotics, please write us a note to tell use about the most awesome thing you&#x27;ve done with embedded.<p>Apply by emailing a resume to info@skyven.co.
