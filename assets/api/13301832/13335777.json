We are driving a new manufacturing paradigm based on the Internet of Things, advanced big-data analytics, adaptive user-assistance systems and intelligent machines and robots. We are working hand-in-hand with manufactures to develop the operating system of the factory of the future. We solve hard technical problems, constantly working toward our vision of smart, adaptive, sustainable and efficient manufacturing.<p>The fourth industrial revolution is transforming how people interact with their work environment, from machine operators to plant managers and across a highly diverse workforce. We strongly believe that there is huge positive potential in tackling this challenge and we feel the social responsibility to get it right. We also know that in order to achieve a sustainable solution we need to blend our extraordinarily strong engineering with exceptionally good user experience and frontend design—we are aiming at nothing less than a redefinition of the term “industrial-grade software”.<p>We are looking for experienced frontend engineers who enjoy the challenge posed by creating user interfaces for ruggedized devices on the factory shop-floor, with state of the art interaction speed and robust offline capabilities.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.actyx.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;join-us&#x2F;frontend-engineer&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.actyx.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;join-us&#x2F;frontend-engineer&#x2F;</a><p>Applicants must live in central Europe and have valid working visa for the EU if applicable.","time":1483705723,"type":"comment"}
