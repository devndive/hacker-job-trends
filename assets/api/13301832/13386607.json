That has resulted in the worldâ€™s largest dataset of aligned RGB-D images--200 million images from 300,000 different locations, and we want you to help us work with it. We have a broad research agenda focusing on 3D reconstruction and deep learning that includes semantic labeling and segmentation, 3D object classification and pose estimation, depth from RGB, estimation of unseen 3D surfaces, texture&#x2F;depth in-filling, photogrammetry, SLAM, keypoint matching, and passive stereo.<p>Check out the gallery here: matterport.com&#x2F;gallery<p>matterport.com<p>Roles: Computer Vision Engineer &#x2F; Computer Vis.
