This is a great opportunity to work with very smart people in very challenging problems (I actually mean this, I am a software engineer who just started last November and I am astonished at the projects I have been able to work on so far and the technologies I have used). We are a new team and we are trying to find great software engineers to grow our team. We need them as the scale of the problems we are trying to solve is huge and we put a lot of focus on creating elegant solutions for those problems. One big plus also is that we encourage continuous learning (we have workshops and tech talks often) and we love it when you contribute (or have contributed) to an open source project. We want to give back to the community in different ways too (we volunteer, and do meetups frequently). So if you are super smart, like to be surrounded by smart people and solve difficult distributed problems, and you want to help define and build our office culture, you should contact us! Just a note, we expect you to have a good working knowledge of at least one JVM language (preferably Java or Scala). Get in touch at wmtech.reston@gmail.com","time":1483389276,"type":"comment"}
