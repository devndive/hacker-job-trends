Our ideal candidate has experience building data intensive systems, web crawling, search and indexing, distributed systems, etc.<p>We don&#x27;t have a strong preference on programming languages or technologies, but here are some that we currently use: Node.js, Golang, Kubernetes, AWS, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, ElasticSearch.<p>We started Blockai with the simple belief that people who create things should own their creations. As the world continues to change and many jobs get automated, one of the few things that won&#x27;t be replaced is creativity. Thus, it is an imperative that there be proper infrastructure for creators to manage, monitor and monetize their work. We believe what we are building will enrich the lives of creators and inspire more people to create, making the world a better place.<p>If you&#x27;re up for the challenge, send me an email (oli@blockai.com) and mention HN.","time":1483375329,"type":"comment"}
