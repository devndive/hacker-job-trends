We build a WebRTC-powered platform and SDKs, and have great clients from individual developers to massive players in tech, entertainment, education, and many other industries (customers include the Minerva Project, Chegg, esurance, Major League Baseball, Double Robotics, and Fox Sports). We&#x27;ve been doing real-time communications for over 8 years - first with Flash, and now WebRTC. We were acquired by Telefonica 4 or so years ago. It hasn&#x27;t changed the culture much, and has helped us reach more customers around the world.<p>The product is industry leading, but the atmosphere and people make this place where I work. It&#x27;s an awesome group of 100 or so people- nice, smart, skilled. We are laid back and have a sense of humor. Minimal politics. Good salary and benefits, and a relaxed, enjoyable environment!<p>We&#x27;re hiring many engineers, business development people, and marketing people, as well as someone for the accounting team.
