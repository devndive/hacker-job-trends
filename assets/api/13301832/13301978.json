We recently launched a product (Donation Spring - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.donationspring.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.donationspring.com</a>) and plan to aggressively promote it after the new year.   Additionally, we continue to pitch our overall consulting and development services.<p>What I&#x27;m looking for:<p>- Someone with sales&#x2F;marketing chops. A sales or account exec career history is helpful, but not a requirement -- we&#x27;ll consider anyone with relevant backgrounds and personality&#x2F;passion alignment.<p>- Experience&#x2F;familiarity with the nonprofit and church industry.<p>- Major bonus points to bringing an existing network of nonprofit&#x2F;church prospects.<p>- Located anywhere in the US.  The more geographically diverse our team can be, the better.<p>- Freelance contract, part-time, at your own pace.  Pay is a traditional commission based on account revenue (negotiable).<p>- Fun, easy going, and service-centered heart.  Our primary focus is <i>serving</i> both nonprofit&#x2F;church missions as well as helping their staff in any tech-centric way we can.<p>If that describes you, I&#x27;d love to chat!<p>Brett Meyer\nbrett@3riverdev.com","time":1483374009,"type":"comment"}
