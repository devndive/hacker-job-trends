Join a team working to make live events and ticketing wonderful for fans and venues - all the while. Stack is heavily Scala and Ember, all on AWS.<p>We work in small, tightly-knit agile squads (5-7 team members) including a dedicated product owner and design resource. Our offices are in SOMA, there&#x27;s well-stocked kitchens and weekly lunches.<p>It&#x27;s a great place to work - you even get a budget for attending live events each year, any you choose! I&#x27;m a product manager here and I love it. You can even (if you want) go on-site to work at music festivals and venues to learn more about how what you build is impacting our customers.<p>Email brad+hn&#x2F;at&#x2F;ticketfly.com if you&#x27;ve got any questions about the positions posted.","time":1483385676,"type":"comment"}
