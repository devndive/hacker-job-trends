This allows low-income customers to get cheaper plans and free data. Our software runs on low-end Android phones, requiring native code and a focus on high performance. We work on all sections of the stack, from low-level native code, scaling servers, front-end web development, custom network protocols, and all sorts of interesting problems. This is not a CRUD app or working inside someone else&#x27;s framework and tools. We create the tools and frameworks :)<p>I&#x27;m interested in people who want to work with Java &#x2F; Python &#x2F; C &#x2F; JavaScript &#x2F; Android NDK and aren&#x27;t afraid to solve problems where google doesn&#x27;t help very much.<p>Email james@airfox.io","time":1483380359,"type":"comment"}
