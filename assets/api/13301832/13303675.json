We&#x27;re looking for solid engineers with experience building web applications. We have a job listing you can see below. Our preferred stack is Rails &amp; Postgres, and some of us work in the Microsoft stack too (C#, ASP.NET MVC). The work is all remote, but we have a strong preference for people in the mid-Atlantic region.<p>We&#x27;re not trying to grow to 500 people and sell. We&#x27;re focused on building a highly competent and easy-to-work-with team; building honest, lasting relationships with our clients; and building a company we&#x27;re all happy to work for. If that sounds appealing, we&#x27;d love to talk to you.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;131835&#x2F;web-application-engineer-ecstatic-labs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;131835&#x2F;web-application-enginee...</a>","time":1483385251,"type":"comment"}
