Thanks for the nearly 10,000 hits yesterday [1]; that was a blast for us. Each dollar of the $10,000 prize in our app challenge this weekend [2] is now dedicated to one of you.<p>Singly is hiring a lead developer evangelist and horde of generalist engineers to build a cross-service API that provides merged, normalized and deduplicated data from all of your personal sources (Facebook, Foursquare, Fitbit, email, text messages, you name it). We recently closed $7MM in funding, which we're using to expand the team and ramp up developer outreach, as well as put on huge events like this weekend. Mega bonus points you've got tons of experience building or heavily consuming APIs, but if you're smart and like burritos, let's chat.<p>Apply through <a href=\"https://singly.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://singly.com/jobs</a> or kristjan@singly.com. Or, just come hang with us in #singly on irc.freenode.net and at our monthly happy hours [3].<p>Happy hunting!<p>[1] <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4048324\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4048324</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https://singly.com/appchallenge\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://singly.com/appchallenge</a>\n[3] <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Singly-Happy-Hour/events/65360972/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.meetup.com/Singly-Happy-Hour/events/65360972/</a>","time":1338570414,"type":"comment"}
