Ruby on Rails + jQuery stack, 12-ish person engineering team, the usual startup perks (catering, snacks, soda, etc), gym membership reimbursement, etc. Ways we're trying to make ourselves better engineers:<p>- deliberate practice with our tools. If you are a vim user, we have the programmer who wrote Command-T on staff and he's a great person to learn from - every changeset gets pushed to Gerrit where it waits to get a +1 from our build suite (that runs in 3 minutes) and a +1 from a human reviewer<p>- over the last 4 months, we've upgraded from Rails 2.1 to 3.2.3 and are using the static asset pipeline, SASS/Compass, and HAML. We're the largest site I know of on Rails 3.2.<p>- everyone is encouraged to take one hour from their day to learn about something they wouldn't otherwise<p>- every story is scoped so that it can be completed in less than a day. We don't branch, we just work on top of master. We've found that the closer we stay to master, the less needless work we create for ourselves<p>Causes is a great place to better yourself and better the world. We're particularly looking for a systems/ops/network engineer to help wrangle our colo. Apply through the site or adam@causes.com if interested!","time":1338574981,"type":"comment"}
