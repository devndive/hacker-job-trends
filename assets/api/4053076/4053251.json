We're not in the software industry, but working here is far more fun than I ever had in that industry. BD has a smart, driven software team that is helping the company grow internationally at double-digits every year.<p>I'm looking for someone with strong SQL and development skills to join my team in a role that's part business analyst and part developer. This is not your typical corporate position - this is an opportunity to play a significant and highly visible role in the company.<p>You don't need to ski or climb to work here, but it's a plus!","time":1338557443,"type":"comment"}
