Think \"Wikipedia for hot-to instructions\". Over 30 million users a month. Here is why working at wikiHow is unlike anything else in Silicon Valley:<p>* We are profitable and offer a profit sharing plan.\n* We are self-funded. We have not accepted VC or angel money. We don't chart our strategy based on the whims of investors.\n* We don't think working crazy startup hours is productive or healthy. We have rich lives outside of work. \n* Our team is gender balanced. 50% female, 50% male. \n* We like walking. We have a few treadmill desks and we all have FitBits.\n* Our small, cohesive team loves to innovate. \n* We take wikiHow's educational mission seriously. We put our mission above short term business goals. \n* We all work from home one day a week. \n* We work in a homey downtown Palo Alto office, 2 blocks from Caltrain and University Avenue.\n* wikiHow is one of the top 200 sites on the web. Over 30 million readers a month. Your mom will use and love your product. \n* We're delightfully quirky. But you probably figured that out already.<p>Email me, the founder directly, Jack@wikiHow.com","time":1338586421,"type":"comment"}
