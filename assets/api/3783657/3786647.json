{"by":"dennisquintel","id":3786647,"parent":3783657,"text":"Amsterdam, Netherlands, Part/Full-time, remote work possible. ================================<p>The Energy Transition Model (ETM) is looking for an experienced developer in one or more: Ruby, Rails, Javascript (jQuery, backbone.js, CoffeeScript, etc). You follow the 20%/80% rule, prefer to re-use then to program and seemlessly switch from big picture to implementation details.\nWe answers questions like: \"If everybody switched to electric cars, how many solar plants have to be built?\". It is used by governments, companies, teachers to evaluate strategies dealing with events like peak oil, diminishing gas reserves and new technologies.<p>Quintel develops the ETM and is a charming Dutch (grown up) startup, with a central office in the center of Amsterdam. Our engineering-driven team (91% engineers, PhDs etc) get the work done during office hours, so that we can enjoy our evenings, sometimes together with afterwork-beers. The atmosphere goes from professional consultancy to monkey house in no time.<p>Our codebase has something for everyone. 30% plain Ruby, 30% Javascript, 30% Rails and 10% other code. We have good code, bad code, tested code, untested code. We have DSLs (for our non-programmers), API, fast ec2 instances for calculations. Things we did before: Git as a database, custom query language to extract data from the model, massive processing within a rails request (think thousands of ruby objects calculating energy flows). Visualizations with Raphael.<p>You are an experienced developer, you think lean and solve problems creatively. You're proactive, fix first, complain later. You live in (ordered by preference): Netherlands, Europe, World. You'll work the first months onsite, thereafter you may go abroad and work remote (again). Current dev team has an international background: Italian, British, Dutch, Swiss, US.<p>Reactions to: dennis@quintel.com","time":1333349607,"type":"comment"}
