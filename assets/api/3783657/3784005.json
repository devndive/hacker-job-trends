We give citizens the tools and information to interact with their elected officials in new, innovative ways.<p>We’re just two weeks past our public beta launch, but we’re rapidly expanding and know that we’ll need to expand the team if we want to challenge the notion that as a citizen in the United States, your influence ends at the ballot box. We have some great support from people both in the technology and political sectors, and the consensus is that this is the perfect time to be digitizing politics.<p>We’re currently a team of 2.5 developers and we’re looking for someone to join us full-time. We have a bunch of ideas and projects that we think you'll be excited to work on, but you will have just as much say as we do in determining our direction.<p>Our current stack is Symfony + Doctrine ORM + Saas + jQuery + PagodaBox (PHP PaaS). No need for familiarity with these, but experience with a MVC framework is necessary. We're also doing mobile development with Sencha Touch 2, so that might be a place where you'd need to lend a hand.<p>We can offer a competitive salary, equity, sandwiches, &#38; a chance to be part of a company that revolutionizes modern democracy.<p>Email me at abecker (at) mygovhub (dot) org.","time":1333296128,"type":"comment"}
