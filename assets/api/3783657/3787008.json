This includes using EC2/EBS/S3/RDS/IAM including the API, automation using Chef (or Puppet), managing and monitoring instances, etc.<p>* Some systems programming experience including a reasonable understanding of OSes, networking, and crypto / security. It would be a huge plus if you have substantial experience with C/C++ and systems programming on Linux.<p>* Above all, a fast learner.
