Ruby on Rails + jQuery stack, 10-ish person engineering team, the usual startup perks (catering, snacks, soda, etc), gym membership reimbursement, etc.\nWays we're trying to make ourselves better engineers:\n- deliberate practice with our tools. If you are a vim user, we have the programmer who wrote Command-T on staff and he's a great person to learn from\n- every changeset gets pushed to Gerrit where it waits to get a +1 from our build suite (that runs in 3 minutes) and a +1 from a human reviewer\n- actively upgrading our version of Rails, and not stopping until we hit bleeding edge. We hit Rails 2.3.14 last week and hope to hit 3.0.11 within the month\n- everyone is encouraged to take one hour from their day to learn about something they wouldn't otherwise\n- every story is scoped so that it can be completed in less than a day. We don't branch, we just work on top of master. We've found that the closer we stay to master, the less needless work we create for ourselves\nCauses is a great place to better yourself and better the world.
