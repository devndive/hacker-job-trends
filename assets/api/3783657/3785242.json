Our initial product is a hosted model to detect fraud online. Fraud is a huge, difficult problem because the bad guys are getting more and more sophisticated: just in the last month, they've hit our customers with money laundering schemes, used botnets to script mass creation of dummy accounts, set up fake Twilio numbers to fool SMS verification, and more. We're helping our customers fight back, and have huge plans beyond fraud.<p>We're a 5-person team of ex-Google and ex-Zillow engineers, and we're looking to hire engineers with expertise in machine learning, data mining, visualization, and large-scale distributed systems. Our stack includes Hadoop, Rails, d3.js, MongoDB, etc.<p>If that sounds exciting, send us a resume at jobs@siftscience.com.","time":1333319955,"type":"comment"}
