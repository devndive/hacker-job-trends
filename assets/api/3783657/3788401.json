Bungolow is a members-only site featuring curated hotel bookings for the wide-open Latin American market. Check us out at www.bungolow.com.<p>The reason for the interesting location tag up top is that we are currently participating in a TechStars Network accelerator in Buenos Aires. After the program, we aim to locate in a large U.S. city. This means: a) if you are a U.S. citizen, you have the opportunity to come hang out in an awesome South American city for 3 months then return with us to the U.S. of A; or b) if you are from outside the U.S., we will do everything in our power to get a visa for you to work in the U.S. In both instances, having you with us in BA is preferred but not required.<p>We're looking for a lead developer to drive the technological direction of the company. This is an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a high-potential start-up. The right candidate will be considered part of the founding team.<p>We're not as concerned about your education background or prior work experience (or for that matter, even the technologies you code in) as we are of seeing evidence of stuff you have shipped. Please send us some links to things you have created online, and make note of your involvement in each.<p>Send to careers at bungolow dot com.","time":1333378651,"type":"comment"}
