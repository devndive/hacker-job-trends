We&#x27;re profitable, with millions in monthly revenue, and we&#x27;re backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, and Max Levchin.<p>ENGINEERING POSITIONS<p>We have two types of engineering positions available - systems and product.<p>Systems engineers[1] build and scale our infrastructure, and write mostly C, C++, and Python. These are the people working on our custom datastore. This position requires at least 2 years of experience writing systems software. Solid C experience is a plus.<p>Product engineers[2] build the parts people interact with - reporting interfaces, APIs, dataviz stuff, and more - and write mostly Python, JS, and LESS. This position requires at least 2 years of software engineering experience, no specialization required. Solid JS experience is a plus though.<p>The engineering team is still small (8), and there&#x27;s a lot of interesting stuff to do. Happy to talk details.<p>If you are interested, drop me a line - tim@mixpanel.com.
