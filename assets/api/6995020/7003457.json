We&#x27;re a developer founded and run organization (both CEO and CTO are developers) with a stack that goes all the way from web crawlers to a big data processing architecture (Hive, EMR, S3) to middleware&#x2F;API to frontend (HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;Javascript.)<p>We&#x27;re an active member of the Santa Monica startup scene and are 5 blocks from the beach.  We don&#x27;t skimp on hardware or tools and are strong advocates of giant monitors and comfy chairs.  When we&#x27;re not at work, we play sports, surf, go to trivia nights, and generally try to make the most of the sun and beach.<p>We&#x27;re looking for an experienced fullstack developer that will work on projects up and down the stack.  Everything that we do affects our customers, and we&#x27;ve got some awesome features planned.  You&#x27;ll get to help drive the architecture and implementation of these.<p>We work using the latest .Net technologies, however, if you’re a strong developer without a .Net background, we’d love the opportunity to show you what we do and why we think it’s great.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in this full time position, please e-mail jobs at adomic.com.
