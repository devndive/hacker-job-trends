We have a team of about 40 working on the Nintendo Network Account Service which drives the NNID and other fun things.  We like putting smiles on people&#x27;s faces.  The team is working on a lot of cool stuff for the future and we need a Java stack wizard to mentor, lead, develop and snuggle with a bunch of rambunctious hackers.  I was just kidding about the snuggling.  If you&#x27;re interested, please e-mail me at shidoshi@gmail.com and tell me why.","time":1388616868,"type":"comment"}
