The bulk of R&amp;D will be done in the Helsinki office which at the moment only has a small team, so this is a great opportunity to get in early and grow with the company.<p>As a Java backend engineer youâ€™ll be part of the team responsible for code handling millions of events each day. You will also get the opportunity to work on a greenfield project and build the next generation of our backend infrastructure from the ground up. This work will involve analyzing the existing architecture, its load patterns and bottlenecks. Together with other team members, you will use this data to spec up and implement the new architecture.<p>We are also looking for a talented UX engineer to help us take our UI to the next level and change how our customers view their business critical data. Experience with Photoshop and wireframing&#x2F;prototyping tools such as Balsamiq Mockups is assumed. Knowledge of HTML, CSS and some JavaScript is required as we expect you to implement the UIs you design.<p>If you&#x27;re at all interested in this area and Helsinki as a place to live and work, drop a one line email with a link to your LinkedIn and GitHub profile (in the case of backend) or portfolio (in the case of UX) to careers-hl@omniata.com","time":1422815069,"type":"comment"}
