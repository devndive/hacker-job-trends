We’re looking for people who enjoy polishing their C++ code to a high sheen and wringing out its last few drops of performance. Sound like you, or like where you want to get to? We encourage everyone excited about making directions better and open to drop us a line at jobs@mapbox.com.","time":1422870930,"type":"comment"}
