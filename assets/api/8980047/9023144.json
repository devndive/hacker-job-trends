You should be able to manage the first 5 Project Euler problems in C, and you should at least be competent to write FizzBuzz, implement a basic singly-linked list, and build a simple unix &#x27;cat&#x27; utility.<p>You should also be somewhat familiar with Unix - comfortable getting work done on either the Linux or OSX command line. Bonus points for any of:<p><pre><code>  - Understands hash tables\n  - Familiarity with Ruby (our tests are written in RSpec)\n  - Experience with data manipulation (text processing, parsing, etc)\n  - Is not afraid of pointers\n  - Can write C Macro wrappers for data structures\n  - Has experience with using SAS, R, SciPy, or Matlab to do data analysis\n</code></pre>\nAn experienced C developer could also apply if interested - you folk are harder to find and hire, but we have no specific requirement for a junior-level salary.<p>You can talk to me (nevinera@gmail.com) if you have any questions, or if you just want a feel for the company.<p>To apply, send a resume and sample C program to devjobs@emcien.com. The sample should be written by you in C, but otherwise can be anything you like - if you have any C projects already public, that will do; otherwise I&#x27;d suggest a basic implementation of unix `cat`, `sort`, or `cut` as a reasonable demonstration of competence.","time":1423510397,"type":"comment"}
