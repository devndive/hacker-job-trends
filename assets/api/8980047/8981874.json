We&#x27;re a small company that has made its money over the past 10 years by doing traditional S&amp;OP consulting, and now we&#x27;re taking that experience and pivoting to becoming a product-based SaaS company.<p>Our company name is boring and our website looks like a stodgy consulting company (because, let&#x27;s face it, that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve been until now). But we&#x27;re coming up with a new name and an entirely new brand (something more befitting of a tech company), and we&#x27;ve got a really awesome product that is already used by several $1B+ companies and is changing the way they think about S&amp;OP.<p>Our tech stack is quite exciting: AngularJS on the frontend (which is most relevant to this job posting), Ruby on Rails, Postgres, and Elasticsearch on the backend.<p>We pay quite well, fully pay for health insurance on a low deductible plan (no monthly premiums for you), and have a great vacation&#x2F;time off policy. Our team is smart and fun to be around.<p>Please get in touch at tech@operationalresults.com if you&#x27;d like more info!","time":1422828837,"type":"comment"}
