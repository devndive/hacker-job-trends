Innovations in these fields have made it possible to organize and campaign more effectively than ever before, but most groups don&#x27;t have the knowledge or ability to take advantage of these advances. We help organizations like Greenpeace, Sierra Club, CREDO, Compassion &amp; Choices, AFL harness these innovations for their work.<p>For us, progressive means more than just the political left. It describes any organization working to help and protect the less fortunate amongst us or to make  life better for the population at large: improving our cities, protecting our environment, encouraging civic engagement, fighting for economic justice, and providing training and opportunities for those who haven&#x27;t traditionally had access to them.
