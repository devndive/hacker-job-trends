Too often, talented programmers don’t get the chance they deserve, just because they don&#x27;t have the typical resume companies look for. We think that’s wrong.<p>So, we are working with a number of startups, including some from Y Combinator, on a new way to hire programmers. Without resumes. Open to anyone. Letting your work speak for itself.<p>Here&#x27;s how it goes:<p>1. No resumes. Apply with code.\nTo get started, we send you a few real coding problems. You write out your answers and we manually review it.<p>2. Pair program with one startup.\nAfter we review your work, you get assigned to one of our partner startups. You’ll pair program and answer a couple technical questions via screen share for an hour. The project you&#x27;ll work on is the same one that everyone uses, so it doesn’t matter which startup you get paired with.<p>3. One interview. Shared with many companies.\nWe share your pair programming session and interview with all our partner startups, including the ones you didn’t interview with. Your work speaks for itself, and any company interested will reach out to you for an on-site interview.<p>Right now, the application is only for <i>front-end engineers</i> at our partner startups.<p>Start applying here: <a href=\"http://goo.gl/forms/dqrrIiy20x\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;forms&#x2F;dqrrIiy20x</a><p>If you want more information, feel free to check out www.symni.com.","time":1422819721,"type":"comment"}
