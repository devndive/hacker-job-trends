We’re building the most consumer friendly “Internet of Things” device that has already won awards and is the most successful crowdfunded consumer product on Indiegogo. We are building a platform that will scale to process more real time video, audio and sensor data than any consumer product on the market.  This is a massive real-time data problem that will change the way people connect to physical places.<p>I lead the mobile team here at Canary and we are looking for Mobile Engineers (1 Android and 1 iOS) to join the team and help us build out our product. Every day we face interesting challenges like:\n- Making security and stability our first priority in every decision we make\n- Streaming full quality HD video from our Canary device to a mobile client while keeping the latency as close to real time as possible\n- Scaling from zero to tens of thousands of paying customers in a matter of months<p>Check out the full details&#x2F;apply here: \niOS: <a href=\"https://boards.greenhouse.io/canary/jobs/18470#.VNFHm1XF8-p\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;canary&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;18470#.VNFHm1XF8-p</a>\nAndroid: <a href=\"https://boards.greenhouse.io/canary/jobs/18465#.VNFHsFXF8-p\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;canary&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;18465#.VNFHsFXF8-p</a><p>Also, we have openings in pretty much every other part of our engineering team.
