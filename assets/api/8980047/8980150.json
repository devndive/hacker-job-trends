We make modular tools for building better maps because we believe that healthy mapping ecosystems are ones that are diverse, sustainable, and accessible to all.<p>We&#x27;re building a geocoder on top of entirely open data. We&#x27;re providing it for use as a hosted service and designed it for modular use and improvement by developers. Geocoding and search are among the most complex problems in open source mapping today, and we believe that the best way to solve those problems is to build open services, software, and community around better search and better data.<p>As product manager, you will help and guide a team of developers toward our feature, quality, and community goals. You&#x27;ll have an understanding of current open datasets (and be on the lookout for new ones) and an interest in figuring out how they can fit together for geocoding. Your perspective is global, with an appreciation for diverse addressing systems and ideas about how to build software that works for everyone. You know how to assess quality search results, and how to investigate and improve results that fall short of user expectations.<p>More info here: <a href=\"https://mapzen.com/jobs/search-product-manager\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapzen.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;search-product-manager</a>","time":1422804142,"type":"comment"}
