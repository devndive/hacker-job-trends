Or in another way of saying it, we can lower both the first and second derivative of the rising health care cost curve, nationwide.  We&#x27;ve got some compelling evidence for it as well if you&#x27;d like to chat.<p>Our tech stack is an SOA&#x2F;microservices mix of Go and Java with an Angular front end.  We&#x27;re strong believers in transparency, trust and balance.  We believe good code is easy to read and should have a short &quot;time to understanding&quot;.  We also believe that shipping is important and there are appropriate times to leverage technical debt.<p>Some of our company-wide values are transparency and a superior customer experience, from the way we design our products and over-indexing on customer support.<p>Our eng team is around 9 and we&#x27;re well funded, but still just a year old, so early enough for non-trivial equity.  We&#x27;ve got a ton of interesting problems to solve.  We expect all of our engineers to teach as well as learn.<p>We&#x27;re looking for experienced SW engineers up and down the stack, front end, back end, data, dev ops, test, generalist, etc.  Full list of available positions: <a href=\"https://jobs.lever.co/collectivehealth\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;collectivehealth</a><p>We&#x27;re super proud of the company mission, engineering culture and tech stack we&#x27;ve put together and would love a chance to explain it all in detail!","time":1422805780,"type":"comment"}
