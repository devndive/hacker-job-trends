We have investment days on Fridays to research the competition, learn new skills, and do things that get us closer to our vision.<p>§ Sustainable Code: We practice BDD. Our code is pristine and we&#x27;re proud of the work we produce.

In that sense, we are a flat organization.<p>§ Design First: We really care about UX and design, and bring 3 to 5 users in every week for user testing so that we stay close to our users. We first design wide, then design deep.<p>Tools include: Ruby on Rails, Postgres, Heroku, RSpec, Factory Girl, CoffeeScript, Konacha &amp; Mocha, Trello, GitHub, git rebase -i, CodeClimate, Gemnasium, and CircleCI.","time":1414893105,"type":"comment"}
