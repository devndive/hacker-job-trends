We’re bringing much needed change to local high-volume delivery restaurants that are still doing delivery the way they’ve always done it. Our restaurants and their customers love the service, and our order volume is surging. You’ll make a real impact working to build and scale Zoomer as we continue to grow to new restaurants and territories.<p>We have amazing investors behind us, including Y Combinator (S14), First Round Capital, SV Angel, CrunchFund, Eric Ries, Gabriel Weinberg, the founder of DuckDuckGo and others.
