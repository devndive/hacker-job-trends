We’re small enough that every customer interaction, every marketing spend, every line of code has an over-sized impact.\n* Equity: we don’t need hired-guns, we need team members. We want to share our long-term vision and success, and make sure you have equity in that journey.\n* Autonomy: we don’t look for specific roles, we look for good fits. You’ll be able to contribute with your strengths and determine the projects you want to drive forward.\n* Flexibility: supporting our chosen lifestyles is major part of our success equation. Join a remote team and create your own hours. Work how and where you want to.\n* Culture: we work hard, but also don’t take ourselves too seriously and make sure we have a great time along the way.","time":1415073362,"type":"comment"}
