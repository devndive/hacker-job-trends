We currently work with over 160 sports teams and concert venues to bring amazing experiences to fans across the country.  Our passion is building fantastic (and award winning<i></i>) products that both fans and teams love.<p>We have some big and interesting technical problems in front of us. How do you determine the market price for an upgrade such that you maximize both the number of fans moved and the revenue generated per game?  How do you predict who will and will not attend the game and allow for fluid seating at an event?<p>Some technologies we use: Groovy&#x2F;Grails, PostgreSql, Redis, BackboneJS, etc. Experience with any of these is not required. We believe a good dev can pick up tools as necessary. We move fast, and we love new challenges and finding the right solution for them.\nContact me directly at: matt [at] expapp.com<p><i></i> Sports Business Journal - Best In Technology (<a href=\"http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/SB-Blogs/On-The-Ground/2014/05/0521-Technology.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sportsbusinessdaily.com&#x2F;SB-Blogs&#x2F;On-The-Ground&#x2F;20...</a>)","time":1415060391,"type":"comment"}
