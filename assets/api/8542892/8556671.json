If you know, or want to learn erlang, even better.<p>Smarkets is a modern betting exchange with significantly lower transaction fees than the competition. We&#x27;re a well-funded company with a small, agile development team, and our platform has handled over Â£600 million of bets since launching in 2010. Smarkets has been featured in publications such as Wired, The Wall Street Journal and TechCrunch and was recently selected as part of the Startups 100.<p>We are taking on the big players in the betting industry with the lean startup playbook. We think the commission charged by such players is too high, spelling for opportunity to do better.<p>We&#x27;re building a reliable, low-latency, highly concurrent betting exchange based on trading exchange designs. We&#x27;re also building a fast, modern web interface to allow for a smoother experience. Servicing our users is top priority. Whether you want to work on the trading exchange or the frontend, you&#x27;ll be solving real and challenging problems - from scaling to optimising python to handling near real-time design constraints.<p>The Smarkets platform is written predominantly on Python and Erlang, and relies heavily on asynchronous programming techniques. We use REST where we can. Life at Smarkets circles around version control, configuration management and automated testing. We can, and do, deploy to production several times a day.<p>Our software stack is built around Linux, Vagrant, Flask, Eventlet, Postgres, RabbitMQ, Git and Chef - but we are not resistant to change as needed.<p>To see all our jobs, visit: <a href=\"http://info.smarkets.com/about/jobs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;info.smarkets.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a>","time":1415112295,"type":"comment"}
