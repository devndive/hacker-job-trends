We’re Pathgather, a Techstars NYC 2014 startup looking for a Senior Frontend Engineer, a Javascript expert that can come in and own one of the most engaging interfaces in the enterprise market today.<p>Our product is an enterprise learning platform that - unlike traditional learning systems - is one employees actually want to use. We’re solving a big problem felt by almost all large and fast-growing companies: how to continuously train and educate your workforce with modern content on a system built for today’s employee. More than 75% of all companies use a Learning Management System (LMS) in hopes to help with this problem, but their &gt; 60% dissatisfaction rate shows these systems simply don’t work. We’re changing that.<p>We launched earlier this year and our product is already in use by tens of thousands of employees at some of the world’s most recognizable brands: Qualcomm and HBO, to name a couple (we’re also about to launch within one of the world’s largest companies). We’re a small team, but we’ve got investment capital in the bank, real revenue coming in the door, and are now looking for the right person who is ready to take ownership of our frontend.<p>What we’re looking for:<p>* Javascript&#x2F;Coffeescript expertise<p>* Strong experience with AngularJS<p>* Mastery of CSS &amp; HTML<p>* UX focus<p>* Design skills a huge bonus<p>* Ruby&#x2F;Rails knowledge another bonus, but certainly supplemental<p>What we can offer:<p>* A (more than) competitive salary &amp; equity<p>* Opportunities to contribute to the open source community. Every Friday, you have the opportunity to work on anything open source: you can contribute to existing projects, work on your own, or open source a part of our codebase. We’ve already open sourced our recommendation and prediction engine (<a href=\"https://github.com/Pathgather/predictor\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Pathgather&#x2F;predictor</a>) and would love to do more!<p>* An awesome team to work with, in an awesome location! We work in the Techstars NYC office with several of New York’s most promising startups.<p>* A chance to have a truly influential role at a company with an ambitious mission: to foster a culture of learning and continual improvement within every workforce through an engaging, rewarding, and collaborative learning platform.<p>If any of this sounds interesting or if you have some questions, please reach out to me at jamie@pathgather.com.
