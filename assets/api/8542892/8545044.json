For jobs, we believe in transparency (all jobs have salary and equity ranges disclosed).<p>This model has led to tremendous growth, but we still have a lot to do. There&#x27;s room here for any engineer or designer to have a huge impact on the next iteration of AngelList Talent and therefore change the lives of thousands of other engineers and designers.<p>Apply via AngelList and mention that you saw Mike&#x27;s message on Hacker News.","time":1414885752,"type":"comment"}
