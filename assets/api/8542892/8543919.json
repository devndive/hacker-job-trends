An even larger, chaotic bust followed, with losses of $2.8 trillion, along with the homes of more than 14 million Americans. While the economy has since improved, many processes within the mortgage industry have not. Gains have been made primarily in paperwork and manpower, not technology. Operations remain manual and slow and consumers are not happy.<p>At Blend, we&#x27;re fixing these problems by replacing the archaic software and manual processes currently used for home lending.  We&#x27;re applying modern data analysis tools and consumer-grade UI&#x2F;UX to streamline home lending for both borrowers and banks and make the entire process more transparent.<p>Our team of 20 includes engineers formerly at Palantir, Google, Stanford, CMU, and Caltech. We&#x27;re backed by Peter Thiel, Formation 8, Andreessen Horowitz, Max Levchin, Lightspeed Ventures, and other prominent investors. Our stack includes NodeJS, Spark, AngularJS, ElasticSearch, and Golang.<p><a href=\"https://blendlabs.com/jobs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blendlabs.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a>","time":1414864613,"type":"comment"}
