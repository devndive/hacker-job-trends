Opportunity for 10%+ equity and rev share.<p>We started in January, but are already booking solid revenues and growing rapidly. This is a great opportunity to get in on the ground level. You&#x27;ll get to work closely with the founders who have started (and sold) businesses as well as led teams at top companies like YouTube and Google. You&#x27;ll have an immediate and big impact on the company and culture we&#x27;re building.  You should have previous founder or exec experience and be interested in building a bootstrapped business. We&#x27;ve got most of the engineering, design and user acquisition pieces in place, and are now looking for someone who&#x27;s passionate about managing the ops team (negotiators, customer success, biz dev).
