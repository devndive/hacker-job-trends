Our fullstack position is frontend-heavy, so it&#x27;s also perfect for someone who is UI&#x2F;UX-oriented but also wants to become better rounded. It can also work for someone who is traditionally a backend-er and wants to see what all the hype in the frontend is about. Our base expectation is a solid foundation in programming, and we&#x27;re off to a great start. You&#x27;ll fit in perfectly to our team if:<p>- You not only love coding, but also take the time to reflect on the benefits and drawbacks of your tools, be they frameworks, languages, or processes.<p>- You strive for clean code, but also know how to make your &quot;shortcuts&quot; easy to delete in a crunch.<p>- You know what to test, why to test it, and how to write flexible tests that won&#x27;t break with minor changes.<p>- You&#x27;re comfortable with Linux and know how to get things done on the command line, including on remote servers.<p>- You&#x27;re not afraid to use Google or ask for help when something is beyond your grasp.<p>- You care about user interaction, usability, and of course â€“ making the interface beautiful.<p>- In general, technology excites you and you strive to learn something on a daily basis!<p>We&#x27;re working on an Angular 1.6 app, and transitioning sections of it to React.
