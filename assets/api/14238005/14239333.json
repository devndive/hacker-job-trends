Our core product, C55, helps companies decide which projects to invest in, how to reduce their risk, increase safety, and reduce their environmental impact. We are one of the top 20 Fastest-Growing Software Companies in Canada and winner of the BC Tech 2016 Emerging Company of the Year Award. We are also working on two new cloud-based products, to be released this year.<p>We have grown a lot in the last year, and we are still looking to fill a senior role on one of the new &quot;cloud&quot; technology teams. The project&#x27;s stack includes NodeJS, Angular (2+), Kendo, and Postgres. We&#x27;d like to find an experienced front-end developer, who can take on a leadership role with the front-end architecture and mentor junior developers. (This team is also looking for a junior-to-intermediate level manual QA tester.)<p>I joined Copperleaf (as a senior developer) back in April 2016. The people here are really nice, they care about what they do, and they have a lot of domain knowledge. If any of that sounds interesting to you, please fire off an e-mail to me (Tom) at thauk@copperleaf.com and we can chat a bit more!","time":1493658436,"type":"comment"}
