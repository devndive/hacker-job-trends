We&#x27;re growing quickly, with 70MM registered members, and are self-funded to 100+ employees, so we&#x27;re highly focused on data-driven decisions and making smart capacity investments for the future. We&#x27;ve just been voted one of Boston Business Journal&#x27;s Best Places to Work (again!).<p>Recruiting for multiple roles, especially:<p><i>Platform engineer</i> - Build all our core systems (including interesting architecture&#x2F;scaling problems), working on a well-documented code base in a team with a strong review culture and very clear communications. We use a Java&#x2F;Hibernate stack; happy to talk to people with experience in comparable technologies.<p><i>Data science &#x2F; analytics &#x2F; information retrieval</i> - Help our members find relevant advice and jobs, and our colleagues make good decisions. Have a direct impact on revenue and on engagement, working with a team that&#x27;s making major optimizations for our members and with colleagues who are uniformly data-savvy.<p>Interview process is a phone screen, then onsite interviews, with onsite design exercise and&#x2F;or take-home coding&#x2F;analysis exercise. Happy to answer questions, jberk at jobcase.com - my team works pretty closely with both of those teams.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jobcase.com&#x2F;locations&#x2F;4Od3KKqq7pBUVSLdOt5YCwfo&#x2F;nzrsagNgjg18QzdOKcLpbpvq&#x2F;jobcase-cambridge-201-broadway&#x2F;apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jobcase.com&#x2F;locations&#x2F;4Od3KKqq7pBUVSLdOt5YCwfo&#x2F;nz...</a>","time":1493675948,"type":"comment"}
