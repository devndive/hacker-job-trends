In order to provide that insight, we have to collect the data, which is where our instrumentation agent team comes into play.<p>The agents that feed TraceView’s analytics run inside customer application processes, automatically instrumenting them to gather distributed tracing data and other performance analytics, while having minimal or no performance impact so they’re safe to run in high-traffic production environments.<p>We’re looking for someone who’s immersed in the Node.js ecosystem--with bonus points for fluency in Ruby, Python, or Go, and really wow us if you have a systems generalist bent. You’ll be combining an eye for performance with digging into the intricacies of V8 and native extensions.
