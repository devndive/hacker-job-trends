We&#x27;re looking to grow our software team of currently six engineers (including myself) to support the rapid adoption of our technology. We&#x27;ve seen a growing number of high profile publications that use our technology (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;publications&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;publications&#x2F;</a>).<p>Recently, the team that works on Supernova, our in-house de novo genome assembler, published a paper on a new push button algorithm that allows determination of the human diploid genome from about 1ng of high molecular weight DNA! [1] Typically, researchers still use a haploid representation of the genome and previously only two other true diploid de novo human genomes have been made.<p>You can also read about (and run if you&#x27;d like) our massively parallel pipelines at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;</a>. We manage our pipelines with Go, develop analysis code using the NumPy stack, and drive our front-end applications with React&#x2F;Redux (previously Angular 1), but we&#x27;re always open to any technology that allows us to develop faster. No previous biological experience is required; we have plenty of computational biologists here to handle that, but there is a lot to learn about if you&#x27;re curious. You&#x27;ll work with a group of humble engineers that are alums of YC, MIT, Harvard, Caltech, Google, Facebook, and more.<p>We&#x27;re currently hiring for several software roles, but specifically for generalists, UI engineers, QA engineers, and infrastructure engineers. Our computational biology group is also always looking for bioinformaticians who are experienced with NGS, and our company is always looking for scientists and engineers (hardware included). Here are some of the job postings we have up, but feel free to email me if you think you&#x27;re a good fit for another role.<p>- UI Engineer - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;274522&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;274522&#x2F;</a>\n- Linux &#x2F; Infrastructure Engineer - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;537730&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;537730&#x2F;</a>\n- Software Quality Engineer - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;476114&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;476114&#x2F;</a>\n- Software Quality Engineer (Computational Biology) - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;472908&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;472908&#x2F;</a>\n- IT Support Engineer - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;625410&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;625410&#x2F;</a><p>Just a note that we do have an office in San Francisco even though the listings only specify Pleasanton.
