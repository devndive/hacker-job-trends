Short version; No heros, no assholes, do a good job, and build stuff that allows you to sleep at night under reasonably high load.  We are also a remote first team and have an emphasis on learning and development.<p>The hiring process is mostly blind and is designed to match how we work on a day-to-day basis.  There are no whiteboard sessions or brain-teasers.","time":1493668493,"type":"comment"}
