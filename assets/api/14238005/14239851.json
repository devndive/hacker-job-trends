The other half of their time is spent working directly with partners to develop and execute their Facebook technology strategy.<p>We find that this setup is great for engineers that want to spend more time on the business side of things or have more people interaction while still being hands on with code.<p>This allows large advertisers to work directly with people at Facebook that have a knowledge of the ads codebase, and Solutions Engineers can implement great suggestions made by partners.<p>More about the role is available at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;life&#x2F;solutions-engineering-at-facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;life&#x2F;solutions-engineering-...</a> .<p>Facebook | Solutions Engineering Manager | Menlo Park, Berlin | Onsite<p>We also have some great opportunities for engineering managers that would like to support a team in Menlo Park or Berlin.
