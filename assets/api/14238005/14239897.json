We&#x27;re on a mission to build companion intelligence through working models of natural systems.<p>Some of the things we&#x27;ve built and are working on: Multi-agent operating systems with federated learning and inference pipelines, Multi-agent transactions (temporal-based stateful sessions), Agent-to-agent (bot-to-bot) communications, Deep learning + Models as a service.<p>We&#x27;re looking for people who want to build stuff that enables us to ask more questions and maybe even answer a few. Our big vision is to help figure out why we&#x27;re all here and what it all means.<p>Baqqer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baqqer.com&#x2F;users&#x2F;dan-gailey\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baqqer.com&#x2F;users&#x2F;dan-gailey</a>\nTwitter: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;dpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;dpg</a>\nEmail: dan@radbots.com","time":1493661896,"type":"comment"}
