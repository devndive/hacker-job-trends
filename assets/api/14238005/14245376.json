We&#x27;re small enough that you will have a big impact, but there&#x27;s still plenty of career opportunities within the rest of Schibsted.\nWe&#x27;re looking for a senior engineer that is very experienced with javascript and node.js (or so good at other stuff and willing to learn that it doesn&#x27;t matter). The rest of our stack consists of Postgresql and Elastic Search, virtual-dom, Heroku, Varnish, and AWS (RDS, S3, SNS, SQS).\nHowever, we&#x27;re constantly experimenting and innovating and no strangers to trying new technology when we get a good opportunity (personally I can&#x27;t wait to use Elm in production; we just need more devs who knows it!).\nWe write plenty of tests, do code reviews always, and have the ambition to do pair&#x2F;mob programming more regularly.\nEmail me at andreas@omni.se if you&#x27;re interested.<p>PS. For The Right Candidate we are willing to help with relocation to one of Schibsted&#x27;s hubs (Stockholm, Gdansk, or Oslo).","time":1493722387,"type":"comment"}
