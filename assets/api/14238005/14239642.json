We know that this is not necessarily a new world, as propaganda has always been around, but the sheer scale and reach of it in the digital era calls for a drastically new approach. PROTAGONIST is a such approach.<p>Even though we believe in facts and their validity over non-facts, we don&#x27;t believe detecting real vs. fake news is the key to understanding the post-factual world. Instead, we&#x27;re much more interested in people&#x27;s _beliefs_ regardless of whether or not those beliefs are true. We think people are guided by what they believe to be true, not necessarily by what is objectively true.\nTo that end we have built PROTAGONIST, a machine-learning-powered analytical engine that takes a novel approach to computational linguistics and natural language processing. We have proprietary algorithms that can detect various patterns of subjective language that is indicative of an underlying belief. We call these NARRATIVE patterns and are convinced they hold the key to &quot;mining for beliefs&quot; in the vast and wild media jungle.<p>Interested to hear more?
