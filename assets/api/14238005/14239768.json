We have over 70 million US members and are a true mission-oriented business, a rare case where our incentives are aligned with our users - we succeed by helping our members attain financial progress.<p>We&#x27;ve been growing rapidly over the past few years (hypergrowth) and are hiring across a wide range of positions. On the backend side, we are moving to Scala-based microservices using finagle and Thrift, and as well as GraphQL on node.js. Our native iOS and Android apps are #1 in finance (with a 5 star rating on the App Store) and we&#x27;re rebuilding our website in React + Redux. Our data teams use Kafka, Spark and BigQuery among other technologies.<p>If you&#x27;re motivated by growth and impact Credit Karma is probably the best place to work in tech today. We have solved product &#x2F; market fit and distribution, but compared to our peer unicorns there is still so much work to do. If you look at the gap between our product today and what we are well-positioned to become - the main touchpoint for consumer finance - there is tons of opportunity for people joining now to take on responsibility and ownership and have a meaningful impact.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.creditkarma.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.creditkarma.com&#x2F;careers</a>","time":1493660945,"type":"comment"}
