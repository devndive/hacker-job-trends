I&#x27;m building out the team (currently a team of me) as our trajectory keeps going up and to the right. One of our big projects this year is getting our infrastructure running outside of AWS due to country privacy laws. In particular, I&#x27;m looking for three areas of expertise (you do <i>not</i> have to have experience in all three of these areas):<p>1) Configuring and administering Containers &#x2F; Docker &#x2F; Kubernetes.<p>2) Installing, configuring, and administering some of the following: Hadoop &#x2F; Hive &#x2F; HDFS, RabbitMQ, Kafka, Memcached, Redis, PostgreSQL.<p>3) Networking experience, including configuring and administering VPN connections with external partners using software like strongSwan.<p>We&#x27;re in San Francisco in the Financial District, looking to hire locally with an eye on remote as we grow, so an exceptional remote candidate may be considered.<p>Apply online (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;juvo.com&#x2F;job&#x2F;devops-engineer&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;juvo.com&#x2F;job&#x2F;devops-engineer&#x2F;</a>) or contact me via email (pete@juvo.com) for more information.","time":1493656793,"type":"comment"}
