These are TVs made by our partners that have the whole software experience driven by Roku OS.  Our group works on the whole system, including  SoC and board bring-up, implementing TV-specific features (think tuners and HDMI sourcing and CEC and picture quality tuning), implementing streaming media technology and graphics, and working on optimizing the manufacturing and setup flow.  We primarily work in fairly modern C++ with some ARM&#x2F;MIPS&#x2F;8051 assembly and some higher-level scripting.  Experience with the TV technology stack and with embedded Linux for consumer electronics are big plusses, as well as experience building and working with secure systems.<p>We&#x27;re also always looking for great QA engineers at all of our locations; we try to keep a fairly high ratio between dev and QA and work closely with them through our development process.<p>Our main company dev team is in Los Gatos, CA, and we&#x27;ve also got a big group in Cambridge, England and a smaller team in Shanghai, China that focuses on working with our factory partners.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.roku.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.roku.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a> has all of our job listings, including non-technical ones.","time":1493655030,"type":"comment"}
