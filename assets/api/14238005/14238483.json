Plaid&#x27;s goal is to enable this shift by building the tools and infrastructure that allow developers to create the next generation of financial services applications. Today, hundreds of companies such as Robinhood, Stripe, and Venmo rely on Plaid to integrate with banks and the financial system.<p>Plaidâ€™s infrastructure handles millions of requests per day and thousands of bank integrations, and we pride ourselves on maintaining a robust API to support the developers who depend on us -- and the millions of consumers who use their apps.  Our API and most of our services are written in Go and Typescript. Our infrastructure is built on top of AWS, Elasticsearch, Redshift, S3, Spark -- and although we love trying new technology as individuals, as a team we are pragmatic in our choices, favoring the right tool and not necessarily the flavor of the month.<p>If you are interested in any of our roles please reach out to me over email - jgreze __at__ plaid.com<p>Here is a link to our job postings: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plaid.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plaid.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a><p>We&#x27;re also hiring a designer, a product manager, and an engineering manager.","time":1493653495,"type":"comment"}
