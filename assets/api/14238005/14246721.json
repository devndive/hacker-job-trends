Launched last year, 8 person core team, venture-backed, growing quickly. (Here’s the app: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;meditation-for-fidgety-skeptics&#x2F;id992210239?mt=8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;meditation-for-fidgety-skept...</a> )<p>We&#x27;re looking for a lead iOS developer excited by the challenges of building a fast-growing + consumer mobile + meditation startup.<p>You&#x27;re likely an iOS specialist (who has shipped product iOS apps), with strong product sensibilities (i.e. you have strong opinions for how things should work, and don&#x27;t need all the details to get something shipped). In addition to leading the technical direction of the iOS app, you&#x27;ll also help establish a strong engineering culture - mentoring, development process, etc. Last but not least, you&#x27;ll work on a product that actually makes people&#x27;s lives better. (If you don&#x27;t believe us, take a look at our reviews on the App Store.)<p>The product is our iOS app. It’s built in Swift &amp; ReactiveCocoa. Our web-back end is Ruby on Rails and Postgres, all living atop Heroku. If you’re interested in functional programming &amp; clean, readable code, we think you’ll like what you see - but we’d prefer it if you helped us make it better still.<p>The interview process involves a 30min call, and two 2hr interviews (followed by reference checks and conversations to answer any questions you have).<p>Email jeff@ (10percenthappier.com) if you’re interested.","time":1493736241,"type":"comment"}
