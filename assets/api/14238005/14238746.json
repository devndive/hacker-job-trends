You can think of it as the next generation Microsoft Office meets Minecraft (and actually a visual programming language behind the scene).\nWe made a graphic novel about why we exist.

The business is growing fast. We have a beautiful artist loft in the SF Mission district, with the best investors out there (notion.so&#x2F;investors). You need to be able to build things and think conceptually.\nEmail me directly at &quot;ivan@makenotion.com&quot;\nHave a good one.","time":1493654891,"type":"comment"}
