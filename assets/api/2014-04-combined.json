We currently have 2 devs on mac and 1 on PC.\n\n    Office style: Open floor plan, collaborative working environment, very casual.\n\n    Dev methodologies: We borrow elements of various frameworks, but in general we work in monthly sprint cycles, daily stand-ups, weekly overview meetings.\n\n    Hours: The dev team likes to have people here by 10am most days.\n</code></pre>\nA word about Detroit: The city gets a lot of bad press. It might not look like an attractive option to people who are considering offers from NY or CA, but I would really encourage people to at least take a look. We&#x27;re in a building with about 20 other tech start-ups who have all received funding.  There is serious investment happening in the city right now. Two months ago I looked up and Warren Buffet (completely unannounced) was 10 feet away from my desk (he&#x27;s partnering on several projects in the city). We sit right across from the Detroit Twitter office. We&#x27;re on the same block as the Detroit Google office. Comerica Park, where the Detroit Tigers play, is 100 yards from our office. Ford Field, where the Lions play, is another about 300 yards away. The part of the city we&#x27;re in is clean and safe with newly built downtown living alternatives. All I&#x27;m saying is: give it a look.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in finding out more, shoot me an email at evan@chalkfly.com.","time":1396358567,"type":"comment"},{"by":"onalark","id":7508600,"parent":7507765,"text":"Delhi (Other areas negotiable), India<p>Systems Developer, CycleTel<p>Are you passionate about using technology to create social impact?

We also have a strong focus on product and design (take a look at our product, and we think you&#x27;ll agree). Traditionally, enterprise software has lacked in these areas, but we aim to disrupt that tradition.<p>If you&#x27;re at all interested or curious in exploring an opportunity with us, please don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out to me at jamie@pathgather.com.

Today, I am 13 and wrapping up my second semester of it, and with an A+, too, thanks largely in part to this site. Sal, I would say you are the best teacher I ever had. Teachers in school just don&#x27;t seem to have the time or, in some cases, even the knowledge to pay as much attention as you do to the actual intuition of the material being taught. How am I supposed to understand a theorem if I don&#x27;t know where it came from, why it works, or even what it really means? Khan Academy also seems to explain everything in a very easy to understand, and even fun, manor. You make calculus almost as easy as simple arithmetic. Anyway, thank you very much.<p>==================================<p>Every month we get hundreds of letters like this from people in all walks of life who&#x27;re thankful for our free, high-quality educational content.<p>Most of you reading this are familiar with Sal&#x27;s videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site.<p>And now we&#x27;re doing a big mobile push. Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets. We&#x27;re totally overhauling our iOS app and we now need a great mobile designer.

Even if you don&#x27;t have experience with everything listed in this ad, we offer excellent learning opportunities for those who are eager to expand their skill sets.\nJob Responsibilities<p>Working in small development teams, programmers participate in the architecture, design, and implementation of primarily Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, and PHP code to meet client requirements for robust, high-performance, and secure sites and applications. Developers get exposure to several client projects and a variety of technologies over time.\nJob Qualifications<p>In addition to overall programming capability, candidates must have experience working on collaborative development teams and very strong communication skills. While we employ and enjoy the company of extroverts and introverts alike, we reiterate that the ability to communicate clearly is a must-have for our technical staff. That means writing professional e-mails and interpreting the nuances of clients&#x27; requirements by asking good questions, for example.<p>We work hard to estimate projects accurately so that schedules are reasonable and developers work a normal amount of hours per week. We rely on developers to contribute to those estimates and provide feedback as a project goes along to keep things on track.<p>Ideal candidates will have experience building all facets of software systems including the data model, business logic, and front-end. 3+ years of object-oriented design and development in Java, JavaScript, Python, or Ruby is desired.

As a member of our team you will be given a lot of autonomy to choose projects that interest you the most and the ability to make product decisions with our CTO Ben Lund and CEO Richard Price.<p>We are currently tackling five incredibly difficult product challenges.  Some of these projects have been attempted by larger companies and have failed.  In order to be successful we will need to think way outside-of-the-box and take a leap into the unknown…<p>Peer Review<p>We want to build a peer review platform that allows layers of discussion on top of a single document.  One of the biggest challenges we face is that contextual commenting at a large scale has yet to be achieved.  In order to be successful we need to find original and novel solutions because simple approaches like putting a blog-style comment box at the end of the paper has been tried before and has not been effective.<p>To build Peer Review we must figure out a way to transform all the wide array of styles from any given PDF paper to a clean and consistent format that is embedded for a suitable commenting UI.  We are experimenting to build a rich inline-commenting and discussion interface as well as a reputation system that surfaces quality comments.<p>Interface Design<p>We currently have 7.5 million users who upload their research papers.  Academia converts these PDFs to HTLM5 to display in the browser.  We face the challenges of building web UIs for scientific content such as 3D molecular visualizations and tools for exploring genetic sequences.  We will also build back-end parsers, converters, and storage schemes to enable these UIs.<p>Recommendation Engine<p>We have a news feed that displays recommended papers to our users.  Currently we use a simple rule-based system where papers are tagged by research interests and our users can follow those research interests.  In addition, our users can follow each other.  We want our users to feel as if they are attending an amazing conference where everything we show them is the most relevant and up-to-date information that is available in their field.<p>In order to improve our recommendation engine, we will be immersed in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.  We want to identify which particular field of the paper it correlates to (math, biochemistry, anthropology, etc.) and the type of document (original research, a review article, a conference presentation, a lecture note or some other content).  Using everything from a paper’s previous viewers on Academia.edu to its author and content to its place in the citation graph, we want to determine the relevance of a particular document to a particular user.  Lastly, using large-scale data analysis we want to identify trending papers, highlight influential researchers and help the public uncover important new work more quickly and reliably.<p>Mobile App<p>Academia does not have a mobile app but we are dedicated to building one!<p>Working with a clean slate, we will design and build a mobile API that displays Academia’s core features.  These features will include the user profile, upload papers, news feed, analytic data, and the ability to make comments on papers (Peer Review).  In order to build a dynamic mobile API, we will write easy-to-use client libraries in a wide range of scripting languages that will encourage integration with Academia’s data, content and identity into their apps.<p>Speed, Scale, &amp; Storage<p>Our engineering team will have to build highly scalable systems that effectively store and analyze our entire stream of hits.  We have built an analytics dashboard so that every user can see how many people viewed their profile and how many people have read their uploaded papers.  We enabled this feature by storing structured data in DynamoDB- currently 343 million rows and growing 10% per month.  We want to build features that require more sophisticated aggregations on this data than DynamoDB can provide.<p>Furthermore we will need to figure out how to effectively store massive amounts of data while increasing the speed of our product especially to parts of the world where there is slower internet connections.  This is important because areas in the world with slower connections tend to be where researchers can benefit the most from open access to research.  Our platform must be useable for them too.<p>Future at Academia.edu<p>We have a fun and agile team and we are growing (our site usage grows 10% per month)!  We have the resources to make our mission come true.  We just raised $11 million from Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures.

How can we liberate these items and put them back into good use? How can we make sharing the new shopping?  This is why yerdle exists.  We help the world exchange second-hand goods for free. 80% of things in our homes are used once per month or less. The average power drill sees 6 minutes of use in its entire lifetime. There&#x27;s 3 billion ft² of self-storage space in the United States. That&#x27;s, like, two San Franciscos of usable stuff—just sitting there.  Yerdle is changing that. People on yerdle give away everything from kid’s clothes to kitchen tools and electronics. And we make it easier to get something re-used rather than buy new. We aim to replace 25% of new purchases with free, second-hand goods from others. In the process, we&#x27;re helping people save money and encouraging manufacturers to make better products.  We&#x27;re looking for people who are passionate about our vision and who want to use their skills to make the world a better place.<p><pre><code>    === Team and Culture ===\n</code></pre>\nWe&#x27;ve been called &#x27;unrepentant hippies&#x27;—and that&#x27;s fine with us.

It&#x27;s a close-knit team, we like to pair, and we teach each other every day.  We have solid funding through incredible firms such as The Westly Group and Claremont Creek as well as angels with deep expertise such as Lisa Gansky, Adam Lowry and Andy Rappaport.<p><pre><code>    === Workflow and Process ===\n</code></pre>\nWe&#x27;re agile, we do daily standup, regular one-on-ones and project retrospectives, and we have fun together—rock climbing, surfing, and hanging out after work over beers. As an engineer at yerdle, you&#x27;re more than a coder. You will influence the product&#x27;s direction, bring brilliant ideas and execute them.  We are polyglots, and most of our software is in Ruby, Objective-C, and JavaScript. We love to pair and we often let tests drive our development. And we code small (see our blog: <a href=\"http://codesmaller.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;codesmaller.com</a>).<p><pre><code>    === Hours and Schedule ===\n</code></pre>\nThe day starts around 9am and we have a standup meeting at 10.

You know that they can make the difference between easily understandable and maintainable code, and a spaghetti mess. - You think about edge cases and performance implications, and anticipate future needs. - You read and understand existing code before diving in and adding your own. You re-use existing code whenever possible, cleaning it up as needed to be more generally useful. - You know when to do it fast, when to do it right, and how to find the best compromise between the two. - You recognize that we are all stewards of the codebase, not owners. You leave code better than you found it, and you fix bugs without grumbling about whose they are. - You are a team player who enjoys discussing ideas and implementations with other engineers.\nHere’s a small sampling of the things you will be working on as a member of the Prismatic backend team:\n- Making our crawlers and document analysis better and more comprehensive - Building out new product features in our API - Solving tough systems problems to help us scale reliably and robustly - Building and improving Machine Learning systems for ranking, document analysis, and more - Creating tools to assist development and ops - Shipping some of the best open-source Clojure libraries out there, and working with the community to make them better<p>We are also looking for designers, visual and&#x2F;or interaction.","time":1396423109,"type":"comment"},{"by":"enoren","id":7513736,"parent":7507765,"text":"StepOne, Inc (<a href=\"http://www.steponeinc.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.steponeinc.com</a>) - Austin, TX - INTERN, FULLTIME<p>Come be employee #5 before we get to #18 by the end of the year!

Working in an increasingly connected life, the role looks a little something like this:<p>1st class engineer <p>You will be used to working as part of an unsilo’d production team, where designers work alongside developers, in agile sprints where they’re useful. Your main skill set is writing PHP but you may have experience with other languages (like JavaScript&#x2F;Node.js, Go, Objective C or Java) that has influenced how you code. You’ll be familiar with PHP frameworks, such as Symfony, Laravel, Aura &amp; Zend, and building on top of content management systems, such as WordPress. You’ll be comfortable with object orientated design patterns, unit testing, APIs &amp; databases. Every pony at Base is capable of more than one trick. You’ll have an understanding of usability and how that works with functionality<p>Data hungry <p>You’ll have a keen interest in datasets, with good skills in filtering the signals from the noise. You’ll have an eye to the future and know that tracking something now will make for way more interesting times later. You’ll be comfortable integrating 3rd party systems through APIs you’ve helped architect.<p>Open all hours <p>You’ll have a keen interest in the way openness in technology (and in particular open data) can change things. And you’ll have ideas that mash one set with another, whether you’ve realised them yet or not. Our developers come up with projects for our clients, rarely the other way round.<p>Solver of riddles <p>You won’t know the answer to every question that comes your way, but you’ll be someone who knows how to hunt it down. This job isn’t forensic science, but being able to piece the jigsaw back together and crack the nut is your daily bread. Inquisitive by nature you, like us, want to understand what makes things tick to make them better.<p>Getting shit done <p>You’ll understand technical debt and be acutely aware that most pieces of code aren’t perfect, but you’ll be good at balancing the need to do something beautifully and the need to do it fast, including both where you can. You’ll regularly use Git, bash scripting and Sass, or similar, because of what they bring to the table.<p>Commercially aware <p>You will be able to develop a genuine understanding of our client businesses, allowing you to identify opportunities for and with them. The best developers understand the end goal, not just their role in a project. You’ll be able to think commercially about the client business, as well as deliver work that doesn’t fall over as its user base scales. You’ll be expected to apply innovation to solve challenges, remembering that the best solutions are often beautiful in their simplicity.<p>Keen eye, tuned ear <p>An eye for detail and a high standard of output is important to the success of the role. We’ve developed a code standard that gives us a bar to reach for. You’ll play a part in developing and guiding it as we grow. You’ll know that most project budgets don’t allow interface designers to cover every inch of an application, so you’re good at communicating with them and finding ways to smartly join the dots with a minimum of fuss.<p>Security and speed <p>You’ll be hot on security too. The one thing that no one sees, until it goes to the wall. Then everyone knows about it. You’ll know how to react when an overseas friend tries to gain access to one of your servers from your years of ethical hacking. Creating applications that are quick is fundamental to the role too. An understanding of devices, connections and optimisation is key to delivering the quality we’re after. But then you already know that.<p>About We Are Base<p>We&#x27;re a digital service design company that builds user-centred digital services for businesses, using data they already have.<p>We help our clients realise opportunities by transforming their data into something new and valuable. Clients include Timex, Garmin and Nottingham City Transport.<p>At Base you will be part of a team of makers and doers, working across a variety of projects and clients. We’re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.<p>We value and support CPD, actively seeking clients with a like-minded desire to push boundaries, providing you with an opportunity to build your experience and skills.<p>We practice a sustainable pace, recognising that we each have lives and families outside of work.

As a member of our team you will be given a lot of autonomy to choose projects that interest you the most and the ability to make product decisions with our CTO Ben Lund and CEO Richard Price.<p>We are currently tackling five incredibly difficult product challenges.  Some of these projects have been attempted by larger companies and have failed.  In order to be successful we will need to think way outside-of-the-box and take a leap into the unknown…<p>Peer Review<p>We want to build a peer review platform that allows layers of discussion on top of a single document.  One of the biggest challenges we face is that contextual commenting at a large scale has yet to be achieved.  In order to be successful we need to find original and novel solutions because simple approaches like putting a blog-style comment box at the end of the paper has been tried before and has not been effective.<p>To build Peer Review we must figure out a way to transform all the wide array of styles from any given PDF paper to a clean and consistent format that is embedded for a suitable commenting UI.  We are experimenting to build a rich inline-commenting and discussion interface as well as a reputation system that surfaces quality comments.<p>Interface Design<p>We currently have 7.5 million users who upload their research papers.  Academia converts these PDFs to HTLM5 to display in the browser.  We face the challenges of building web UIs for scientific content such as 3D molecular visualizations and tools for exploring genetic sequences.  We will also build back-end parsers, converters, and storage schemes to enable these UIs.<p>Recommendation Engine<p>We have a news feed that displays recommended papers to our users.  Currently we use a simple rule-based system where papers are tagged by research interests and our users can follow those research interests.  In addition, our users can follow each other.  We want our users to feel as if they are attending an amazing conference where everything we show them is the most relevant and up-to-date information that is available in their field.<p>In order to improve our recommendation engine, we will be immersed in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.  We want to identify which particular field of the paper it correlates to (math, biochemistry, anthropology, etc.) and the type of document (original research, a review article, a conference presentation, a lecture note or some other content).  Using everything from a paper’s previous viewers on Academia.edu to its author and content to its place in the citation graph, we want to determine the relevance of a particular document to a particular user.  Lastly, using large-scale data analysis we want to identify trending papers, highlight influential researchers and help the public uncover important new work more quickly and reliably.<p>Mobile App<p>Academia does not have a mobile app but we are dedicated to building one!<p>Working with a clean slate, we will design and build a mobile API that displays Academia’s core features.  These features will include the user profile, upload papers, news feed, analytic data, and the ability to make comments on papers (Peer Review).  In order to build a dynamic mobile API, we will write easy-to-use client libraries in a wide range of scripting languages that will encourage integration with Academia’s data, content and identity into their apps.<p>Speed, Scale, &amp; Storage<p>Our engineering team will have to build highly scalable systems that effectively store and analyze our entire stream of hits.  We have built an analytics dashboard so that every user can see how many people viewed their profile and how many people have read their uploaded papers.  We enabled this feature by storing structured data in DynamoDB- currently 343 million rows and growing 10% per month.  We want to build features that require more sophisticated aggregations on this data than DynamoDB can provide.<p>Furthermore we will need to figure out how to effectively store massive amounts of data while increasing the speed of our product especially to parts of the world where there is slower internet connections.  This is important because areas in the world with slower connections tend to be where researchers can benefit the most from open access to research.  Our platform must be useable for them too.<p>Future at Academia.edu<p>We have a fun and agile team and we are growing (our site usage grows 10% per month)!  We have the resources to make our mission come true.  We just raised $11 million from Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. We&#x27;re based in Downtown San Francisco.<p>Chat with Ashley<p>If you think you would be interested in solving some of these technical problems then please do not hesitate to contact ashley[at]academia.edu.","time":1396381440,"type":"comment"},{"deleted":true,"id":7510481,"parent":7507765,"time":1396376355,"type":"comment"},{"by":"Ovid","id":7509617,"kids":[7512124],"parent":7507765,"text":"Search scientist. Amsterdam. Relocation and Visa provided. And I mean <i>real</i> search scientist, not just someone who put together Solr that one time.<p>We have a client who has a fantastic position which has opened up. They’re searching for you because you’ll be searching for them: they need an expert search engine&#x2F;data mining specialist and very few people can fill this role.<p>You’ll have several years of experience with search engines and (preferably) e-commerce, a proven capability to mine data and a Master’s or Doctorate in Statistics, Math, AI, Computer Science or a comparable background. This isn’t for someone who’s just set up Elasticsearch, Solr, or some other search engine (though that helps). It’s for someone who can mine the data of customer searches and provably demonstrate they can create better search results for customers. You won’t be waiting for tasks to do: you’ll be deciding the tasks and how to do them.<p>How do you exclude a location 500 meters away from the one a customer is searching for but it’s across an international boundary or a river with no bridge? How do you do that in a performant manner? Or maybe searches in different languages should be treated differently based on cultural preferences? And do different categories of customers have different search needs? How would they be categorized and how would different search results impact them? Or maybe you can demonstrate that the above wouldn’t impact sales and you have a better solution?<p>The possibilities are endless and the position itself is very high level within the company. They’re offering a generous salary, an awesome work&#x2F;life balance, a generous vacation package and a catch: you have to let them pay to relocate your household (even rats, if you want to) to the heart of Amsterdam, one of the most beautiful cities in the world. If you’re going to be sitting down sketching out how to group customers using adaptive resonance theory, wouldn’t it be lovely to do that while sipping a Grolsh, eating bitterballen, next to a beautiful Dutch canal?<p>And with 26 days of vacation and 9 public holidays, you’ll have seven weeks off a year to enjoy. Take a relaxing two-week road trip across Europe and return to work with several weeks of holiday left.<p>Given the extremely high level of expertise needed for this role, our client realizes that the few people who are both capable and willing to accept this role will need a relocation package. And if you have a family, our client will take care of them, too. Have special relocation requirements? As long as you are willing to work in Amsterdam, bring them up and the company will see what they can do. On top of that, you’ll probably qualify for something called the 30% ruling. This is a law passed by the Dutch government to attract top experts like you. When you qualify, you’ll be taxed on only 70% of your salary. The other 30% will be handed to you tax-free, effectively giving you a huge pay rise on top of an already generous salary.<p>This is a high level position in the company and you’ll be given a lot of autonomy to make things happen. Further, the success criteria for the job are extremely clear and you’ll be given all the tools you need to directly measure your success. The exact nature of the role can potentially be tailored to meet your personal preferences.<p>The work environment is laid-back, English is the working language, and you’ll be working with other expats with a sense of adventure. Amsterdam is a friendly, low-crime city and almost everyone speaks English fluently, but if you want Dutch lessons, our client will help. Heck, if you have other requirements, bring them and get them on the table. For the right candidate, everything’s open to discussion.<p>If this sounds interesting and you want more information, contact us at jobs@allaroundtheworld.fr.","time":1396370646,"type":"comment"},{"by":"stuartleigh","id":7514039,"parent":7507765,"text":"onefinestay | London, UK - Full Time<p># who are we?<p>There’s a new way to stay in a city. onefinestay is a trusted service for hosts to flexibly share their homes while they’re out of town.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that.
