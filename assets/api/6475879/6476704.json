We do clinical genomic variant analysis. We take exome sequence data and predict clinical outcome for the variants we observe in patients, which is then used by clinicians to inform diagnosis. To do this, we aggregate large amounts of additional data on individual genes and variants, and apply a series of proprietary algorithms.<p>We&#x27;re growing our software engineering team. At Codified your responsibilities will be wide - you will probably end up touching every piece of software we write, with an emphasis on the user facing applications. We are currently using GWT and MySQL with some scripting in Python. Successful candidates will be productive with Java and comfortable working in a Linux environment.<p>We have a large number of interesting projects under active development, spanning natural language processing, machine learning, user interface design and of course sequence analysis.<p>A willingness to learn is more important to us than a Biology background, but the job will require you to learn the basics of the Biology that we&#x27;re working with.<p>Preference will be shown to candidates in the Houston area.<p>Send resumes to codifiedgenomics@gmail.com","time":1380640628,"type":"comment"}
