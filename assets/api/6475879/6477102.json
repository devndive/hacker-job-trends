San Francisco | Full Stack &amp; Web Developers<p>We&#x27;ve invented the Counsyl Test, a breakthrough diagnostic intended for parents planning to start a family. The test won the Wall Street Journal Innovation Award for Medicine, was named one of Scientific American&#x27;s &quot;Top 10 World Changing Ideas,&quot; and was featured in the New York Times. Our test is now prescribed by physicians for more than 2.5% of all births in the United States.<p>The cost of sequencing human genomes is plunging - over 5x faster than the cost of computing; the potential impact on preventive healthcare and the medical landscape is boundless. The science is there but the scale isn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s where Counsyl comes in. We are building the technology platform to make genomics useful and accessible to everyone.\nThe vast majority of our operations are powered by our own custom-built infrastructure on a Python&#x2F;Django&#x2F;Postgres stack, from ordering to lab processing to billing. Weâ€™re building new tools, new workflows, and new infrastructure to solve the challenging problems of a technology startup involved with not just bits, but also interconnected physical components like lab robotics and patient samples.<p>email resume to kyle.barbato@counsyl.com","time":1380644185,"type":"comment"}
