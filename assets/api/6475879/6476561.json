Our clients come from heavy industry -- civil engineering, construction, shipping, manufacturing, etc. -- where information technology stagnated a decade ago. This is our opportunity. We&#x27;ve built a business around providing modern, user-centric web and mobile applications to replace their aging and clunky desktop programs. Enterprise doesn&#x27;t have to suck.<p>Being a small company, you&#x27;ll be given a lot of autonomy and chances to learn. At a large firm, you may spend a decade contributing your small piece to a vast legacy sourcebase. We start 6 new projects a year. Iterate rapidly and improve your skills.<p>Inquiries can be sent to me -- adam@concretedata.com","time":1380639214,"type":"comment"}
