We&#x27;re a small, fun team dedicated to revolutionizing the investment management industry.<p>You should have some degree of full-stack experience, but the majority of our application work is front-end-ish, focusing on JavaScript -- in particular jQuery, D3, and Angular.js. Bootstrap and LESS experience is also nice.<p>Have an eye for design? We care a lot about UI&#x2F;UX, so artistic types with coding experience are welcome to apply as well.<p>All levels of experience are welcome to apply, but we&#x27;d prefer a more junior level coder who wants to learn and grow with us. We have a very flat organization, which means you&#x27;ll be working directly with the CTO and founding team.<p>Please send a detailed resume, with links to past work&#x2F;code snippets if possible, to info@quovo.com.","time":1380634989,"type":"comment"}
