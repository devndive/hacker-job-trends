Our product lets teams offer unique experiential upgrades and also unused or unsold seats as in venue upgrades. It&#x27;s better for fans, better for teams, and both love our current product. We are a well-funded and passionate startup, looking for a few devs to help us grow and change the industry.<p>Some technologies we use: Groovy&#x2F;Grails, PostgreSql, redis, BackboneJS, etc. Experience with any of these is not required. We believe a good dev can pick up tools as necessary. We move fast, and we love new challenges and finding the right solution for them.<p>Contact me directly at: matt [at] expapp.com","time":1380662237,"type":"comment"}
