We do that by helping everyone connect the web applications they already use.<p>We believe that there are jobs that a computer is best at doing and that there are jobs that a human is best at doing. We want to empower businesses everywhere to create processes and systems that let computers do what they are best at doing and let humans do what they are best at doing.<p>We believe that with the right tools, you can have 10X the impact with less work.<p>We believe in small teams. Small teams are fast and nimble. Small teams mean less bureaucracy and less management and more getting things done.<p>We believe that credentials are not needed. Our head of development has a finance degree. Our head of business and marketing has an engineering degree. Our head of design has a mechanical engineering degree. What you love doing is way more important than the credentials you have.","time":1380644057,"type":"comment"}
