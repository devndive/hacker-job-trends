But advertising keeps the web free (as in beer), and we want to keep the internet free. So rather than hating on advertising, we decided to do something about it.<p>At SocialWire, we are taking a new approach to advertising: building a recommendation engine for ads. Our system generates product-level ads and hyper-targets them to exactly the right audience. We do this at scale and automatically across a retailer&#x27;s entire catalog. We want our ads to be so good that people discover interesting products through them, and find them to actually be useful.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a full-stack engineer to join our small and talented team. As our fifth engineer, you&#x27;ll have the opportunity to work on and shape all aspects of our product, from backend Python services to slick dashboard features in JavaScript. We work at the intersection of distributed machine learning and data warehousing, we like to experiment and take risks, and our engineers choose what they build. Most features are live in production just hours after they&#x27;re completed. We push early and often (with testing and code review!). We ask tough questions. We get shit done.<p>Super sharp team, early stage company, awesome investors, huge opportunity, beautiful office, and interesting engineering&#x2F;research challenges. Come join us!<p>If interested, drop me a line at stefan@socialwire.com","time":1380663163,"type":"comment"}
