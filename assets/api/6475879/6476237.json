[LOCAL | RELOCATE OK]<p>We&#x27;re a YC company wrangling SaaS to work together (as they should), starting by bringing the biggest apps our customers use right into Gmail. We&#x27;ve been growing our team over the past few months, and looking to add even more awesome people.\nWe work with dozens of API&#x27;s to show our users profiles of their customers without having to jump out of the email flow - imagine having <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtzqRSlgqkw\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=WtzqRSlgqkw</a> available when helping customers.<p>Thousands of people use it every day for hours on end, and are happy to pay for it to make sure they can continue using it. But there&#x27;s still so much polish and improvement possible.<p>We also spend time improving our tooling, and tools for other developers. As one example we&#x27;ve recently vastly improved the source-map capabilities of the ClojureScript compiler and added reified keywords to the runtime to make ClojureScript a better citizen on the web. We do it because we want to give back to the communities that have enabled us, because it helps us, and because it&#x27;s interesting.<p>Looking for an engineer who loves the craft, who cares about building product, and is excited about helping customers. We&#x27;re building a team that&#x27;s able to reduce complexity others balk at into simple, easy to reason about system, so we can continue to move quickly and delight both customers and ourselves.<p>This is both UI and backend work.<p>Languages: Clojure, Clojurescript, Javascript.\nsean @ zenboxapp\n<a href=\"https://www.zenboxapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zenboxapp.com</a>","time":1380636726,"type":"comment"}
