After surgery, patients often need to transition to a care facility to complete their recovery. Right now, deciding which facility to transition to involves a printed spreadsheet and lots of phone calls. We&#x27;re using technology to make that process faster and more pleasant for the patient and the hospital.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a person with an eye for design who can write clean, standards-compliant html and css that will look good in ie7+ (hospitals aren&#x27;t on the bleeding edge of browser tech). Javascript chops would be great, but aren&#x27;t required.<p>We are currently working out of the Paypal Start Tank in Boston.
