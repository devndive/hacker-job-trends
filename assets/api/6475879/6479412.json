We&#x27;ve just raised a new round to continue our scale (<a href=\"http://tcrn.ch/1dSbFH4\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tcrn.ch&#x2F;1dSbFH4</a>), which will accelerate even more as we&#x27;re being shipped in both the xbox one and PS4 this Christmas.<p>We&#x27;re looking for smart and passionate engineers to help us get there. We&#x27;re in the process of incrementally rebuilding our architecture to support the near 50 million MAU we have on our site for hours each and every day. We&#x27;re using Go (we&#x27;ve found some interesting bugs because of our scale) for large chunks of our new infrastructure. We&#x27;re incredibly API driven - if you understand the concept of data gravity, you&#x27;re the right kind of person. If you love creating high quality products, you&#x27;re the right kind of person.<p>If you want to know more, email me at ossareh@twitch.tv (Director of Engineering, fwiw!)","time":1380665841,"type":"comment"}
