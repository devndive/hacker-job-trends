We work on a wide range of interesting projects, most of which are directed towards identifying the causes of and curing diseases. The environment is awesome, the work is important and the group is amazing. As part of our work, we build infrastructure and tools to make future analyses of large scale biomedical omics data easier. That is where you will come in, we are looking for an experienced scientific programmer to join our group, working on scaling up existing analyses to handle the ever-expanding scale of genomics data. The work environment is very self-directed: we have a common focus and goals but nobody tells you what to do, we all care deeply about what we are working on and our group cohesion comes from that. If that sounds like a group dynamic you are interested in, and you are excited that the work you are doing might help make someone&#x27;s life better, we&#x27;d love to hear from you.<p>About 80% of the work is done in Python; the other 20% is distributed between Clojure and R.<p>Below is a link to the actual advertisement on the ISCB website along with the text of the advertisement.
