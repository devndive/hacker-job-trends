We also develop really great software to compliment our hearing devices – from software used in the production of hardware, to desktop software used by audiologists, and more recently mobile applications used directly by our patients. We never lose sight of the human side of our business - if you are interested in software development that improves the quality of life for others, look no further!<p>We are currently expanding our mobile applications team with positions at both the senior and junior levels. Our biggest need at the moment is build infrastructure – developing and supporting internal tooling that helps developers across several teams work more efficiently. We also have positions open across our full stack which involves a mix of languages and technologies such as modern C++ (C++14), Java, Swift, CMake and Gradle.<p>Email careers (at) unitron (dot) com for more info<p>See more postings: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;live.solique.ch&#x2F;microsites&#x2F;sonova&#x2F;microsite&#x2F;?brand=500&amp;lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;live.solique.ch&#x2F;microsites&#x2F;sonova&#x2F;microsite&#x2F;?brand=50...</a>","time":1475600307,"type":"comment"}
