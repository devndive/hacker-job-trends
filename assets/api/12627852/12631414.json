I&#x27;m not good at marketing, you can Google us &amp; read for yourself. I&#x27;ve been here &gt;3 years and love it - common feeling here, the high retention rate and happy team speaks for itself. Happy customers, too. The customer conference is a lot of fun.<p>We&#x27;re hiring pretty much every engineering specialty, still growing fast - my team specifically is looking for web client expertise, but if that&#x27;s not your thing I can connect you with someone who knows your specialty better. Web client stack is the usual SPA ecosystem: Angular, React, Node, TypeScript. Happy to go deeper if you&#x27;re interested.
