I joined about a year ago after parting ways with a $3M VC-backed startup I cofounded 5 years ago. A lot of startups have great teams and investors but I chose this startup because I believe that it&#x27;s in the right space at the right time: transportation.<p>Transportation is roughly 9% of US GDP. Looking at the next 10 years of transportation, it&#x27;s autonomous, electric, shared and connected. Smartcar is building the connected part.<p>The past 3 months have been a whirlwind. We&#x27;ve brought on big deals with Fortune 500 companies and hired on 3 engineers... but we need mid-level engineering more help immediately.<p>If you want to learn more, email me at Martin@Smartcar.com or call me at 415 404 5650.<p>Our stack is Node.js, Postgres, Redis, Docker, AWS. Interview process is a phone call, take-home project and then a 2-3 hour on-site interview with all staff.<p>$95K to $130K + up to 1.0% equity\nNo recruiters. No remote.","time":1475509501,"type":"comment"}
