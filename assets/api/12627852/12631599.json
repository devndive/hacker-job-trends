Ravel enables lawyers to find, contextualize, and interpret information that turns legal data into legal insights. Ravel&#x27;s array of powerful tools – which include data-driven, interactive visualizations and analytics – transforms how lawyers understand the law and prepare for litigation. In today&#x27;s global and increasingly digital world, Ravel empowers attorneys to benefit from this huge influx of information and find value in it.<p>In 2012, Ravel spun out of Stanford University&#x27;s Law School, Computer Science Department, and d.school, with the support of CodeX (Stanford&#x27;s Center for Legal Informatics).<p>We&#x27;re looking for an experienced front-end engineer. We build our front-end in Ember using Ember-CLI, ES6 transpilers, ember-data, and http-mocks for rapid and modern development. Ideal candidates will be skilled in highly dynamic web interface development (HTML, JavaScript, AJAX, jQuery). In addition, candidates should have a passion for engineering unique interactive visualizations with d3.js and potentially canvas&#x2F;webGL. A flexible front-end engineer with 3-5 years JavaScript experience will excel in this role, but 2+ years professional Ember experience will also distinguish leading candidates.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;ravel&#x2F;73e5b4a3-7732-4369-8b3a-d82c934f97c2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;ravel&#x2F;73e5b4a3-7732-4369-8b3a-d82c934f...</a>","time":1475531105,"type":"comment"}
