We believe we’re on to something big, but to get there we’re working through end-to-end complex problems in a complex and old-fashioned domain. We’re taking an unconventional approach (event sourcing with a twist and a touch of farmville) and dealing with big data to boot.<p>Because of this complexity, we&#x27;re limiting our search to two kinds of people: experienced engineers who can bring structure to the chaos as we grow, or those applicants who can make up for lack of experience with passion and creativity. Please don&#x27;t apply unless you can demonstrate one of these somehow.<p><i>Back-end stack:</i> Migrating from C# to Scala.
