For that purpose, we&#x27;re hiring in two teams right now working on computational initiatives to use data to optimize the scientific process.  One team is more focused on data management, the other more on metabolic modeling.<p>Our stack is Python on the backend (SQLAlchemy, REST&#x2F;gRPC, scientific Python packages) and AngularJS on the front-end (1.x right now moving soon to 2.x) deployed using Docker.<p>We are located at the campus of the Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby, just outside central Copenhagen. Salary is on a government pay grade, as negotiated with a union. (Expect a fair salary — not quite as much much as you can find in industry, but with good conditions and benefits).<p>For the two positions, visit to our jobs site:<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biosustain.dtu.dk&#x2F;english&#x2F;about&#x2F;vacant-positions\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biosustain.dtu.dk&#x2F;english&#x2F;about&#x2F;vacant-positions</a><p>You can also write me an email at lays@biosustain.dtu.dk","time":1475535308,"type":"comment"}
