We&#x27;re a driven, curious group wielding data science and building software that meaningfully impacts humans. Our mission is bold, our team is experienced, and our product is ambitious. We&#x27;re looking for builders to help us bring it to life.<p>We love individuals who are curious about domains outside of the ones we normally operate in, enjoy polyglot codebases, consider themselves a generalist, and desire to work on products that make a positive impact. The bar for software in this field is, unfortunately, low. We want to change that in a massive way.<p>* Full Stack Engineer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;blackfynn&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;163111-full-stack-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;blackfynn&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;163111-full-stack-engineer</a><p>* Frontend Engineer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;blackfynn&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;163112-front-end-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;blackfynn&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;163112-front-end-engineer</a><p>We&#x27;re well funded and have excellent traction on a number of significant partnerships.
