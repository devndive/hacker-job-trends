We believe automation is key and seek to automate the everyday tasks for ticket brokers to save them time, avoid errors, and reduce financial losses. To do this, we&#x27;ve created a core stack made up of Elixir, Phoenix, and React to get our data as quickly as we can to users in real-time.<p>We are currently hiring for a strong front-end developer, ideally with React Native experience for our next-gen product. We already use React and Redux heavily in our front-end stack, but our next phase needs a strong front-end &amp; mobile developer to bring everything together. Also, any GraphQL experience and interest in functional programming would be a huge bonus as well.<p>We are also a 100% remote team, so you can join us from anywhere.
