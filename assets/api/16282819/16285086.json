We help tech savvy buyers shop for homes with expert online support, then save them a ton of money with a 50% commission refund. We&#x27;re assisting hundreds of thousands of active buyers and transacting more than one home each day.<p>Our stack is rails, react, and mongodb with a heavy peppering of AWS goodies. The only tool we’re dogmatic about is simplicity. You should be comfortable developing the full critical path of a new web feature, but we’re most excited about front end web and&#x2F;or native app expertise.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openlistings.workable.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openlistings.workable.com&#x2F;</a>","time":1517513760,"type":"comment"}
