Projects are very different in scope and subject - currently one team is migrating a catalog with 10M unique products to a new platform and UI (this is me!), while another recently completed work on an oil trading platform with obscene volumes.<p>I&#x27;m a frontend dev, so implementing the UI is my bread and butter. Roles aren&#x27;t strictly defined though, and I myself am involved in improving our dev tools (Docker setup, Bamboo for CI etc), while others maintain our amazing internal UI library Scylla, for example.<p>We&#x27;re stretched thin especially on senior frontend devs, so if you&#x27;ve got a couple of years under your belt working on UI implementations, and an understanding of modern web development, please do apply! <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lamia.fi&#x2F;en&#x2F;career&#x2F;senior-frontend-developer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lamia.fi&#x2F;en&#x2F;career&#x2F;senior-frontend-developer</a><p>Reach out to careers@lamia.fi for any questions.","time":1517503073,"type":"comment"}
