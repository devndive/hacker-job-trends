Our team is based in San Francisco and we are well-funded by top investors in the space.<p>Cryptocurrency is a domain where correctness really counts. As such, we focus on building reliable software through the use of statically-typed functional programming languages. This is reflected in our OCaml codebase and style of structuring code around DSLs, as well as in the design of the smart-contracts platform we&#x27;re developing.<p>There is no need to have prior experience in cryptography, and we&#x27;re hiring engineers to work on a bunch of exciting projects including:<p>* Our OCaml DSL for writing zk-SNARKs (a cryptographic primitive for certified computation).<p>* The design of a virtual machine and higher-level languages for smart contracts (there a lot of interesting challenges here since the VM has to be efficient inside SNARKs).<p>* Working on the core networking, cryptography, and reliability aspects of the protocol.<p>This is a chance to join a small, collaborative team and have a ton of independence while working on fascinating cross-disciplinary problems in computing. We also offer competitive compensation both in salary and equity as well as top-of-the-market benefits.<p>Please get in touch by sending an email with your resume and the subject &quot;Engineer applicant&quot; to jobs@o1labs.org (I&#x27;m the CTO and will read&#x2F;respond personally.)","time":1517513278,"type":"comment"}
