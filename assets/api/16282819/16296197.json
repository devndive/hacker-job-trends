We work primarily in the open, with standards bodies and the Node community, to help make JavaScript and the web better for developers everywhere.<p>We are looking for somebody with C++ performance engineering expertise to come join us on our mission to make JavaScript fast with Chakra on these platforms. You must be eligible to work in the US, have 5+ years of experience writing high-performance C++ code, have some background writing JavaScript (either for the web or Node), have expertise in low-level performance tooling and investigations and be interested in participating in technical discussions in the open with both internal partners and external communities. Compiler&#x2F;Runtime experience is a plus, as is experience with API design. You will be required to pass Microsoft background checks prior to the start of employment and periodically thereafter. Further details regarding this process will be provided in follow up correspondence.<p>This is a unique opportunity to do work helping millions of users around the world, and to participate in open communities to shape the future of JavaScript. If you think that geeking out about language design, squeezing out that last bit of performance by hand-tuning assembly instructions, closely analyzing perf traces or working on the next generation developer tools, sounds like fun, send us a short intro + resume to chakracore (at) microsoft (dot) com.","time":1517632480,"type":"comment"}
