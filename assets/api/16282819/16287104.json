If you&#x27;ve seen a commercial where someone takes out an app after a car accident, they&#x27;re probably one of our clients. The company is currently in a strong growth phase and just moved to a new larger office, with a focus on controlled rather than hyper growth. Many of our clients are fortune 500 companies, but we&#x27;re still relatively small with around 300 employees, about half of which work remotely. We&#x27;re the industry leader in self-service\nclaims.<p>Our core stack is React+Rails hosted on AWS&#x2F;Heroku, but there&#x27;s plenty of other smaller projects in other languages and stacks and of course our Android and iPhone apps. Our primary product is an internal CRM, but as mentioned it&#x27;s supported by other more focused ones such as tools for body shops or car rental services.<p>One of the things I think worth highlighting is bi-weekly hack days, which actually produce things we deploy to production or use as a foundation for other projects rather than sitting on\na local branch gathering dust. We&#x27;re hiring for just about any role or background, including data science and design.<p>Check out our information&#x2F;marketing page at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snapsheetapp.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snapsheetapp.com&#x2F;careers</a> and available positions at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.snapsheetapp.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.snapsheetapp.com&#x2F;</a>.","time":1517529500,"type":"comment"}
