The goal with this position is to help generate early traction, which means it will start with a bit of creative marketing efforts, likely continue with some sales, and end with some Customer Success (contingent upon success of the first two areas, of course). We are looking for someone to help out across the board, so you should be a generalist and a bit of a hustler.<p>Vitally is a product analytics platform (with revenue analytics coming soon) to drive success for B2B startups - think Mixpanel meets Baremetrics with a focus exclusively on B2B needs&#x2F;pains. We did the Techstars NYC accelerator last fall and will launch our first official offering in April.<p>If you want to join a promising startup in its (very) early stages, please reach out to jamie@vitally.io. Thanks!","time":1517501717,"type":"comment"}
