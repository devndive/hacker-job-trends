If you&#x27;ve enjoyed Cryptopals then this could be the place for you);\n- Full stack &#x2F; back end developers who can deliver a shiny UX as well as in-depth server-side functionality;\n- Networking and Operations folks to install stuff with interesting customers and help them when things go wrong (including deft handling of PEBKAC issues).<p>We look for people who can work autonomously, deliver ahead of schedule, and not hum annoyingly when listening to music on their headphones while working. You need to be dynamic, adaptable, experienced, with a strong existing knowledge of networking, VoIP, SIP and stuff like that... or at least be really dynamic and fast-learning.<p>Armour is a 20-person company, offering share options, bonuses, and an unhealthy dependency on chocolate biscuits and doughnuts. We’re also very British, which is why we spell doughnuts the correct way.<p>Interested?
