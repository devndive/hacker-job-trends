We value the principles of Software Craftsmanship and have a shared passion for continuous learning.<p>Our Software Craftspeople have a broad appreciation of technology and a depth of expertise in key areas. These will include expertise in the JVM, .Net or Node.js stacks, plus expertise in areas such as XP, cloud technology, building a DevOps culture or perhaps Cyber Security. We believe however that technology can be taught. Itâ€™s more important that our Craftspeople, regardless of existing expertise and experience, share the same passion for continuous learning and clean code principles that we do.<p>Our Apprentices share our passion for creating well-crafted software but have not yet had the suitable learning opportunities to refine their craft. A typical Apprentice is already a productive developer in the language of their choice on the JVM, .NET, and&#x2F;or Node JS platforms at the start of the programme. They will know of Agile processes and practices and can apply them and are looking to become an expert in reasoning about them. They will have basic knowledge of micro level and macro level design.<p>For more information, please visit <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codurance.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codurance.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a>","time":1517524925,"type":"comment"}
