Out of this passion, we&#x27;ve developed the worldâ€™s first wearable power meter for runners that provides insight into their running technique and performance.<p>We are looking for an Android developer who is also an endurance runner, or a triathlete, or at least to have the passion about running and is actively training with a goal in mind.<p>Good sense of design is bonus. Current the whole Android code base we have is in Java, but we are open to transit to Kotlin gradually if it boosts the productivity.<p>Being able to relocate to Boulder is required. BTW, if you like running, Boulder is pretty much your dream place. You get tons of opportunities to run and train with LOTS of elite athletes who are Stryd ambassadors here.<p>Salary &amp; equity depends on experience.<p>If interested, please send an email to kun@stryd.com","time":1517513354,"type":"comment"}
