We&#x27;re the biggest rehearsal studio provider in the UK and rapidly expanding abroad. We build our own studios that are open 24&#x2F;7, and all booking is handled online.<p>We&#x27;re looking to expand our dev team right now. Being excited about music is definitely a bonus, but we have loads of fun and exciting programming projects in the pipeline. Ideas are welcome and many of our improvements come from people in the business suggesting them.<p>Our projects are primarily in Ruby and JavaScript, though we also develop IoT applications in languages like Rust and Haskell. We work in small project-based teams on our various components, and we have dedicated (and good!) project managers who help give us plenty of time and space to focus on programming.<p>Ideally we&#x27;re looking for people in Bristol, where we&#x27;re soon opening a new office. Many of the dev team work remotely, but the majority of us are within easy distance of Bristol (or London) and we meet up regularly to discuss&#x2F;work&#x2F;beer together.<p>I&#x27;m Head of Development, and working for Pirate Studios is the best job I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ll go out of my way to make sure you get to build great things :)<p>Email us at tech-jobs@piratestudios.co.uk","time":1517507829,"type":"comment"}
