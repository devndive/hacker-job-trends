We&#x27;re the sort of company that does actually give a fuck about inequality, that experiments with things like open salaries, and believes revenue is the best indicator of traction. We&#x27;ve just raised a series A round, have our embarrassing MVP in the app store, and are looking to build out an engineering team to take the load off the founders.<p>This early in the process we&#x27;re all about culture, so we&#x27;re looking for locals who can work mostly from the office, but if you think you can persuade us it&#x27;s worth going a different way, we&#x27;re open to the conversation.<p>We have three immediate needs, in native iOS, backend (Rails), and product design.
