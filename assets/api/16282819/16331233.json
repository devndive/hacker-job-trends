We do this through a REST&#x2F;JSON API, a well thought-out architecture and intricate knowledge of the payment systems that govern all of our life. We are growing fast and are executing a huge opportunity for the company with a number of big name customers now in the pipeline.<p>We have a very diverse team (over 20 nationalities) consisting of 50+ people.<p>I (the person posting this) have just recently taken on the\nresponsibility of CTO and was positively surprised by the culture I already found in the existing team. I am now continuing to foster it. optile is firmly based on mutual respect, hiring smart people and getting out of their way (aka taking responsibility), honest feedback and transparency. Work here is challenging, but also fun and I personally focus on creating a team of happy humans who build great software. We pay competitive wages and have a good track record of providing incentives through equity for all employees. There are free soft drinks, beer, coffee and fruit.<p>We do have remote positions available in building payment method adapters, as the adapter team is the one that has most experience and the cultural tenets to work remotely, but the core team and the company is still local to Munich. One thing can lead to another, though.<p>That said, we are looking for:\n- Java developers of all kinds (junior, senior, you name it). The adapter developer position mentioned above needs more of a &quot;senior&quot; profile.\n- ReactJS&#x2F;Redux&#x2F;ReactNative developers (junior, senior, you name it)\n- Internal IT Administrator (preferably a generalist with an interest in everything and experience in structuring heterogeneous systems and herding cats)\n- Quality Assurance Lead (big focus on automation, but also taking a holistic view of the end-to-end product experience)<p>We are also looking for candidates in &quot;not typically HackerNews&quot; positions. We have openings for working students and in marketing and sales.<p>Experience with MongoDB, Spring, PostgreSQL, Lodash, D3.js, Vertx, perhaps a little bit of OSGi (yeah, we know, we&#x27;re moving away from it), a good understanding of cryptography, previous payment experience, risk models and machine learning are all a plus.<p>If anything of the above sounds good to you, please click the above link and send us your CV :).","time":1518084384,"type":"comment"}
