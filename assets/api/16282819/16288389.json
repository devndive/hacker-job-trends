We use Github for all feature planning and PR&#x27;s.<p>We are looking for a strong fullstack mid&#x2F;senior dev who can lead the project and implement boring solutions for interesting problems.<p>This is a great opportunity for someone who loves helping people and building out a meaningful and engaging product from the backend to the frontend.
