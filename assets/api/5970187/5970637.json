In the past two months, I&#x27;ve worked with Objective-C,\n    Javascript (Backbone+PhoneGap), and a little bit of Java and C#.\n  \n  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,\n    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and &gt; 40 hour weeks are\n    rare by design.\n\n  - We&#x27;re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.\n  \n  - We offer competitive salaries, health&#x2F;vision&#x2F;dental insurance, 401(k) + match, \n    quarterly profit sharing, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office with\n    snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about Grand Rapids:<p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago, 2.5 hours from Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.\n  \n  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in\n    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a “World Class” bar on BA. \n    Just look here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;beeradvocate.com&#x2F;beerfly&#x2F;city&#x2F;43\n  \n  - Affordable housing. If you’re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the \n    Bay Area or NYC, you can afford a house here (or a much nicer rental). I bought \n    a nice house with a mortgage payment drastically lower than the rent of my \n    1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.\n  \n  - A growing economy driven by technology, healthcare, and a growing list of\n    startups. The energy here around the growth in technology and the support\n    for entrepreneurs is infectious.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love writing software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.\n\n  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not\n    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.\n  \n  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.\n  \n  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.\n</code></pre>\nIf you&#x27;re interested, send me your resume&#x2F;CV and a little bit about why you’re interested:<p>ej@mutuallyhuman.com","time":1372687114,"type":"comment"}
