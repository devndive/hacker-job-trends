Built from billions of inputs, the data is constantly updated by Factual’s real-time data stack.  We were recently named one of &quot;50 Disruptive Companies in 2013&quot; by MIT Technology Review (<a href=\"http://www2.technologyreview.com/tr50/2013/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.technologyreview.com&#x2F;tr50&#x2F;2013&#x2F;</a>). We have a terrific team that is still fairly small and an incredible CEO who was previously the co-founder of Applied Semantics (which was bought by Google and became AdSense). Factual has venture funding from Andreessen-Horowitz and our partners&#x2F;customers include Facebook, Yelp, Foursquare, Trulia, and Newsweek.<p>There are many challenging problems to work on at all layers of the stack: data cleaning and canonicalization, storage, deduping, serving, APIs, improving data using machine learning, etc. If you love data, Factual is the place to be.
