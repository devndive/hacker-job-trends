Over 250k small businesses around the country have joined Thumbtack, and we&#x27;re making real money from connecting buyers and sellers.<p>Thumbtack&#x27;s people are down-to-earth, practical, and intelligent. Everyday for lunch we all sit down to a meal cooked by our in-house chef. On Wednesday nights, we stay late for a hot dinner, some wine, guests, and great conversation. Sometimes we drink beer that we&#x27;ve been brewing in the back closet.<p>Thumbtack&#x27;s gotten some good press recently because Sequoia just invested. (Very exciting.)<p>Our tech stack is a combination of Python, PHP (think Facebook, not Wordpress), Mongo, Postgres, AngularJS&#x2F;Backbone.<p>Ping me (chris @) if you want to learn more, chat, etc. Happy to meet up for coffee if you&#x27;re in SF.<p>Cheers!<p><a href=\"http://www.thumbtack.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thumbtack.com&#x2F;jobs</a>","time":1372698502,"type":"comment"}
