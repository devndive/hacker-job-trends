Swift Software is a growing product-centered technology company seeking talented developers to join our product team in Frederick, MD. Our flagship product is JobTraQ, a task management and workflow system that offers vastly more flexibility and power than any other product in our market segment, and is significantly less expensive and easier to configure than big &quot;BPM&quot; suites like MetaStorm and Lombardi. These advantages are allowing us to disrupt both markets.<p>You will create new features in JobTraQ and enhance existing functionality. Youâ€™ll help us build advanced visual design and administration tools, augment the product&#x27;s business intelligence capabilities, improve performance and scalability, and use customer feedback to enhance all parts of the system.<p>Our team has an enjoyable and collaborative culture in a creative environment. We interact positively and openly and emphasize learning and professional development. These attributes have enabled us to produce an industry-leading product with a globally recognizable and satisfied client base. Our environment is relaxed and fun, we play everything from Total Annihilation to Alien Swarm at our game nights, and we equip everyone with new quad-core Thinkpads with SSDs and dual monitors. Our policies and benefits are family-friendly, with generous vacation time, good health insurance options, and flexible work schedules.<p>For more information about this position, see the link below.
