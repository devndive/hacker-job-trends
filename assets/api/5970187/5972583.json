The test won the Wall Street Journal Innovation Award for Medicine, was named one of Scientific American&#x27;s &quot;Top 10 World Changing Ideas,&quot; and was featured in the New York Times. Our test is now prescribed by physicians for more than 2.5% of all births in the United States.<p>Recent TechCrunch article: <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/23/counsyl\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;04&#x2F;23&#x2F;counsyl</a><p>Upcoming Tech Talk on 7&#x2F;18: <a href=\"http://genomicsbigdata.eventbrite.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;genomicsbigdata.eventbrite.com</a><p>We&#x27;re looking for people who are excited about solving the practical last mile problems needed to actually achieve a return on our society&#x27;s multibillion dollar investment in the Human Genome Project.<p><i>Hiring for Software Engineers</i> (<a href=\"https://www.counsyl.com/jobs/software-engineer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.counsyl.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;software-engineer&#x2F;</a>)<p>You should have a BS, MS, or PhD in Computer Science (or equivalent) and significant independent programming experience as demonstrated by Github account, personal web page, or prior employment.<p>You should also be a generalist, interested in rotating through the engineering team and working in one or more of these areas:<p>- Genomics: design, validate, and optimize clinical genomic assays for rare Mendelian variants<p>- Machine Learning and Data Science: extract meaning out of one of the largest clinical genomic datasets in the world<p>- Robotics: automate and scale our backend to do more clinical sequencing and genotyping than anyone has ever done before<p>- UI&#x2F;UX: design the first widely adopted user interface for the medical genome<p>- Clinical Integration: solve the wide variety of practical issues associated with translating genomics into a clinical context<p>- Infrastructure: build and deploy the hardware and software systems that support secure, large-scale computations on genomic datasets<p>From a skills perspective, you should have familiarity with several of the following technologies.
