In Brief:<p>What would you do if you had over 457,000,000 facts about workers around the world–how they are paid, where they work, their commute times, benefits, years of experience, gender, job satisfaction and more? How would you collect, organize, display and mine such a large database? These are some of the challenges we face at online compensation company PayScale, where we have the world’s largest online database of detailed compensation data mined continuously with real-time analytics.<p>See positions for more info about our stack&#x2F;technologies but really we are just looking for great developers, also definitely open-minded about incorporating new things. Great problems to solve, people, and work-life balance.<p>If you are interested apply online or just send me an email, joec@paycale.com.","time":1372727513,"type":"comment"}
