To count as Senior, you should probably understand Moose, know how to use Test::More without needing to look anything up, and a CPAN ID would be an advantage. We&#x27;re paying up to Â£60,000, have a lovely light and airey office, and by virtue of being a small company owned by a huge company, we combine being financially secure with being lots of fun! That said, we&#x27;re not a startup. Job ad: <a href=\"http://jobs.perl.org/job/17563\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.perl.org&#x2F;job&#x2F;17563</a>","time":1372689730,"type":"comment"}
