In a nutshell, the backup appliance is a physical (or virtual) appliance that takes block-level backups of Windows, Mac, and Linux machines turn them into raw disk images and stores them on a local ZFS-based disk array. In the case of a disaster, our customers can then restore these backups&#x2F;disk image instantly as KVM-based virtual machines, iSCSI targets, Samba shares, and many other formats. We also offer a virtual VMware&#x2F;Hyper-V-based appliance and integrate with their hypervisors. We write code in modern Symfony-based PHP (with some Python and C sprinkled in), but we strongly rely on our Ubuntu-based Linux stack. Our appliance has a web UI (much like a router), but the main magic happens in the backend services and processes. We do amazing and exciting things every day, such as detecting when a VM has booted successfully, injecting drivers into the Windows registry before boot, or generating vmdk files on the fly. [More about the job on the website (see below)].<p>Responsibilities: You’ll work in one of our three Scrum teams, developing our SIRIS and Alto product. Each team consists of about five engineers. Work hours are usually around 9-5, though we&#x27;re pretty flexible with that. Working from home is also possible, although not encouraged.<p>Qualifications: We&#x27;re looking for a senior engineer with deep Linux know how -- ideally with knowledge in virtualization (VMware ESX, Hyper-V, libvirt, KVM&#x2F;QEMU), software defined networking and file systems (such as ZFS and Ceph).<p>Details see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datto.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;job-board&#x2F;post&#x2F;1524107\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datto.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;job-board&#x2F;post&#x2F;1524107</a><p>Email me (Phil) directly at phil @ datto . com or apply on the website.","time":1549222989,"type":"comment"},{"by":"j-collier","id":19060076,"parent":19055166,"text":"Realm Five, Inc. | Software Engineer, Firmware Engineer | Lincoln, NE | ONSITE | FULL-TIME |\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realmfive.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realmfive.com</a> Realm Five is developing disruptive solutions to automate production agriculture.

Nearly 90% of those transactions happen in a real-world store. Data is king and online it powers personalized customer experiences and product recommendations. Offline, however, it’s still 1999. Brands are blind to their customers, causing them to spend more and more money on “megaphone” marketing with the same message to everyone. The result is an ever-increasing wave of generic spam that makes it hard for consumers to build deeper, data-driven relationships with their favorite brands. No wonder brick-and-mortar stores are being left behind.\nIn a nutshell, Thanx ingests data, provides insights, enables actions to drive growth in the business. As a platform, Thanx is a horizontally-scalable, reliable, high-throughput, low-latency system.\nThink of us as Salesforce meets Google Adwords for offline retail. Thanx is backed by some of the best investors in the world — Sequoia Capital, Icon Ventures, and Andy Rachleff (CEO Wealthfront, cofounder Benchmark Capital), to name a few.<p>Thanx Engineering\nYes, we have an app you can download. But that represents no more than 5% of our codebase. The power of Thanx is massively scalable data pipelines, microservices that power four 9s uptime, intelligent purchase normalization, and matching algorithms  — we don’t show that stuff off publicly.<p>Here’s more on who we are:\n • Team: early engineers at AWS, Cloudera, Climate, Zenefits, Okta. Experience from startups and successful product companies like Google, Facebook, Intuit, Disney. This is an elite Eng team, period.\n • Growth: 10x YOY data growth; $100M+ delivered to merchants; 200% team growth; modern, rapidly-evolving platform.\n • Tech: scalable, reliable, high-throughput, low-latency backend systems; beautiful, performant, responsive UIs; user-friendly mobile apps.\n • Culture: data-driven decision-making, risk-taking, no hierarchy, collaboration &amp; shared responsibility, testing, and continuous improvement. As a remote-friendly team, we have flexible work hours. We work and play hard.

The Transit team is responsible for the infrastructure relating to the transit of data - this includes caching, messaging, queueing, and application routing (nginx). We&#x27;re slowly transitioning to be more of a &quot;tier one&quot; team, which means that we&#x27;ll be responsible for those systems and more - service discovery, site performance, and more.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone to help us maintain these systems and, possibly more importantly, determine the right path for an AWS migration. One of my favorite parts of this job is that we get to work incredibly closely with engineering teams to help them choose the right tools for the job, and then help them implement their use cases around those tools. Our ideal applicant doesn&#x27;t necessarily have experience with any of these tools, but they do have general ops and&#x2F;or application engineering experience and are willing and excited to learn the other side. Ideally you&#x27;re also excited to mentor - a big component of this job is working with engineering teams and helping them build with the infrastructure in mind.<p>I find the best way to explain our team is to share some of the problems we&#x27;ve been working on:<p># Redis Performance\nFor legacy reasons, we&#x27;re running multiple instances of redis on a single VM. They&#x27;ve recently started clobbering each other in competition for disk i&#x2F;o. We&#x27;ve been working on various projects to migrate to new hardware, split the multiple instances to different VMs, and reduce or remove the usage of redis entirely.<p># Site Routing\nAs we move more services to AWS, we&#x27;ve had some complications with how we route web requests. How can we ensure the same routing expectations are met in AWS as they are in our on-prem datacenter without massively increasing our operational burden, and having multiple different systems performing the same task in different datacenters?<p># Network Traffic Reduction\nOr, as we&#x27;ve taken to calling it, &quot;the service call diet&quot;. This is primarily manifesting as a change in how we make use of our caching systems (other than redis). Some of our services make hundreds of calls to memcache for a single request. This means that any sort of network latency can be magnified 100x over. We&#x27;ve been working with engineering teams to provide caching best practices and to build out a new internal caching library to simplify and abstract our caching infrastructure.<p>If this sounds like something you&#x27;d be interested in, please email me at tylerl@surveymonkey.com.

Synthetic Minds will allow you to leverage your technical chops.<p>Synthetic Minds is building program synthesizers, i.e., automation that can write code. We have a system in production that reads&#x2F;writes smart contracts in Ethereum&#x27;s Solidity language, and we use it to ensure our customer&#x27;s code is secure and correct. Eventually, we plan on going far beyond smart contracts. Think of what we are building as a compiler that takes code and translates it to theorem proving, so that we can build automation that can understand code almost as close to a human. If it can understand code, with sufficient compute it can even “synthesize” it.<p>In Oct 2018, we raised a $5.6M seed round from Y Combinator, Khosla Ventures and Pantera Capital [6].

Making sure processes run reliably over many days. Ensure robustness of the infrastructure across node&#x2F;process&#x2F;memory&#x2F;algorithm failures.<p># Software engineer: Compilers&#x2F;verification&#x2F;synthesis — You’ll be working on developing new algorithms that analyze and generate code [2]. You’ll identify when an engineering solution is needed (i.e., throw across a cluster of machines), or when an algorithmic improvement is required. You might even play with the Z3 theorem prover [3]. And if you’re really into it, you can improve Z3.<p># Software engineer: Smart contracts — You’ll be working on the “front-end of the compiler”, which reads in smart contracts languages (e.g., Solidity) and makes it accessible to the backend (the part that does semantic analysis). Desire to work at the compiler level of smart contracts is required, e.g., see [4] — experience in writing smart contracts is easily acquired as a side effect.<p>Contact: saurabhs@synthetic-minds.com - Saurabh, Founder<p>[1] Synthetic Minds Jobs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;synthetic-minds.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;jobs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;synthetic-minds.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;jobs.html</a><p>[2] Program synthesis: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@vidiborskiy&#x2F;software-writes-software-program-synthesis-101-294a9a35177\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@vidiborskiy&#x2F;software-writes-software-pro...</a><p>[3] Z3 Theorem Prover: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Z3Prover&#x2F;z3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Z3Prover&#x2F;z3</a><p>[4] Solidity AST: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ethereum&#x2F;solidity&#x2F;blob&#x2F;develop&#x2F;libsolidity&#x2F;ast&#x2F;AST.cpp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ethereum&#x2F;solidity&#x2F;blob&#x2F;develop&#x2F;libsolidit...</a><p>[5] Solidity smart contracts: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;solidity.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;v0.4.21&#x2F;solidity-by-example.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;solidity.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;v0.4.21&#x2F;solidity-by-examp...</a><p>[6] Forbes funding article: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;darrynpollock&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;22&#x2F;investment-boost-for-synthetic-minds-helps-build-automated-smarter-smart-contracts&#x2F;#72f772f92a63\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;darrynpollock&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;22&#x2F;invest...</a>","time":1549065041,"type":"comment"},{"deleted":true,"id":19059829,"parent":19055166,"time":1549064123,"type":"comment"},{"by":"lbusby89","id":19058842,"parent":19055166,"text":"Iterable | San Francisco, CA | Full-Time, Onsite | <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iterable.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iterable.com</a><p>Iterable is the growth marketing platform that enables brands to create, execute and optimize campaigns to power world-class customer engagement across email, push, SMS, in-app and more with unparalleled data flexibility.

We have a high emphasis on continual learning. If you&#x27;re not learning something new on the job its time for a new one. Our tech stack reflects this; Haskell and Elm are the main languages. We don&#x27;t mind if its your first exposure to either. We&#x27;re not afraid of experimenting or making mistakes. The most important quality of anyone on our team is their ability to learn and teach. Our sales pipeline is miles ahead of our development and we&#x27;re looking to grow the team to deliver more feature our customers.

Customers have loved our demos and we&#x27;re understandably coy in our public descriptions.<p>This is for someone who:<p>* is comfortable in functional programming, especially Haskell &amp; Elm; and * is experienced shipping complex web software to production; and * has an eagerness to learn and willingness to share knowledge.<p>A Typical Day looks like:<p>* Start off writing a feature that requires elm-ports. These can be tricky, so you pair with another developer who has shipped such code before.<p>* After lunch you&#x27;re requested to review a Pull Request that fixes a bug you accidentally introduced a couple weeks back. There&#x27;s no blame, instead some discussion about how our tests and review process could have caught this earlier.<p>* The afternoon is spent with the Product guys around a whiteboard. You&#x27;re helping them sketch out architecture for a complex new data-auditing feature that we&#x27;ll need to deliver a couple of sprints down the line.<p>We&#x27;re far more interested in your capacity to learn then the arcana of specific tech tools, but our platform is largely composed of:<p><pre><code>  - Haskell\n  - Elm\n  - PostgreSQL\n  - Python &#x2F; scikit-learn\n  - AWS\n  - Automated Testing and CI&#x2F;CD.\n  \n</code></pre>\nContact us at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proda.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proda.ai</a> or check my profile","time":1549047572,"type":"comment"},{"by":"rtempleton","id":19056665,"parent":19055166,"text":"Igalia | Multiple positions | A Coruña, Spain | Full-Time | REMOTE | <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.igalia.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.igalia.com&#x2F;</a><p>Igalia is a worker-owned, employee-run company with over 15 years of experience building Free Software across a wide range of exciting fields.
