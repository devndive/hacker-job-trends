We also feel like the Web is in its infancy in terms of helping us to make better decisions based on data and that this space will explode in coming years.<p>We're planning to help with the detonation.<p>We have a long backlog of customers waiting to use our product when it launches (in Q1) and a big market in front of us. We're building an engineering-centric organization and working out of a cool work/live space in the Mission. Our current stack includes Ruby, Rails, MySQL, Resque, and elasticsearch, etc. We're also planning to contribute to open source as much as we can (e.g., <a href=\"https://github.com/rglabs/teleport\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/rglabs/teleport</a>).<p>We're funded but also really early so it's a unique opportunity to help us set the tone and to be a major contributor (not to mention, get a sizable option grant).<p>To hear more drop me a line directly at jon@rglabsinc.com or contact via our website. We'd love to share more with you.","time":1325563582,"type":"comment"}
