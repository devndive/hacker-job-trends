We're looking for clever devs who understand that the hardest part of building a business is defeating apathy, getting noticed, and connecting with people looking for your product or service. If you have any sort of subversive, counter-establishmentarian impulses, we'd like to talk to you. :)<p>Ping me at brad@nowspots.com if you want to chat.  We're a small team of just a few folks but count several fortune 500 companies as customers.  Come hack with us.","time":1325449615,"type":"comment"}
