Currently it's difficult for women to find the clothing they want online - it involves browsing many sites, it's unclear what to type into the search box, etc. We aim to make that process easy.<p>Currently we are 5 people on the tech side - myself (CTO), our CEO, a developer, and two designers, as well as 8 girls on the fashion side. Culturally we are pretty much a valley or NY startup - I'm a NY startup guy myself and I wouldn't work anyplace with big company culture.<p>We are looking for a junior programmer. There are a lot of things to do at styloot and we don't have time for all of them. We are looking for an entry level programmer to whom we can hand off the easy tasks. Web scraping is one of the biggies - we index a lot of sites and each site needs it's own scraper. Of course, if you can do more than just the easy tasks, that's even better.<p>If interested, send me an email. Contact info is in my profile. If you have code on github/bitbucket, you don't need to waste time writing a resume.","time":1325437095,"type":"comment"}
