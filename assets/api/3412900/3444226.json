What Kayak does for flights and hotels, Centzy does for the everyday services in your neighborhood like haircuts, dry cleaners, and oil changes. It's a large, untapped market, and we are funded by great investors who share our passion: Lightbank (Groupon's original investor), ff Venture Capital (Klout's original investor) and ER Accelerator.<p>We are two startup guys (one hacker, one business) and we are looking for another hacker to join us. As our first hire, we would consider you a late co-founder (<a href=\"http://startupboy.com/2011/12/13/why-you-cant-hire/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://startupboy.com/2011/12/13/why-you-cant-hire/</a>). We will compensate you as such (equity + salary) but also expect you to take significant product ownership and to help lead the development team. We're not picky about titles, but Lead Developer seems about right. You should be passionate about building great products and tackling big data and technology challenges. You should have deep experience in Ruby, Rails and Javascript. Experience with MongoDB is a plus.<p>We would prefer that you work with us in our sunny office in the Lower East Side of NYC. We share a co-working space with other startups so you'll get the benefit of being part of a larger community of fun and motivated entrepreneurs.<p>Please get in touch with your github profile, linkedin profile / resume, and a short description about an interesting project / product you built.<p>Feel free to get in touch with me directly and put \"Lead Developer (HN)\" in the subject line. jeremy at centzy dot com.","time":1326142862,"type":"comment"}
