We’re a venture backed company with a strong founding team from UC Berkeley (our founders grew out of the CS PhD program).<p>We’re looking for a full stack developer who wants to develop extremely reliable, clean, well-tested, and downright beautiful systems. We’ve found that a very productive and powerful way to do this is to write code that writes our code for us: <i></i>autogeneration<i></i> is the foundation of DotDashPay, and in this paradigm you can become a 100x engineer (building on top of our autogenerators will allow you to ship new features in hours instead of weeks).<p>On top of our autogeneration framework, we write most of our complex features in a combination of C, C++, and Go (golang). We are currently using Node.js as our web backend language and are migrating our frontend to React. Strong experience in at least a couple of these languages, and the desire to learn the others, is important to us.<p>Desirable characteristics:<p>* Polyglot programmer: we have APIs in almost every major language that are autogenerated from our specification. The APIs require small glue code that is written in the target language and needs to conform to the standards &#x2F; conventions of that language.<p>* Experience building&#x2F;managing infrastructure: as a small team, everyone helps build and manage our infrastructure. We use many modern tools and services (Docker, Ansible, AWS) and strive to build things the Right Way™, so we’re always open to trying a new ideas and tools.<p>* Security experience: our payment systems must support some of the biggest names in retail, and our codebase undergoes rigorous security testing and certifications. A strong understanding of security best practices helps ensure that our products ship faster and our customers can rely on our software.<p>* Experience &#x2F; interest in payments: payments is a surprisingly fascinating and complex iceberg. Even if you know very little now, a desire to learn more is important as it pervades most of what we do.<p>Please email Sean Arietta via sean (at) dotdashpay (dot) com to set up a time for an initial chat.","time":1462208044,"type":"comment"},{"by":"thomashusa","id":11614499,"parent":11611867,"text":"Senseware | Washington, DC | Full-time | On-site | Full-stack engineer<p>Senseware is an IOT startup, specializing in providing customers access to real-time sensor data through their modular sensor platform.

Our mobile applications are built with Xamarin, and our web app is built with React, but we don&#x27;t necessarily care if you&#x27;ve worked with either before as long as you&#x27;re a good programmer who&#x27;s interested in (and reasonably good at) learning new things.<p>A job at SiteDocs means:<p>* Being responsible for your own piece of the product.

For a remote employee, we&#x27;d want you to come on-site for the initial spin-up process.<p>For the Android and iOS teams, I know we&#x27;d love someone with 3d experience.  I don&#x27;t think those teams are very interested in a remote member.<p>The web services team writes mostly PHP and Haskell.  This is working on the backend supporting our mobile, web, and native clients.<p>Our hiring process usually involves a couple of casual phone screens, then a series of on-site interviews.<p>The company runs a chat service and a marketplace for users to make and sell 3d content to each other.  It&#x27;s a fairly relaxed, laid-back company.  I started working here in 2010, quit in 2013 to try working at Google, and came back here a year later when I decided that Google was far too stressful for me to be happy.<p>If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me.

We differentiate Cloak by (1) providing a beautiful minimal UI and features like auto-secure that allow the VPN to fade into the background, (2) actually caring about the secure construction of our apps, our APIs, and our VPN network, and (3) going the extra mile, and then another, for our customers.<p>Our ideal candidate has:<p>1. Deep experience architecting complex new Android applications, and an innate understanding of the pieces that need to be put together to provide an experience that matches our current iOS and OS X apps.<p>2. A keen sense of how they might build and interact with OpenVPN under the app&#x27;s hood, how they can implement auto-secure reliably, how they can gracefully handle captive portal networks, etc.<p>3. A curiosity about VPN networking, and an attention to detail to ensure that every security-critical decision the app needs to make -- from credential storage to networking configuration -- is made well.<p>4. Experience with modern Android development tools and practices: for example, our ideal candidate is probably running Studio beta 2.1 right now, is perhaps wary of using Fragments, already planned to start this app with appcompat, has played with or even used dagger2, retrofit and rxjava, butterknife, etc.<p>5. Ideally, a love of graceful UI designs, and a willingness to make pixel-detail changes or tweak animation curves when it just doesn&#x27;t feel right.<p>This is a meaty project and we think it will be a fun challenge for the right candidate.

For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud Foundry</i> solves application deployment and management.

We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform available.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is our suite of battled-hardened products, now open sourced. Greenplum tackles massive datasets with the comfort of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop.

It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after three and a half years, we’re moving data for a third of all K-12 students in America (20M kids), and 50,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of 110 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Node and React.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.  In particular, we’re looking for senior engineers and engineering managers: empathetic leaders who are excited about teaching, coaching and professional development.<p>We’ve also just launched a new product for schools: Clever Badges:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;badges\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;badges</a>\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.clever.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;04&#x2F;why-we-built-clever-badges&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.clever.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;04&#x2F;why-we-built-clever-badges&#x2F;</a><p>Clever Badges is a new way for students to log into their learning apps in a secure, personalized way without having to use the keyboard. It’s designed specifically for younger students who struggle to remember or type text-base passwords. Instead, these early-education students can verify their identity by simply holding their individual Clever Badges up to their login screen.<p>Check out the other stuff we’re doing at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs</a>, or check out some other recent press here:\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;ed&#x2F;2015&#x2F;08&#x2F;27&#x2F;434667722&#x2F;one-third-of-schools-are-using-this-app-youve-never-heard-of\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;ed&#x2F;2015&#x2F;08&#x2F;27&#x2F;434667722&#x2F;one-thir...</a>","time":1462219807,"type":"comment"},{"by":"bbabenko","id":11613822,"kids":[11665739],"parent":11611867,"text":"Orbital Insight (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orbitalinsight.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orbitalinsight.com</a>) | Palo Alto, CA | Full-time | ONSITE<p>Orbital Insight is a Geospatial Big Data company leveraging the rapidly growing availability of satellite, UAV, and other geospatial data sources.

To help meet this goal, the program will train qualified candidates to have immediate, meaningful impact as data scientists in some of the top data startups in the world. This program will hone their skills in statistics, machine-learning, programming, and product development by presenting them with real-world challenges put forth by startups in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area.<p>What We Offer: \nCatenus Science offers a fully-paid, 13-week apprenticeship during which we reinforce technical and business skills. We do this via a mix of formal instruction and hands-on application of data science in some of the best startups in the world.\nEvery startup is different, and each has its own unique culture and opportunities. That is why we want to give apprentices exposure to several places so they can find the right fit. Apprentices will have the opportunity to do rotations through three startups in a three month period while receiving training and mentorship the entire time. These startups will have well-scoped, immediately impactful data science problems for apprentices to solve.\nThe program is structured such that apprentices have four days a week of full-time employment at a startup and one day a week of instruction. Apprentices are expected to already be knowledgable in data science, so we view these instructions as a way to hone their skills. In addition, we will use this time for apprentices to present the problems they are working on to the group. This way they can teach about new insights and seek help when faced with obstacles.<p>Who We Are Looking For:\nWe are looking for candidates who posses technical virtuosity, communication skills, and business sense to use data in impactful ways.\nNecessary, but not sufficient, mathematical skills include a mastery of statistics and machine learning, and the ability to tell the difference between these two fields. Apprentices should have the hacking proficiency to code any idea regardless of programming language.\nNobody can understand those who cannot communicate. You should be able to clearly convey your thoughts, both in writing and orally. Communication does not end at expressing yourself, though. We expect apprentices who recognize the strengths of new ideas by listening to and understanding others.\nFinally, we have seen time and time again that the best data scientists are ruthlessly pragmatic. The ones creating state-of-the-art products understand the domain-problems they are solving and how to deliver those solutions efficiently. Apprentices should be able to formulate solutions to relevant business problems with data science tools. Furthermore, they should be able to identify new business opportunities by looking at data.<p>Learn more and apply:\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;catenus.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;catenus.com</a><p>Contact us:\nfrancisco@catenus.com","time":1462202831,"type":"comment"},{"by":"irishgeoff","dead":true,"id":11614127,"parent":11611867,"text":"If you are looking for remote developer jobs I would check out <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;webwork.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;webwork.io</a>","time":1462213985,"type":"comment"},{"by":"sinzone","dead":true,"id":11612860,"parent":11611867,"text":"Masahpe - SF, Toronto, London<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mashape.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mashape.com&#x2F;</a><p>Jobs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;market.mashape.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;market.mashape.com&#x2F;jobs</a>","time":1462206487,"type":"comment"},{"by":"userium","dead":true,"id":11612419,"parent":11611867,"text":"Remote jobs at Automattic (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stayintech.com&#x2F;companies\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stayintech.com&#x2F;companies</a>)","time":1462204046,"type":"comment"},{"by":"isaac147","dead":true,"id":11619971,"parent":11611867,"text":"I&#x27;ve just used this guy&#x27;s services and he&#x27;s a legit black hat hacker, he can handle social network hacks, emails and school grade hacks, he&#x27;s actually the real deal, I was initially skeptical as I already got  scammed before but he did come through, his email is ethicalgenius2015@gmail.com","time":1462278893,"type":"comment"},{"by":"isaac147","dead":true,"id":11619973,"parent":11611867,"text":"I&#x27;ve just used this guy&#x27;s services and he&#x27;s a legit black hat hacker, he can handle social network hacks, emails and school grade hacks, he&#x27;s actually the real deal, I was initially skeptical as I already got  scammed before but he did come through, his email is ethicalgenius2015@gmail.com","time":1462278900,"type":"comment"},{"by":"hackband","dead":true,"id":11615537,"parent":11611867,"text":"Actimo | On-site (Copenhagen, Denmark)<p>Innovative messaging SaaS platform, giving our customers a brand new way of reaching out.
