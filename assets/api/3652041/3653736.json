Today, we are building the best way to book a flight on your phone. We've taken the arduous process of today that requires 8 screens and 31 actions and reduced it to 4 beautiful screens and 8 simple touches. See the app at <a href=\"http://embarkair.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://embarkair.com</a>. But the vision for tomorrow is to allow people to be productive anywhere. To do what RIM originally did for email for all common tasks. And what the iPhone did for the mobile web. We believe phones will soon become our primary devices, yet many tasks are still too difficult to complete on a phone today. There is too little personalization, too much data for the little screens and too many steps to complete a transaction.<p>Booking a flight is the first task we have solved and the big vision is to build a platform that is the best way to complete complex tasks. Period. Our beta testers love the app and booking experience and we are gearing up for a wider release in the near future.<p>I'm looking for a lead designer -- someone with a keen eye and experience creating clean simple interfaces. Our focus is on eliminating steps and reducing the number of touches -- while making information  clear and easy to digest.<p>I'm also looking for an iOS or backend developer -- someone with experience developing in iOS, an interest in simplicity and creating beautiful interactions and a snappy app. On the backend, we are a python shop -- nginx, tornado, mysql. Someone that likes to get their hands dirty working with 3rd party APIs and optimizing for speed!<p>We are offering a decent salary, significant equity and a chance to lead this new company.<p>To learn more and apply please email me at wferrell@embarkair.com","time":1330631881,"type":"comment"}
