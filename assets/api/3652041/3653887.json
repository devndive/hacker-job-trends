We've got a lot of great code at the moment; heavy use of Backbone.js to keep the codebase manageable, and we're actively ensuring that we're not held back by legacy browser support. But we've got a lot more that we want to do, and we need your help.<p>* You should be able to think yourself into the user's mind and understand the difference between making complex\noperations seem simple, and treating the user like a moron.<p>* You should have a healthy respect for the issues involved in making rich and usable applications over an asynchronous, unreliable network - and also for the rewards that come from doing it right where few others can.<p>* You should have strong opinions on web usability and design, and be unafraid to express them.<p>* You need to have rock solid JS skills, and a robust understanding of modern HTML and CSS implementations.<p>* You should be used to working in a collaborative environment where everything is run through version control and every line of code is reviewed.<p>* And if you've got a github profile with a portfolio of work for us to look at, we'd be over the moon.<p>Apply to jobs@timetric.com","time":1330634020,"type":"comment"}
