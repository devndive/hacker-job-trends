We're now a tight-knit, cross-functional team of 8 people, and we think of ourselves as a small startup inside of a larger company. We're dedicated to helping startups and small teams become better at what they do.<p>If you think you might be interested in working with us, get in touch with Niki at: niki@agilezen.com","time":1330614541,"type":"comment"}
