This is an amazing opportunity for someone who wants to have a large amount of responsibility and say in not only what is built, but how we go about building it (Lean + sprint.ly + validation === fun).<p>Currently the stack includes a custom build of Nginx, PHP5.3 (lithium), MongoDB, Redis, memcached combo, and that grows as our needs will. Local sandboxes are configured using Chef, Vagrant, VirtualBox, git - and it comes with a MBP w/ display(s) of your choosing to boot.<p>If you're passionate and smart (and know Python/Java), there's going to be a huge opportunity for some serious data analysis, recommendation and visualization as we build out our discovery engine based on the huge amounts of manifests, trade documents, behavioral and product data that we aggregate from and about our industry.<p>We're funded, we're growing, we enjoy working with each other (but we like to go home at the end of the day as well), and we'd love to hear from you.<p>techjobs@tigertrade.com","time":1330641573,"type":"comment"}
