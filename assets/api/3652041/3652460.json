Among other things, we work when we're most productive, choose our tasks, avoid meetings and distractions, provide any equipment, go to conferences, test our code, automate, have an interesting market and fun product, and constantly improve. We pay above-market salaries, have excellent benefits, and generously share ownership. Each person on the team is good enough to help us improve.<p>i.TV is about making TV better by delivering interesting content to your phone/iPad/laptop in sync with what's on your TV. It's a huge opportunity to both improve the usefulness of TV and to create a place for TV advertisers to engage with the audience. We have successfully launched several products, including our popular iOS and Android Guides, and work with many national partners including Time Inc and Aol. We are well funded, and are close to launching a new product that will revolutionize the way we watch TV.<p>We use Node.js, MongoDB, HTML5/JS/CSS, iOS, and Android, but overall programming skill is most important than any particular specialty.<p>Please contact Sean Hess at jobs@i.tv","time":1330616020,"type":"comment"}
