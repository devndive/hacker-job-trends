We're looking for sharp, empathetic software developers, mainly working on web (Rails, JS) and mobile (iPhone, Android) projects. Past clients include Groupon, Twitter, Google, Gowalla. We also build Pivotal Tracker, an agile project management tool.\nYou don't have to be an expert in Rails or the mobile frameworks to get a job here - as long as you are pleasant to work with and willing to learn, that's good enough. Since we pair every day, you'll pick up what you need to know very quickly. After just a month at Pivotal I felt I had improved leaps and bounds as a developer and learnt a tremendous amount about Rails that I didn't know before.\nGive me a ping - thomas@pivotallabs.com.
