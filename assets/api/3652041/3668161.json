Full time.<p>Front-end Developer at Newspaper Club.<p><a href=\"http://www.newspaperclub.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.newspaperclub.com</a><p>We help anyone make and print their own newspapers. We believe the web is too important to be left to screens, and that newsprint is a highly evolved technology too. We build things that combine the two, using each medium for what it's best at.<p>We're looking for a great front-end developer to work alongside our co-founder and engineer (me, @tomtaylor) and form the start of a tight knit development team.<p>You'd be our first engineering hire, and we're looking for someone with solid Javascript experience, but happy to get stuck in across the whole stack. Enthusiasm and attitude count for more than lines on the CV.<p>If you're interested, drop us a line at jobs@newspaperclub.com, with a note about yourself and links to things you think we'd find interesting (eg. Github account, CV, portfolio).","time":1330978585,"type":"comment"}
