Projects include working with data startups in Silicon Valley, building institutional CMS websites, and custom web applications. I'm looking to hire someone interested in touching all aspects of the business – from project specifications and wire-framing through design development and backend programming to client relations and code maintenance. Only requirement is that you are familiar (1-2 years experience) with OOP and PHP/MySQL. If you have interest in the other stuff, I will help teach you the business. Shoot me an email to learn more or talk options.<p>If anyone wants to meet up to discuss collaboration or work opportunities during SXSW, feel free to send me an email.","time":1330620646,"type":"comment"}
