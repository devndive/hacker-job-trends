On staff is a Robocup champ, the former lead engineer for YQL, a rocket scientist turned GPU programmer, and other great engineers. Beyond being really good at what they do, the engineering staff is very friendly. We're not talking publicly about what we're building yet, but we have a well-defined mission, a clear business model, and a killer business team. Our recent Series A is from Sutter Hill Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Morado Ventures, and individuals.<p>I'm particularly eager to find an excellent operations/reliability engineer who loves to build and improve tools, a passion for quality and reliability, and a positive, friendly attitude.<p>Also very high on my priority list is a big-data processing engineer to design and build our data pipeline.<p>If you're interested, you can email me directly -- john@clover.com.<p><a href=\"https://www.clover.com/jobs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.clover.com/jobs.html</a>","time":1301672086,"type":"comment"}
