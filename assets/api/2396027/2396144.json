The people we hired are so great that instead of work halting to train them, we have increased the rate that we release new features and products and our software quality has improved too.<p>All tech people get a new MacBook Pro and monitor.  We use Ruby on Rails, git, RSpec, Cucumber, Selenium, Jenkins, and lots more good stuff.  We're the biggest player in the daily deal space so we face the biggest technical challenges - tens of millions of users, insane growth, real-time, data-based targeting at scale, defining the hottest new space (deals) on the Internet, etc.<p>Usual official stuff aside, let me share my personal experience.  I started at Groupon four months ago and I'll say that it is better in every way than every job I've ever had.  My coworkers are amazing, we do all that stuff everyone says you're supposed to do (test coverage, automated builds, scope control, regression testing, etc), the atmosphere is so fun (company meetings are the highlight of the quarter), and everything I develop gets used by millions of people, immediately.  My mom actually understands who I work for.  I honestly legitimately love it here.","time":1301665359,"type":"comment"}
