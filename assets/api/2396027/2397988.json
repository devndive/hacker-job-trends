We need product-loving engineers and product designers who are interested in online shopping and building an experience customers love.  We're also looking for summer engineering interns.<p>Our current stack is Ruby, Rails, MySQL, and Heroku, but smart and hungry beats knowledge of specific languages.<p>If you're interested send an email to jobs@everlane.com telling us why the opportunity is interesting to you, what you're looking for in a startup, and links to your resume, portfolio, github account, side projects, etc.","time":1301690910,"type":"comment"}
