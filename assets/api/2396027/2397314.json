We've got two positions -- a C++/CUDA engineer to work on the \"location\" part and a ruby engineer for the \"services\" side.<p>Our location system fuses together multiple sensor feeds to get 1m accuracy indoors.  It's a highly parallel system with agressive performance requirements and a lot of fun problems.  \"Services\" encompasses a Rails frontend, a large distributed backend, data collection and reporting.  If you like ruby but aren't 100% frontend focused you'll fit right in.<p>We're a small engineering team (currently three people, growing to six).  We practice agile development, love playing with new technologies and know how to have a good time. Experience with something unusual and unrelated to the requirements is a big plus.","time":1301681413,"type":"comment"}
