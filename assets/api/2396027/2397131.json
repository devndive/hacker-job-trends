OK I'll get it out of the way, the weather: well, yeah, there's snow/slush on the ground right now on April 1st (jokes on us), but it does make you appreciate when it is nice out a lot more.<p>We're a new company (<a href=\"http://smarterer.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://smarterer.com</a>), recently funded, with some big ideas. Not only are we exploring a space with tons of potential, but we plan on putting \"consumer web\" back on the map in the Boston startup scene.<p>There are just three of us at the moment (and only one tech person: me) so joining now means you get to have a big impact on the product, the company, the vision and the technology.<p>There are lots of interesting product, algorithm, gaming, infrastructure and scaling challenges. We're currently using Python (not Django), but we're not language-religious, anyone who loves web tech, big problems, big systems, design, products and programming might be a good fit.<p>Sorry, no remote right now. The early core team needs to be local to really gel (just from my personal and previous startup experience).<p>if you're interested, email me: mikepk@smarterer.com","time":1301678916,"type":"comment"}
