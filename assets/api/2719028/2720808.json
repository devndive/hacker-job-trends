We are well-funded, self-funded, pre-launch, and small (4 in Seattle, 2 in SF). This is an opportunity to be in the first wave and help define how we do things.<p>We're looking for a product designer who will own design for our web and device software products. We're building consumer services, and having the right design will be critical to our success. This person needs to make sure our products are simple, usable, and successful at solving problems for people. We're primarily looking for interaction design skills, but visual design ability and/or front-end prototyping ability would of course be a plus.<p>The current dev team is me plus three former Hashrocketeers in downtown Seattle. Our stack is Rails; our process is story-based, test-driven, and design-respectful. (We'd love to hear from great developers as well if you're interested -- see <a href=\"http://vurl.me/AZHL\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://vurl.me/AZHL</a>)<p>We'd prefer to keep the dev/design team in Seattle for now, but we could bend this rule for an exceptional person who wants to be in SF.<p>Misc. company facts: My co-founder used to be CEO of Sun Microsystems. We have competitive salary, equity, and benefits. Our Seattle office is in the South Lake Union area. Dogs are welcome.
