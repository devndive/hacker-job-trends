On top of that, we work on client-side applications for some of the top 200 websites worldwide.<p>With only 3 people, we're still a relatively small, but highly motivated team with high aspirations, great opportunities and an extremly optimistic outlook on the future. Joining us, you'll have the opportunity to experience rapid growth right when it's happening while actively being a part of building and growing a big company.<p>What you'll do:\nAs (Senior) Java Developer, you're in charge of diverse responsibilities and work on them either alone or in teams. You're responsible for parts of JDownloader, but on top of that will also have your own projects or products, for which you take the lead developer role.<p>Because we usually don't have strict deadlines or draconic specifications, we expect you to prioritize and get things done by yourself. You should feel cozy in your code, but also keep an eye on things like SEO strategy, project- and product management as well as user interface and experience. Your own ideas and innovations for projects, features or products are more than welcome and will actively be supported.<p>Send your resume, links to your current/past projects, social profiles or whatever you think we should know about you to e-mail@appwork.<p>We're looking forward to working with you :)","time":1309962278,"type":"comment"}
