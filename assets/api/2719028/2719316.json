Before you dismiss this as fluff with no technical challenges check out what we're working on. We are associating tens of thousands of Facebook ids with booked cruises across all cruise lines. Besides the obvious chat features (which will be available with the next updates) we want to let cruisers know who in their social graph will be on board with them or landing at their next port from another ship and so on. We are working with the largest port promotions provider to get our users relevant discounts at their next duty-free locations. We'll be providing lead generation and cruise search results for one of the most prestigious cruise travel agencies in the industry. These are just some of the few opportunities we wanted to say yes to right now.<p>Looking for iPhone, Android and server engineer (currently in Python). Full-time, intern, freelancer, whatever you can offer to help us get stuff done.<p>We are post launch, continuous deployment no funding (ask for details if interested). You'd be joining 1 2/3 developers and a business guy working out of a coffee shop. Your role would be as big as you'd want it to be.<p>Apply or ask questions at jobs@shipmateapp.com","time":1309542108,"type":"comment"}
