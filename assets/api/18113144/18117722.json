Clover recently shipped its one-millionth device and we process over USD $60B in annualized GPV.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in scalability, either at the operational level (e.g. 10,000 TPS this year to 20,000 TPS the next) or at the institutional level (e.g. growing from 150 engineers to 300), then please don’t hesitate to reach out. Some recent projects we’ve been working on:<p><pre><code>  - Decomposing a monolithic Java backend into a set of modular services.\n  - Strategic migration from on-premises infrastructure to public cloud. We use both AWS and GCP.\n  - Design and development of a high-throughput, low-latency OLAP pipeline, backed by Kafka and Snowflake.\n  - Design and development of a horizontally-scalable MySQL database layer for sharding tens of terabytes of tenant data.\n  - Tooling for load test automation and analysis within our SDLC. We use Python and Locust to synthesize the workload.\n</code></pre>\nzac at clover dot com","time":1538437421,"type":"comment"}
