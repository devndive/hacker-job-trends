They&#x27;re considering both local and remote candidates. It&#x27;s been a positive experience for me and they place a lot of trust (and responsibility) in their developers to do good work. It has been helpful for me to be comfortable with independent work going into this role, and I believe a successful future team member would also be confident in their ability to take initiative in developing a new software product. The team is nothing but very genuine, helpful, and kind people who all work together very well. I&#x27;ve been 100% remote from the start and being remote has been a wonderful experience. My team has been very accommodating and cooperative despite the distance. I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to work remotely as a developer, or for someone who values working with a team of good-hearted people.<p>Here&#x27;s the Indeed posting which also includes the salary range for this position: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indeed.com&#x2F;job&#x2F;full-stack-laravel-developer-97af846af530d00a\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indeed.com&#x2F;job&#x2F;full-stack-laravel-developer-97af...</a>","time":1538494080,"type":"comment"}
