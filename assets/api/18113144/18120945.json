If you are a Site Reliability Engineer in particular, we&#x27;d love to speak with you!<p>Our SRE team is building a deployment platform that supports millions of at-home classes taken each month by our customers. We have numerous opportunities for automation and development, and value partnering with developers to help deliver value rather than just fighting fires. Instead, the SRE team&#x27;s goal is to make sure that our developers can get their job done in the most frictionless way possible, so that new features and improvements can reach our user base faster (and bugs get squashed easier!)<p>Our infrastructure is in AWS where we leverage several AWS services. We manage our infrastructure with Terraform and Chef, and code primarily in Python. Weâ€™re spending time now working on scaling our CI&#x2F;CD story, and investigating use of technologies like Kubernetes and Spinnaker for deployment.<p>If you&#x27;d be interested in learning more, feel free to contact will@onepeloton.com.<p>Hope to hear from you!","time":1538483938,"type":"comment"}
