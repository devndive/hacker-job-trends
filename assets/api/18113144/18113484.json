We help banks manage their large and complex construction loan portfolio using intelligent automation and integrated payments. Unlike a typical loan, a construction loan isn’t a single payment. Instead, it’s broken up into monthly payments called draws. That monthly draw process is complicated, with many stakeholders and hundreds or thousands of documents. Currently, all of this is managed with excel spreadsheets, PDFs, emails, and paper checks.<p>Our software helps lenders, developers, and other stakeholders produce and process this documentation automatically, leading to fewer errors, faster payments, and more profitable loans.<p>We’re currently small (10 employees), YC-backed, and are already working with several of the largest lenders in the industry. You’d be working directly with the founders in a company that values being purposeful, efficient, authentic, transparent, curious, and agile.<p>STACK<p>Experience in one&#x2F;all of the following is appreciated, but we believe tool-specific knowledge is considerably less important than the fundamentals:<p>Elixir, Phoenix, GraphQL, React, Apollo, Python, sklearn, Kubernetes, Docker, and more!<p>GET IN TOUCH<p>Junior Devs (1-3 years of experience): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hire.withgoogle.com&#x2F;public&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;contractsimplycom&#x2F;view&#x2F;P_AAAAAAFAADjJQmJi1dSu4m?trackingTag=hackerNewsWhoSHiring\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hire.withgoogle.com&#x2F;public&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;contractsimplycom&#x2F;vi...</a><p>Senior Devs (4+ years of experience): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hire.withgoogle.com&#x2F;public&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;contractsimplycom&#x2F;view&#x2F;P_AAAAAAFAADjHwNnDDhG2sY?trackingTag=hackerNewsWhoSHiring\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hire.withgoogle.com&#x2F;public&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;contractsimplycom&#x2F;vi...</a><p>Other positions: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hire.withgoogle.com&#x2F;public&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;contractsimplycom\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hire.withgoogle.com&#x2F;public&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;contractsimplycom</a>","time":1538407585,"type":"comment"}
