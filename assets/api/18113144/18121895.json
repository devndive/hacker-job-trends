Working closely with the CTO you will be responsible for laying the foundations upon which our frontend applications are built. You will be free to chose the tools and technologies most appropriate for our frontend stack.<p>This role is a great learning opportunity for anyone who has specialized in JS development and wishes to become more of a full stack engineer. As only the second engineer we have not solved all our problems yet, and whilst this is primarily a frontend development role, you will need to roll up your sleeves and be hands-on with many different parts of our technology stack.","time":1538489826,"type":"comment"}
