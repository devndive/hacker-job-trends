The mechanism we use to do this is counterintuitive, but once grasped will genuinely change the way you think about blockchain. We are proud to be supported by the smartest people in Asia:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@SaitoOfficial&#x2F;saito-raises-2-million-usd-in-seed-round-5d53e830188a\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@SaitoOfficial&#x2F;saito-raises-2-million-usd...</a><p>Right now we are looking to hire three people. We need someone great with UI&#x2F;UX who can help us improve our core blockchain applications (email, payment channels, social networks and more). We need an experienced engineer to help develop features in our core code (currently NodeJS), and we need a network scaling engineer to help us push network capacity between Asia and North America to its theoretical limits among other things. We have some write-ups here:<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;org.saito.tech&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;open-positions&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;org.saito.tech&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;open-positions&#x2F;</a><p>Things you should know about us: we are a smaller team (four people) planning to be in Beijing for about a year. And while we&#x27;re not committed to China long-term and expect to be flexible with remote work eventually, we do need anyone who joins us to spend a non-trivial amount of time in Asia this coming year. We can also guarantee this is an adventure worth taking. Interested? Please message me directly -- questions on the job or our scaling method all welcome -- my email address is in my HN profile.","time":1538547499,"type":"comment"}
