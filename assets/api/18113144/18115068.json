We’re a Public Benefit Corporation (and certified B-Corp) with a mission of helping entrepreneurs and making capitalism work better for local communities.<p>To date, we’ve helped startups and small businesses raise $70M from our community of $180k people. Currently, we have 16 people full-time and have raised $7.2M using our own product. The engineering team is small but effective: we’re currently two MIT grads.<p>You’d be helping us build new products (e.g. community tools for founders&#x2F;investors) and make what we already have work better.
