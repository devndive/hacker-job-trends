The ultimate goal is to enable a proof of some or all aspects of memory safety of the repaired program.  By repairing at the level of source code (as opposed to a compiler pass, like AddressSanitizer or SoftBound+CETS), the user isnâ€™t tied to a particular build chain.  Furthermore, although the goal is to as automatic as possible, nevertheless it is likely that the developer will need to manually tune performance-critical sections of the codebase, which is facilitated by doing the repair at the source-code level.<p>We are looking to hire someone with experience in static analysis, compiler development, or formal verification.  The successful candidate will both work on advanced research projects and work directly with customers to help transition our research into practice.  Candidates will be subject to a background check and must be eligible to obtain and maintain a Department of Defense security clearance.<p>If interested, please email your resume to me at weklieber+hiring@sei(DOT)cmu(DOT)edu.","time":1538427255,"type":"comment"}
