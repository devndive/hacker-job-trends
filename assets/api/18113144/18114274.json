We&#x27;re at many of the largest pharmaceutical and biotech institutions in the world. We enable the outsourced workflows which increase efficiencies and facilitate compliance. And we&#x27;re growing.<p>What you would do: The web application is in great shape but we need to answer more business questions. We want to provide data and tools to our finance and business analysts based on events from the application. The first big project would be maintaining an ETL pipeline for loading data in to AWS Redshift and supporting our internal customers with Quicksight or Tableau.<p>You would be collaborating with experienced application owners who know the datas ins and outs, you would not be learning the system in a vacuum. That won&#x27;t be the end of it, we&#x27;d also like to support more developer friendly tools like Jupyter.<p>You&#x27;d also be supporting the Kubernetes cluster, helping to track system health, improving our CI&#x2F;CD system, internal metrics and logging, performing cluster upgrades, and doing a variety of security ops. I think this part is more minor but any experience with operating Kubernetes is desired. If you like Rust, this also a great job for you, I&#x27;d love to have utilities or even small webapps written in Rust.<p>You can apply here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;apmN3F\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;apmN3F</a>\nIf you have any questions, email me at xavier@scientist.com","time":1538411754,"type":"comment"}
