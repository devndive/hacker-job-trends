Today we give florists the tools to create and deliver beautifully crafted bouquets to our online communities. In the next 12 months, our online offering will grow as we launch in 5 new cities across the UK and US, and introduce the very first vertically integrated florists SaaS. From inventory management to a wholesale shop, and even website builders and POS systems. We will offer florists everything they need, ultimately allowing customers to get exactly what they ordered in the picture, on the very same day.<p>Tech Stack: React, Node.js, GraphQL","time":1538419845,"type":"comment"}
