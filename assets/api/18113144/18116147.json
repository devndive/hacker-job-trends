We are developing an automated process for creating perfectly fitting jeans. Starting from a customer’s 3D body scan, our system generates customized pattern pieces that are then assembled on-demand. This removes the need for inventory and eliminates unnecessary waste. We’re building this by leveraging tools like Blender’s Python API and CGAL to automate the steps necessary to go from a surface mesh of a body scan to customized apparel pattern DXFs<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;unspun&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;428124-software-engineer-computational-geometry\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;unspun&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;428124-software-engineer-comput...</a><p>If you think you&#x27;re a good fit for this role, you can reach me at stephen@unspuntech.com.","time":1538423337,"type":"comment"}
