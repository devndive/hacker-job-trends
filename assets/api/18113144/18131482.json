Our customers build rockets, drones, medical devices, and much more - working at Tempo means you can accelerate all of these industries at once. Providing a system to produce circuit boards quickly and correctly means we&#x27;re both a software shop and an advanced manufacturer. Our software team is still pretty small (9 engineers) which means any new hires will still have an outsize impact on the direction of our technology, and on the company as a whole. We love hiring strong generalists [python experience highly preferred] who take initiative and act as part-time PMs when they&#x27;re working on projects. Some projects you might work on:<p><pre><code>  - Offering real-time, automated manufacturing feedback based on certain parameters of our customers&#x27; designs. Think linting for hardware.\n\n  - Optimizing our factory processes with machine learning and scheduling algorithms.\n\n  - Encoding the three-dimensional structure of each order&#x27;s components (e.g. resistors, capacitors) for our assembly robots, in order to speed up assembly and ensure minimal manufacturing defects.\n\n  - Optimizing our automated optical inspection machine to make it faster than any in the industry.\n</code></pre>\nTech Stack: Python | Django | React | Redux | PostgreSQL | AWS<p>We&#x27;re also excited to have just moved into a MUCH larger factory and headquarters (&gt;4x the floor space) in SoMa.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, please apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tempoautomation.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tempoautomation.com&#x2F;careers</a> or send a note to austin [at] tempoautomation [dot] com.","time":1538582049,"type":"comment"}
