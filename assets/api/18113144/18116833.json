I&#x27;m a recent CTO and also the person that&#x27;s referenced at the top of these monthly post for the past few years. We&#x27;ve had a few companies that have unicorned out of Santa Monica, essentially based on our idea. FireflyOn, the people who put screens on top of ubers, had us in their slidedeck. We&#x27;ve got a number of attack vectors and partnerships in our response and need more resources to execute them.<p>Our users love us and we have somewhat of a cult following. Now it&#x27;s time to grow the cult. I&#x27;m authoring our revolution round 2 and this time we&#x27;re not going to let it slip away by Bird and Lime like the last one.<p>I&#x27;m trying to (as of about a week ago) now aggressively build a large team so we scale or fail. We&#x27;re changing our strategy and you can be a part of it.  Here&#x27;s a partial list of people we need:<p>* Solid mobile app developers<p>* Backend or full-stack<p>* Designers<p>* Hardware specialists with EE experience<p>* Mechanical Engineers to help build the next-gen of our screens<p>We&#x27;re in a large system-wide overhaul and removing all the anti-scaling valves we have in place. I need people who want to aggressively move products forward and think big.<p>We offer competitive salaries and all that, sure. But if you just want a job, go elsewhere. You need to have a unwavering passion to build infrastructure.  I&#x27;m here to kick ass and you should be too.<p>How to apply: Email me chris(at)waive.car. Text or call me 657 210 1337. Don&#x27;t be shy.<p>Let&#x27;s do this.","time":1538428152,"type":"comment"}
