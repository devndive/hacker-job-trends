I&#x27;m a developer who has been working at Cogent for the past 6 years and I love it here. I moved across the world for this job and I haven&#x27;t regretted it for a second. Cogent is a lovely, warm and humane company. I&#x27;ve managed to convince my boss to let me travel the world and work remotely a couple of months per year. I also work part-time so that I can work on my videography business, and nobody raises an eyebrow at that. It&#x27;s all very flexible!<p>Cogent is kind of a consultancy. We have a vision of becoming &quot;Melbourne&#x27;s most loved maker of novel digital businesses&quot;. So a lot of what we do is based on working out of clients&#x27; offices. But we do other things as well. I spend my time working on a pretty damn cool electric car charger startup we&#x27;ve invested in.<p>We&#x27;re a values-driven company, which gives us benefits such as an open salaries model, profit share and a strong focus on work-life balance like the flexibility mentioned above. We also work with clients that align well with our values.<p>Cogent is looking for mid-level and senior software developers with 5+ years of experience. We use Ruby and JS quite a bit, so commercial experience with those would make us go &quot;ooooh!&quot;<p>If this sounds interesting, have a look at our site: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cogent.co\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cogent.co</a><p>Or drop me an email to ask me about life at Cogent or in Australia: peter@cogent.co","time":1538462925,"type":"comment"}
