When we make a decision to do something, we acknowledge and document the ramifications of that decision, including the things we&#x27;re _not_ doing. We write code and design systems that we&#x27;ll be proud of, and when that&#x27;s not the case, we acknowledge, document, and prioritize fixes appropriately.<p>ChatLingual gives businesses access to new markets by removing one of the oldest barriers to entry: language.
