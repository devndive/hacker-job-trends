We’re changing HR the same way Salesforce did sales and Hubspot did marketing: we empower functional leaders with better data products and insights to create strategic value for their firms.<p>We&#x27;re hiring a Data&#x2F;Platform Engineer to create the enterprise-scale infrastructure that drives our business. This includes everything from designing data flows and ETL pipelines, to architecting our core data models and schemas, to building services and interfaces that deliver data to our product endpoints.<p>We’ve generated amazing traction and a product users love, but we’re still small - you’ll work directly with the early team and have full autonomy and leadership over your domain. Primary technologies include Airflow, Python, React&#x2F;Redux, and growing for scale.<p>Send me a note at nikhil@twinelabs.com","time":1538444648,"type":"comment"}
