Much experience with javascript&#x2F;html&#x2F;css. Ability to make something look good as well as functional a bonus. Passion for product also something we look for in the right fit. Although we are currently using React for most, we are experimenting with other lightweight tooling and standards that allow for easier consumption of our widgets by all frameworks&#x2F;libraries.<p>We pride ourselves as being a small, nimble group that cuts out as much as possible the non-value-add things from work and focuses instead on good lifestyle for our employees and a great product for our customers. jobs@chatlio.com  Cheers.","time":1538433015,"type":"comment"}
