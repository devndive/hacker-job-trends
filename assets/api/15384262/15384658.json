Join us, and you&#x27;ll gain deep experience developing systems at scale and working with a world-class data science team (winners of multiple KDD Best Paper and other awards). We&#x27;re still pretty small on the engineering team, and everyone gets their hands dirty and makes a real impact.<p>We&#x27;re mostly a Java shop. Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Cassandra, and Kafka are big parts of our stack, and we&#x27;re always looking for new tech that helps us work at scale. Experience with these is a big plus, but if you&#x27;ve never used them before that&#x27;s fine too. If you write clean, tested, working code, think through problems, and know how to ship, we want to talk to you.<p>We play Ultimate or Soccer on Fridays, have a company band, game nights, and dev seminars where we talk tech and learn from each other. We keep sane hours and don&#x27;t track vacation.<p>We&#x27;re interested in how you really think through problems and write code, so for developers, our hiring process revolves around a small, self-paced take-home project that reflects some of the real work we do.<p>Please check out our job postings to apply:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dstillery.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;listings&#x2F;#d15502\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dstillery.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;listings&#x2F;#d15502</a><p>Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions at:\noferrer@dstillery.com","time":1506958882,"type":"comment"}
