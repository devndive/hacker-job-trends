We&#x27;re looking for experienced engineers that will work with mostly python codebase within a distributed company. We use Elixir, Elm, Heroku, Google Cloud and many other tools. We love open-source and care deeply about code quality. A bonus having experience working with Applicant Tracking Systems ;)<p>We work on flexible hours, offer unlimited vacation days, go out for weekly team activities and once a year bring the whole company together on an international gathering to reconnect outside of our work. We attend local&#x2F;international conferences.<p>Remote work is possible for a right candidate, but it requires spending some time in London.<p>Contact me directly: lukasz@rolepoint.com (I&#x27;m based in Krak√≥w, Poland if someone wants to talk in person)<p>More info <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.rolepoint.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.rolepoint.com</a><p>API docs <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rolepoint-connect.readme.io&#x2F;v1&#x2F;docs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rolepoint-connect.readme.io&#x2F;v1&#x2F;docs</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rolepoint\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rolepoint</a>","time":1506976214,"type":"comment"}
