Our core product is used for managing the recruiting process (primarily focused on executive recruiting, but we&#x27;re used by all kinds of search firms, in-house recruiters, and VCs). We&#x27;re in Haddonfield, NJ, which is a quick 20-minute PATCO ride from Philadelphia (lots of us come in from Philly). We prefer folks be onsite but are flexible with allowing remote work on occasion.<p>Our dev team currently consists of 2 senior developers and 4 juniors. We&#x27;d like to add another experienced senior dev. Our app uses Ruby on Rails on the backend, so experience there would be great. We also use Postgres, Elasticsearch, Redis, and RabbitMQ. We&#x27;re currently transitioning our frontend to a React+redux SPA (we&#x27;re maybe halfway there, so we do still have quite a bit of server-generated pages).<p>Apply and&#x2F;or see more job details here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.thriveapp.ly&#x2F;job&#x2F;2\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.thriveapp.ly&#x2F;job&#x2F;2</a><p>More about the company: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thrivetrm.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thrivetrm.com&#x2F;</a><p>Questions?
