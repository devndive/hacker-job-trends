This helps them reach peak productivity, stay well-informed, and reduces the friction inherent in collaboration. Layer achieves this by integrating with the main tools they use every day (version control, code hosting, project management, continuous integration, communication, etc.), structuring that data, and making it searchable via a desktop application.<p>We’re also building the better git-blame plugin for Atom. The plugin does more than just display git blame in the gutter - it pulls in info about pull requests &amp; related issues and helps you visualise the blame info.<p>You will be leveraging a modern tech-stack to work through some complex problems and push the limits of what people expect from dev tools. We’re a very small team (6), so you’ll have a huge impact on technology choices&#x2F;practices, the product, and the culture of the team.<p>- Full-Stack&#x2F;Front-End Engineer (JS) | £40k-£80k | up to 1% equity | <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stepsize.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;full-stack-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stepsize.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;full-stack-engineer</a>","time":1506968187,"type":"comment"}
