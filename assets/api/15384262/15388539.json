I&#x27;m Dave and I&#x27;m looking for a front-end engineer with a designer&#x27;s heart to come help me build out pattern libraries and component systems for use at Elastic (makers of Elasticsearch and Kibana). Specifically it would be working in a lot of React, Sass and SVGs. Your code would be fully open source. The design team here is small and this is a unique opportunity to build out design that is consumed by a large team of engineers. The company is fully distributed and has the usual bevy of great benefits. If you have great attention to detail and know the ins and outs of scaling a component library I&#x27;d love to talk with you.<p>If interested feel free to apply at<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elastic.co&#x2F;about&#x2F;careers&#x2F;engineering&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;825257\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elastic.co&#x2F;about&#x2F;careers&#x2F;engineering&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;825257</a><p>Engineers in general are more than welcome to peruse the other jobs at Elastic, of which there are quite a few.","time":1506983547,"type":"comment"}
