Our small, dedicated, and compassionate team is looking for an exceptional mobile software engineer to help us in the quest for ever greater public access to information. Join us in our efforts at the main NYPL branch location (of Ghostbusters fame) and you&#x27;ll experience the pleasure of working full-time on open-source software, enjoy a healthy work-life balance, and sleep well at night knowing you&#x27;re doing what&#x27;s best for library patrons, not someone else&#x27;s bottom line.<p>Our native apps are written primarily in Objective-C and Java with new development being undertaken in Swift and Kotlin. We&#x27;re looking for an Android or iOS expert who is eager to eventually contribute on both mobile platforms. You should be competent with Git, know a thing or two about SQL, and understand the basics of JavaScript and DOM manipulation. Knowledge of the EPUB format, familiarity with building accessible apps, and a good understanding of functional programming are major plusses.<p>Ready to improve the experiences of library patrons around the US? Send your résumé to &quot;info@librarysimplified.org&quot; and let us know!","time":1506959678,"type":"comment"}
