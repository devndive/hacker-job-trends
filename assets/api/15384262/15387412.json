We’re starting with sales teams because they’re a particularly notorious black box. No manager today can definitively say what makes a “top performer” better than a “low performer.” People.ai is solving this dilemma by making sales management transparent and building the world’s first predictive sales management platform, powered by AI.<p>People.ai was part of the YC S’16 batch, launched the product in July of 2016 and was the first company in the batch to raise a Series A. Less than three months after our launch we were already being used by sales teams at 50+ blue chip companies including Rubrik, Gainsight, Mulesoft and Optimizely.<p>We have a 10+ person team and are actively looking for Senior Python Engineers to join us. Our team needs someone with expert level in Python 2.x&#x2F;3.x with at least 5 years of experience in programming as well as a deep background in Linux, AWS, REST APIs and machine learning. Salesforce API experience is a plus!<p>Our Sales team is looking for Enterprise Account Executives and Sales Development Representatives.  A background in on-demand&#x2F;SaaS, CRM, SFA or marketing software sales is strongly preferred. You must have a proven record of consistently meeting and exceeding quota in a fast-paced, competitive sales environment.<p>Apply here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peopleai.workable.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peopleai.workable.com&#x2F;</a>","time":1506974506,"type":"comment"}
