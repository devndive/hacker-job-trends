We&#x27;re looking for a data scientist to improve our automatic classification system.<p>We&#x27;re a UCL AI spin out. You&#x27;ll be collaborating with specialist AI and privacy researchers and an experienced generalist development team.<p>We basically ingest arbitrary data (usually structured -- think sql dump files), normalise it, classify it and then anonymise it. One of our core challenges is to develop our classifier into an expert system that learns whilst preserving privacy in the training data.<p>We envisage that you&#x27;ve got a relevant degree and some professional experience working with data pipelines and machine learning based data classification. An interest in privacy and anonymisation would be great.<p>We&#x27;re based in London. We just raised a seed round from four leading early stage VC funds. You&#x27;ll be employee #3.<p>This is a remote role (we&#x27;re a remote-first development team), although you will need to spend some face time in London every so often.<p>If this sounds interesting, drop me an email on thruflo@anon.ai explaining why along with your CV and &#x2F; or profile links.<p>Thanks!","time":1506967272,"type":"comment"}
