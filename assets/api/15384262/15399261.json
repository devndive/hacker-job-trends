We are currently expanding the team and have vacancies for front end developers, mid&#x2F;senior python engineers and data analysts. We don&#x27;t put our development team in a box but expect them to be involved from strategy to delivery, working collaboratively with the entire team to find unique solutions to some amazing briefs. To help facilitate this we have our own bar in the office and the cupboards are always stocked with snacks and treats. Most importantly we have an awesome development and creative team in place and are looking for more like-minded people who will keep pushing the agency forward.<p>A small sample of the technologies, languages and frameworks we use include AngularJS, Three.js, Django, Flask and Google App Engine.
