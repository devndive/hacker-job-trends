We are a team of 13 full-time and on-site employees, roughly split half and half between engineering+design and support. We have a comprehensive pair of mobile apps that integrate into our web based service, allowing users to record and navigate their bike rides, as well as a website that allows our users to create and discover new rides.<p>We are looking to grow our development team. My co-founder and I both are part-time backend devs, and we have a dedicated Rails engineer who will be taking on some more infrastructure&#x2F;dev-ops related tasks, so our immediate need is someone with solid Rails or other backend experience. Skills are prioritized over knowledge of specific frameworks. We would also love to hear from a mobile dev with extensive UX passion and experience, to round out our technically strong mobile team. Finally, we can always use another solid frontend engineer who has React or other similar experience.<p>Our team is comprised of various types of cyclists, some more passionate than others, and all enjoying a mix of biking related activities. MTB &#x2F; Adventure &#x2F; Road &#x2F; Race &#x2F; Commute are all well represented, and we respect a wide variety of bicycling experience. We offer excellent work&#x2F;life balance, competitive salaries, and love to support our employees with anything cycling related. We provide excellent fully covered health&#x2F;vision&#x2F;dental, a 10% matched 401k, and a bike budget to spend after your first 90 days. We are family friendly (a third of our team have kids) and offer paid maternity&#x2F;paternity leave.<p>Contact cullen@ridewithgps.com for details. Please include a resume and a brief email based cover letter explaining your experience in the industry, as well as your personal experiences with cycling.<p>Thanks!","time":1506970715,"type":"comment"}
