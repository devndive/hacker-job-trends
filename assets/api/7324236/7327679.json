Our first product targets commercial leasing teams, who run a highly mobile and collaborative workflow using tools like paper (!) and 90s-era desktop productivity software (yes, I&#x27;m looking at you, Excel).<p>Our founding team is Brandon Weber, a HCI graduate from CMU and former commercial real estate broker, me - Niall Smart, founder of YC W09 company Echodio (sold to RealNetworks) and Donald DeSantis, founder at LIFFFT, Giant Thinkwell, and an early Redfin employee. We’re backed by top-tier investors in enterprise tech and CRE, including Thrive Capital (42Floors, Honest Buildings, Urban Compass), BVP (Box, Intercom, Clearside), Aaron Levie, Lee Linden, David Tisch and Gary Vaynerhuck [1]<p>If reimagining the technology toolset used by an entire industry is the kind of thing that floats your boat, come talk to us – we&#x27;re still a small team, and you can have a huge impact. We’re currently hiring full stack web developers who have a solid portfolio of building product at startups. Our stack is Rails + AngularJS + iOS. Knowledge of CRE is not a pre-requisite.<p>Drop me a line to learn more – niall.smart (at) gethightower.com.<p>Cheers,<p>Niall<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.pehub.com/2013/12/hightower-grabs-2-12-mln-in-seed-funds/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pehub.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;12&#x2F;hightower-grabs-2-12-mln-in-see...</a>","time":1393733530,"type":"comment"}
