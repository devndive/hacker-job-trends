We have iOS, Android, and web apps.<p>* An omnivorous transport data processor. We fuse together loads of data sources (of wildly varying quality) to give people the information they need in a growing number of cities around the world. We use a lot of Python, but are open to new ideas.<p>* A fast, scalable stable of servers. We have a large user base which relies on us to give them snappy answers every day. We use Saltstack to deploy on AWS.<p>* A psychic city brain. We&#x27;re digging up patterns in urban data to tell people the answers they need to know about their commute before they know the questions.<p>Please email me at emil@citymapper.com or apply via <a href=\"http://citymapper.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;citymapper.com&#x2F;jobs</a>","time":1393701875,"type":"comment"}
