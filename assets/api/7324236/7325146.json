We have traction and revenue and funding and great customers. Our customers love us, because we move quickly, build great things, and provide amazing support. Everyone talks to customers a lot.<p>We&#x27;re still a small team, so you&#x27;ll have a large impact on company culture. We&#x27;re highly influenced by Valve&#x27;s Employee handbook and Stripe and GitHub&#x27;s cultures, and have as flat a structure as we can. We&#x27;re looking for frontend engineers (JS), designers (must be able to HTML+CSS), and backend engineers (Clojure). Being a mix of those is of course welcome! We lean towards senior experienced engineers, or junior engineers who can display great talent.<p>We&#x27;re also looking for engineers for Developer Success and Developer Awareness positions. Since we have an incredibly technical product, and selling directly to developers, the dev-awareness positions (think marketing, but much more dev-oriented: dev evangelism, writing interesting blogs, CRO, analytics, etc - think a patio11-style engineer) require significant development experience. Dev-success positions are a good fit for engineers who like working with people and building relationships with customers.<p>Check out our jobs page at <a href=\"https://circleci.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;circleci.com&#x2F;jobs</a>.","time":1393694770,"type":"comment"}
