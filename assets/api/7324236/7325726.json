The team was actually one of the first production users of Node.js, but we also have C&#x2F;C++ and Scala in the stack today.<p>I know Uber is also looking for Android devs, PostgreSQL experts, Python devs, &quot;big&quot; data&#x2F;data science&#x2F;ML people and systems&#x2F;devops. Basically if you are smart we are growing really fast.<p>I&#x27;m sure most people have heard of Uber but if I can answer any questions I&#x27;m @sh1mmer on Twitter and my email is tomc at uber dot com.<p>You can see all the open jobs here:<p><a href=\"https://www.uber.com/jobs/?gh_src=ft3spo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uber.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;?gh_src=ft3spo</a>","time":1393702136,"type":"comment"}
