We provide a free DNS service that powers 2% of the internet. The 50 billion daily DNS queries that we serve provide a way to study how the internet - including malicious software - communicates.<p>The results are pretty cool: <a href=\"http://www.opendns.com/2013/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opendns.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;</a><p>We don&#x27;t just stop there - we just announced a new tool for studying malware that uses DNS to sinkhole potentially malicious websites. We can point a website at a sinkhole using our DNS resolvers, and get granular data from the TCP packets that allow us to understand how the server is used.<p><a href=\"http://labs.umbrella.com/2014/02/28/dns-sinkhole/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;labs.umbrella.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;28&#x2F;dns-sinkhole&#x2F;</a><p>We had an amazing week at RSA Conference, and we seek talented people with interests in security and big data to join our team in San Francisco and Vancouver.","time":1393687142,"type":"comment"}
