We want to bring the data, the insights, and the discussion, together... into one thing. A ChartCube.<p>We are still quite small, just 5 of us. Just got our first office in downtown San Mateo and we&#x27;re ready to jam. Our ambition has recently been series-A funded by Shasta Ventures, so we&#x27;re good. And we enjoy the counsel of some awesome advisors in the Valley. You may note that it is unusual for a company that has not yet launched its product to receive a series-A. I think everyone who&#x27;s seen the demo gets really excited. Love to show you our alpha.<p>We would love to hear from anyone who groks our vision and wants to get involved. There are some awesome technical opportunities posted on the jobs page: <a href=\"https://chartcube.recruiterbox.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chartcube.recruiterbox.com&#x2F;</a><p>Feel free to get in touch - jack @ chartcube.com - for any reason at all.","time":1393721246,"type":"comment"}
