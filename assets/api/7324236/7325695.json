The site is very functional but a long way off where it should be in terms of design and UX. We want someone to come in with a lot of ideas to help us shape how this tool will look and feel. The application is used by thousands of scientists around the world to help them work more efficiently. Although it is corny you will get the chance to help make the world a better place by improving scientific collaboration.  We are a distributed team so there is not central office, we don’t enforce strict working hours, all we care is that we are making our users are happy.<p>Please get in touch for a chat if this is of interest. henry.oswald@sharelatex.com","time":1393701765,"type":"comment"}
