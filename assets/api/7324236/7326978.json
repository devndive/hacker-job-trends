Full-time.<p>Sift Science (<a href=\"http://siftscience.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;siftscience.com</a>) uses large-scale machine learning to fight online fraud. It&#x27;s a problem that cost U.S. merchants &gt; $10B last year, and 70% of it is organized crime. Attacks have rapidly evolved in breadth and depth, but current rule-based systems don&#x27;t scale. We&#x27;re looking for engineers of all flavors -- distributed systems, web development, data visualization, and of course, machine learning. We&#x27;re a tight-knit team that likes board games, yummy food, and solving challenging technical problems.
