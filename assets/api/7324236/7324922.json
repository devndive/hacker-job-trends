The product we are building is a fully-responsive HTML5 web application used on tablets, desktops, laptops and smartphones. We think that in educational software, usability and design have not been given enough attention so we assign a lot of importance to good UX and clean user interfaces. The stack consists of a REST API implemented in Ruby on Rails and a thick-client front-end based on the Ember.js framework.<p>We’re looking for a full-stack web developer with a passion for web development, who is well-versed in both Ruby and Javascript and who has a good sense of UX. Experience in the development of single-page apps (Ember.js, Angular, Backbone or other) is highly valued.<p>You will be<p><pre><code>    - Adding new features to the application, from extending the REST API to\n      writing the CSS\n    - Contributing to all phases of building a great product\n    - Working in a small team of developers\n    - Working remotely is fine but we would like you to join our office at\n      least once every two weeks\n</code></pre>\nThe application we’re building is changing the way K-12 students study history today. You will be an early member of Hstry and you will work with interesting web technologies in an agile environment at the LearnLaunchX offices in downtown Boston, within a team that can bring ideas to market.<p>Employee equity packages are on offer.<p>Interested?
