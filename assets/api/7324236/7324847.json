We&#x27;re hiring across the board, see a partial list here: <a href=\"https://flipboard.com/careers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flipboard.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a><p>Company is about 4 years old now, and we&#x27;ve raised a serious amount of capital to transform the media space.<p>I run our publishing platform ( <a href=\"https://flipboard.com/publishers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flipboard.com&#x2F;publishers&#x2F;</a> ), which we&#x27;re investing in heavily this year in order to scale from hundreds of publishers to thousands and beyond.<p>Our stack is a mix of Python, Java, and Node.js (with some Go, C++, and Scala here and there as well).<p>One of our big challenges in this space is ingesting content from all over the Internet and normalizing it into something sane that can be displayed beautifully across all devices via algorithmic design. We use APIs, RSS, screen scraping, and midichlorians to get articles, images, videos, you name it. If you&#x27;ve dabbled in this space before, you know that it&#x27;s a tough problem to get right. I&#x27;d argue we&#x27;re best in class right now, but there&#x27;s tons of room for improvement and we&#x27;ve only just begun.<p>If any of this sounds interesting, get in touch with me: My user name @ Flipboard","time":1393691744,"type":"comment"}
