Intrans is here to change that. We&#x27;ve deployed the world&#x27;s first mobile platform for on-demand freight shipping.<p>Over 30 billion dollars a month is spent on trucking freight around the US. Without trucks, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In such a massive market, it&#x27;s hard to believe that the entire industry still runs on landlines and fax machines. We are changing that by using location-based technology to automatically match supply and demand.\nWe&#x27;re a team of 10 and have been around for over two years. We&#x27;re growing quickly and looking for a Ruby engineer to join us.<p>If you&#x27;re ready to be part of this industrial transformation, send your resume and GitHub profile to sean@intrans.com.","time":1393735254,"type":"comment"}
