About OpenEye Scientific Software, Inc: OpenEye Scientific Software provides software to the pharmaceuticals industry for molecular modeling and cheminformatics. It has done so since 1997 in its continuing mission to provide novel software, new science and better business practices to the industry. Central to our approach is the importance of shape and electrostatics as primary variables of molecular description, platform-independent code for high-throughput 2D and 3D modeling, and a preference for the rigorous rather than the ad hoc. With offices in the United States, Germany &amp; Japan, OpenEye Scientific Software is a global company. However, with fewer than 50 employees we offer a unique working culture. We believe that work should be fun and our working environment supports this philosophy. For the third year we have been a recipient of the Alfred P.
