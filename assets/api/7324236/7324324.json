You love numbers and analytics, or the front-end and making things look and interact beautifully, or both. You grow and learn every day.  We are in Portland, Maine which is atypical for Hacker News, but is a great place to live! We aren&#x27;t looking for remote workers at this time.<p>We are a tech-startup-spinoff of the award-winning (NYC-based) agency Likeable Media, and we are looking for people that are willing to jump right in and be on our small team creating features that will be visible and impactful and used immediately.<p>We are hard-working and smart, and we love to solve challenging problems. We use a lot of node.js, javascript, python, and django.<p>You want to be a substantial contributor and are interested in the full stack of technologies from details of server configuration, back-end, front-end, and mobile platforms. You are self-disciplined, self-directed, but also detail-oriented in your communication about what choices you make and what you are doing.<p>Our product is an integrated software solution that allows small businesses to create, enhance and manage their social media presence. Likeable Local was founded in 2012 and has a deployed product that integrates with Facebook and Twitter. The software is sold on a subscription basis, allowing for attractive recurring revenue economics, and is in use by dentists, dry cleaners, florists, jewelers, and more- and we continue to expand.\nInterested?
