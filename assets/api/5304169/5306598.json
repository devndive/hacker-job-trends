(remote, Charlottesville, VA)<p>About Us: Our products help our customers measure, analyze and understand system behavior at a very deep level. There are good tools in the application and network layers, but usable tools for servers and databases are practically nonexistent. We’re fixing that, focusing first on tools for MySQL.<p>DevOps Brainiac<p>Our backend systems and infrastructure are all written in Go (it’s awesome). We are ramping up to handle a jaw-dropping amount of incoming data. Data storage involves MySQL, Cassandra and other storage technologies in a fault-tolerant, distributed environment. We're looking for someone who can switch in and out of a couple of developer and sysops roles -- writing some server software, setting up some machines, whipping up some Chef recipes, and so on. We're a small team, so the real job description is \"we need another backend/infrastructure engineer.\"<p>Front End Brainiac<p>The web app is backed by PHP and Symfony2, and fronted by a lot of JavaScript, using up-to-date technologies and frameworks. There's a lot of API interaction from JavaScript, and a complex user interface that's key for making our customers rave about the experience, not just the technology. We'd love to find someone who can hop back and forth between the PHP, D3, Angular, etc., and it's even better if they've got some design sensibilities and can help shape the product's features and functionality too. If you've got the latter skillset, then the PHP coding is optional.<p>Email us at jobs@vividcortex.com if interested.<p><a href=\"https://vividcortex.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://vividcortex.com</a>","time":1362167945,"type":"comment"}
