Most frequently Android/iOS apps with a Rails-on-Heroku back end, but there's a fair amount of other variety too (PHP/Drupal, HTML5, etc etc etc.)<p>We're loosely based in NYC, with another cluster of people in the Bay Area and a third in Delhi, but remote engineers are very welcome - most of us (including me) work remotely 90+% of the time. We prefer people with a reasonable amount of experience under their belt, but there are always exceptions. And we pay well.<p>If you're interested, email me: jon@happyfuncorp.com","time":1362182221,"type":"comment"}
