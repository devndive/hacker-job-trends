We recently raised a Series A[2] and I need some help chewing through the features on our product roadmap.<p>We're a small team so you'd have a huge influence on the direction of the company. We're looking for someone with a lot of rails-specific experience (the gem ecosystem, and the \"rails way\" of doing things, etc.). We've been working with thoughtbot for a couple months so our process, code style, etc, is heavily based on their way of doing things.<p>Benefits include:<p>* Highly competitive salary, + equity<p>* Full health and dental coverage<p>* Flexible work hours<p>* Chance of bumping into celebrity pro-athletes.<p>Full disclosure, (and maybe I shouldn't say this hereabouts), but we're a TechStars company (F12). ;-)<p>If you're interested, my email is in my HN account info. Please include \"HN\" in the subject.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.coachup.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.coachup.com</a>\n[2] <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2013/01/02/gabe-kapler-cam-neely-among-pro-athletes-investing-in-coachup/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2013/01/02/gabe-kapler-c...</a>","time":1362148983,"type":"comment"}
