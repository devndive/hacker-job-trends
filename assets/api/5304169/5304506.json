No remote.<p>I have a blog where I try to help people move to other countries and one company contacted me about helping them find people willing to move to Amsterdam (I used to live there and it's a gorgeous city!).<p>So now I'm letting people know that there are front end, UX designer and back-end jobs available there. If they like you, they'll sponsor the work permit and help you relocate.<p>Front-end work is typical HTML, Javascript. UX designer is Photoshop, Gimp, whatever you want, so long as you can do great UX work. Back-end is Perl/MySQL, but they'll train good developers.  <a href=\"http://www.overseas-exile.com/p/jobs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.overseas-exile.com/p/jobs.html</a>","time":1362150062,"type":"comment"}
