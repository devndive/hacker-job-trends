We’re venture funded and backed by an incredible group of investors, who include Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Lerer Ventures, SV Angel, Founder Collective, Joshua Schachter, and Chris Dixon.<p>We’re investing in mobile and tablet in a big way and are looking for someone to lead our iOS engineering efforts. We’re a young company with a brand new product, and are seeking a strong leader to grow with us as we grow as a company, and think it’s a great time to join and make an impact.<p>We’re tackling some interesting product and engineering challenges. To help us iterate and sustain momentum, we practice continuous deployment to the extent possible, which demands technical creativity with native Objective-C / Cocoa apps. On our backend servers, we ship upwards of twenty times a day — iOS development makes things more complex but it’s an area we’re interested in improving.<p>We ask a lot of our developers, but we offer a lot in exchange:<p>- Perks and benefits. Free lunch, an office arcade (3 cabinets!), competitive equity and salary with full benefits (health, dental, vision), take-what-you-need vacation.<p>- A great working environment, including whatever tools you need. Big monitors, the hardware setup you want. Sit-stand desks if you’re into that kind of thing.<p>- A voice in product development. Decisions aren’t made in a vacuum. Be a key player in building an amazing product.<p>- Transparency into the business. We review financials as a team monthly. Meetings aren’t held behind closed doors.<p>Our office is in Union Square, Manhattan. If you don’t live in New York City, we’ll fix that.<p>We’d love to hear from you!
