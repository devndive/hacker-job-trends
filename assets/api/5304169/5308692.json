Alot of the front-end challenges we deal with here have to do with trying to optimize our application in order to provide a great user experience when dealing with the limited hardware capabilities of certain hardware platforms we use - we think existing TV solutions are subpar, and we aim to provide something people will enjoy using.<p>Apply at careers@uxpsystems.com, or you can contact me directly at kevin.wei@uxpsystems.com.","time":1362204974,"type":"comment"}
