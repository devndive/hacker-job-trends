We have no specific requirements in terms of degrees or years of experience, some of our staff have completed high school, others have graduate degrees. We’d really like to hear from people with strong programming skills in Ruby, C&#x2F;C++, OCaml, and people with strong reverse engineering and vulnerability analysis skills. If you have experience with systems programming, program analysis (to include dynamic binary instrumentation, symbolic execution, and abstract interpretation), reverse engineering, or application and software security assessment, we’d like to talk to you.<p>Our primary location is New York City, though remote work is a possibility if the fit is right. Our salaries are competitive, benefits are generous, and our culture is relaxed. In the past, our researchers and engineers have turned their personal projects into funded work. We&#x27;d like to do that more, so if you have your own ideas we can help you work on them.<p>Working at Trail of Bits, you will work closely with some really smart people in the security industry. We also encourage our employees to talk publicly about their work at conferences and on the Internet.<p>If you are interested and would like to know more, send an e-mail with your resume to dan@trailofbits.com","time":1404237824,"type":"comment"}
