We&#x27;re not overly concerned with the frameworks or libraries you&#x27;ve used, but hopefully you&#x27;ve been around the block enough times to have solid opinions about a couple.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for interesting challenges, we have many of them... Delivering high quality products that solve real world problems for our users, while keeping their privacy and security our primary concern, can make for surprisingly competing interests at time. We&#x27;re a very distributed team, which has many advantages, but also presents a number of challenges; it&#x27;s pretty critical that you are comfortable working independently.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in learning more, feel free to reach out to me or StavrosK (We&#x27;re josh and stavros at silentcircle.com, respectively).","time":1404220691,"type":"comment"}
