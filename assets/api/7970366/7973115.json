We&#x27;ve built a Web site (<a href=\"http://roundtown.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;roundtown.com</a>) that lists events (concerts, plays, movies, sports games, everything else) happening everywhere. We just launched in May - check it out! Our site is still an early beta, and we want to add many more features as we grow our user base this year. Our goal is nothing less than to become the top destination online for finding out what&#x27;s going on anywhere.<p>We are looking to add a couple of software engineers to our team. You should be a proficient programmer who&#x27;s enthusiastic about joining a fast-moving startup environment. We&#x27;re using Scala, Play, Slick, Postgres, Angular and Bootstrap. You should already know at least some of these technologies, or be able to learn them very quickly.  Knowledge of machine learning would be a big plus as well.<p>We&#x27;re in a cool co-working space right near Central Square. Unlike some startups, we can offer you a real salary plus early-stage stock options in our venture.<p>By the way, some things we&#x27;ll be working on in the near future include:<p>- Mobile apps for iOS and Android\n- Social event sharing\n- Crawling the Web to find more events than we have today\n- Automatic event categorization\n- Personalized event recommendations\n- Lots more polish and glitter<p>Sound like a fit? Yeehaw - send your resume to jobs@roundtown.com .","time":1404244551,"type":"comment"}
