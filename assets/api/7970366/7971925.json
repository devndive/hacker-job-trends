Cardholders can use our mobile app to handle receipt capture and expense reporting during transactions (instead of at the end of the month) or request approval for budget changes and large purchases. By issuing the cards ourselves (over the existing payment networks) we can get significantly more data and expose more control parameters than we could by linking to existing cards.<p>We recently raised our first round and are looking to make our second and third fulltime engineering hires. We&#x27;ve got interesting problems involving security, authentication, fraud detection, and user interfaces.<p>Stack includes: Python3, AWS, Ansible, AngularJS, SCSS, Redis, and PostgreSQL.<p>Email (compressed with zlib): eJxLzijKLNauyslMcshOLMrNTM5JTCrWS87PBQB&#x2F;Mwm8","time":1404233485,"type":"comment"}
