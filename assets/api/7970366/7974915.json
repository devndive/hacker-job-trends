He is 7yo and is good at Scratch but I don&#x27;t know enough about programming to get him to the next level.  Very flexible on how and when the lessons are conducted. Basically just need someone who knows how to code, likes teaching, has a fair amount of patience and has at least a general structure for teaching someone from the very beginning. And yes, his primary goal is to create an iPad app!<p>I am aware that there are many online courses, etc., but I think he&#x27;ll enjoy learning more if he has an engaging teacher.<p>If interested, please shoot me an email:  gthomps@gmail.com<p>Thanks, Geoff","time":1404270532,"type":"comment"}
