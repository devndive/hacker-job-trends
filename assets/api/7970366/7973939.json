These markets are leapfrogging conventional centralized energy generation, becoming the center of development for the distributed renewable systems that will replace it. Software for integrated metering, finance, and payments makes this development possible.<p>Angaza is hiring a software engineer to join our team in San Francisco. Your challenges may include extending and scaling our backend platform for payments and analytics; taking our HTML5+JS frontend to the next level; designing synchronization protocols for highly constrained channels; squeezing DSP code into fewer bytes than this paragraph; and traveling occasionally to field sites across the world.<p>If hired, you will become part of a small team creating a new approach to energy in emerging markets. You will receive both a salary and an equity stake in the company.
