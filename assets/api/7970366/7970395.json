Now we’re looking at interesting ways to use it to change driving. Cars of the future (and present) have onboard computers, tons of sensors, and internet connections over the cell network. If you could hook that up to our map data, you could do some really cool things.<p>To see what we’re up to, check out\n<a href=\"http://360.here.com/tag/connected-driving/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;360.here.com&#x2F;tag&#x2F;connected-driving&#x2F;</a><p>We’re looking for strong Java developers and strong testers to make this happen.
