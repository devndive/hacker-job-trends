TrueVault stores healthcare data from mobile health apps, wearable devices, and even genomic research so that our customers don’t need to spend their precious time worrying about security, performance, and scalability. More than just a database as a service, TrueVault’s proprietary technology allows us to secure our customers&#x27; data better than anyone else can (hint: think encryption and global scale slice distribution).<p>Our mission is to provide the simplest, most secure way for web apps, mobile apps, and even wearable devices to store sensitive data. Simple and secure access and storage of people’s most personal and private information is a huge challenge. That&#x27;s why we are looking for incredible people (like you perhaps?) to join us.<p>We are also hiring a Client Library Engineer and an Engineering Lead. TrueVault is in a great location and offers great compensation, benefits, and extra perks to employees.
