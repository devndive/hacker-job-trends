For this team, I am looking for smart, pragmatic developers and principal engineers who have built, operated and scaled distributed systems, and know how to design and implement APIs that will be used by 100s of 1000s of customers.  If you are into Linux, even better.  I am also looking for dev managers who know how to deliver high quality services and run a fast growing team that will ship fast and often.  We are a small team, but will be growing quickly over the next several months.  If you would like to find out more, please contact me at deesingh [AT] amazon DAWT com.","time":1404233162,"type":"comment"}
