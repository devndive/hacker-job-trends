Each week, we email our customers a question about their life, for example “What do you remember about your grandmother?” or “Tell me about the day you got engaged”. All they have to do is reply with a story, either by email or by phone. We save their stories and share them privately with their family.<p>We have a launched product with paying customers across the country who love our service. This is an opportunity to be part of the founding team that is going to help every family in the world record their story for generations to come.<p>You&#x27;re a good fit for these roles if you crave a ton of responsibility on a small team. You&#x27;ll get to define your strategy, and then you&#x27;ll actually get to execute on it. If you&#x27;re the kind of person who learns by doing, you&#x27;ll be learning faster than ever before.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in either position, I&#x27;d be happy to tell you more about each specific role. Send me a short note about yourself at nick@storyworth.com, I can&#x27;t wait to hear from you!","time":1404220285,"type":"comment"}
