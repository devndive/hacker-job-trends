Our community of around 200,000 data scientists compete to solve complex data problems.  We’re changing the way the most important data-driven problems are solved.  \nWe have branched out beyond our core business of machine learning competitions, to build end-to-end solutions in specific industries. Our first focus industry is energy, where we are working with Global 10 companies to make better decisions on where and how to drill for oil &amp; gas. Our solutions take detailed geological and engineering data and help predict well performance. These solutions can minimize capital and environmental destruction by helping operators drill fewer uneconomic wells.\nKaggle is located in the heart of the SOMA. We are well-funded (Khosla Ventures, Index Ventures and Max Levchin). Our team includes coffee, beer wine and whisky connoisseurs, pastry chefs, ping pong players, kiteboarders and rollerbladers.<p>---------- Who We&#x27;re Looking For -----------<p>-----Product Manager-----<p>We’re looking for a Product Manager with an interest in hard science and data science. Somebody who can learn a complex and technical industry and empathize with customers who are not always data science savvy. \nWhat you will be doing<p>* Create and refine the company’s product strategy\n\t* Work with our customers to understand their economics, buying process and decision making process\n\t* Develop an understanding of how Kaggle&#x27;s products impact our customer&#x27;s economics and decision making process\n\t* Collaborate with sales to develop pricing models and identify target customers\n\t* Collaborate with engineering to prioritizing requirements, scoping feature &amp; set expectations\n\t* Develop an understanding of our competition and how their impact our roadmap and positioning \n\t* Identify new opportunities based on customer interactions<p>-----Statisticians &amp; Data Scientists to Focus on the Energy Industry-----<p>-----Software Engineer-----<p>We have branched out behind our core data mining competitions, to build end-to-end solutions on an industry by industry basis. Our first industry is energy, where we&#x27;re building solutions that can transform the world&#x27;s largest industry.\nIn the energy sector, we&#x27;ve started with two basic solutions:<p>* using detailed geological data to pick the best place to lease and drill for oil &amp; gas; \n\t* using detailed data on drilling practices to help operators produce efficiently.<p>The machine learning and statistical challenges in energy have some interesting properties:<p>* geospatial data\n\t* mix of deep science and machine learning\n\t* sample sizes are small and samples are highly correlated\n\t* we care about explainability and insights<p>Addressing these challenges requires layers upon layers of statistical machine learning models\nWe want to fully capture the uncertainties in our modeling at each layer, not just the point estimates.<p>For questions, please contact us at recruiting@kaggle.com or visit our career page at <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kaggle.com&#x2F;careers</a>","time":1404429461,"type":"comment"}
