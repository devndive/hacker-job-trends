Modernizing laundry has real environmental benefits to water usage, not to mention the convenience factor of a delivery service. As humanity becomes more and more urban and less and less likely to have space for a personal washer and dryer, demand for efficient laundry service is growing.<p>Rinse needs to tackle interesting technical challenges as well. Of course, the routing problem as popularized by the Traveling Salesman Problem (except with multiple, load-balanced agents) is a challenge, but since we are also taking photos of the clothes we process, there are interesting data mining, machine learning, and image processing applications as well. This is in addition to the joys of rapidly scaling an operational system, while continually optimizing a consumer-facing product.<p>We&#x27;re looking for skilled developers of all types to join us, including Web Developers and Full-Stack Developers. Since we haven&#x27;t taken any VC yet, this is a chance to earn a significant equity stake (while still earning a competitive salary).<p>We&#x27;re a Python - Django - Heroku - AWS - Postgres -  Backbone.js - Sass - HAML - HTML5 shop currently, but since we&#x27;re small, there are opportunities to steer us technically as well.<p>More information at <a href=\"https://www.rinse.com/careers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rinse.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a> or just contact us at jobs@rinse.com","time":1404226829,"type":"comment"}
