We don&#x27;t know how to erect towers or lay fiber, but we do know how to write software people actually want to use.<p>We&#x27;re starting by building out a full set of mobile apps to replace for your carrier&#x27;s voice and SMS service and letting you port your number in. There&#x27;s a lot to build, which is why we need you.<p>We&#x27;re hiring for all engineering roles including Android, iOS and Devops. We have a particular need for engineers who know SIP&#x2F;XMPP+jingle or who have built real-time communications services before. Super-mega extra credit goes to anyone who understands WebRTC internals, and I don&#x27;t mean the JavaScript API.<p>Send me an email at andrew@bolt.co with a little info about yourself and some links to work you&#x27;ve done.","time":1404226595,"type":"comment"}
