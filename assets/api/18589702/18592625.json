We ingest written content, add sponsorship messages, turn it all into audio (voiced by real humans) and distribute it via iTunes, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri, and on the web. We&#x27;re the largest supplier of voiced content to smart speaker platforms and our clients dig it!<p>We&#x27;re looking for engineers that will help us: build better smart speaker skills &#x2F; work on dashboards &amp; customer onboarding &#x2F; metrics &amp; reporting &#x2F; tools to manage our distributed &#x27;cloud studio&#x27; of voice artists.<p>Our core services are currently written in Node.js and Python. Most apps run on AWS. Among the AWS tools and services we use: CloudFront, DynamoDB, ECS, Lambda, RDS, Redshift, SNS, SQS, CloudWatch, and S3.<p>We&#x27;d prefer candidates based in NYC because you&#x27;ll be working closely with our sales and operations teams (although we may be open to other options for the right candidate).","time":1543869093,"type":"comment"}
