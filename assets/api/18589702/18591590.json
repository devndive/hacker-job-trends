I am part of the international team based out of San Mateo (bay area). Much of our team effort is trying to make this amazing technology more accessible to the rest of the world [1], but we also just hack on TiDB.<p>Our team is oriented to being remote, and we travel periodically to meet everyone face to face.<p>Our tech stack is Go, Rust, Kubernetes, and TiDB. You can work on making an amazing serverless cloud integration or do low-level database hacking, depending on your skill set.<p>I like working on TiDB because I get to be a part of a big change going on in databases and I work with a highly-skilled team that works well together. I am constantly learning new things about databases, Kubernetes, etc, but I also get to apply my existing experience to have a big impact.<p>See the jobs page for more details and compensation.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;11&#x2F;tidb-developer-pingcap-wants-to-expand-in-north-america-after-raising-50m-series-c&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;11&#x2F;tidb-developer-pingcap-wan...</a>","time":1543862594,"type":"comment"}
