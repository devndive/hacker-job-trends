In 2014 I formed the DC Salesforce developer group and later that same year my team and I were awarded 4th place and $20,000 at the Dreamforce Hackathon.<p>Currently I&#x27;m a one man show, but now I&#x27;m looking to build out a fun, supportive team of both junior and experienced Salesforce software engineers.
