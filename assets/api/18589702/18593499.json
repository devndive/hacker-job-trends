We&#x27;re bridging global supply and demand to create independence for suppliers and value for consumers. E.g. buying handbags from Prada’s factory without the logo. Factories make more profit, buyers save money but same luxury quality. We&#x27;re a band of rebels from technology and retail, inspired by both tradition and technology, with a hellbent desire to reinvent the industry for the betterment of all, not just the few.<p>Our product team hails from well-loved brands like Calvin Klein, Armani, Patagonia, &amp; Arc&#x27;teryx. Our tech team comes from Snapchat, Shopify, Pinterest. We&#x27;re backed by top investors including Comcast, Global Founders Capital, Index, Ludlow, and the founders of Coinbase, Behance, TravelBank, &amp; Hush.<p>Very recently raised $13M Series A. Founder was Thiel fellow, YC S15, and raised big money. We’ve been covered in Vox, AdWeek, Glossy and more coming up.
