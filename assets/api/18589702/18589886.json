Our algorithms overcome the limitations of other methods, and are capable of working at an unprecedented scale of data: millions of potential links between genetic variation and thousands of human traits and diseases. We recently raised a Â£25M series B round (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genomicsplc.com&#x2F;genomics-plc-raises-series-b-round&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genomicsplc.com&#x2F;genomics-plc-raises-series-b-rou...</a>) and announced a collaboration agreement with Vertex Pharmaceuticals (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genomicsplc.com&#x2F;vertex-and-genomics-collaboration&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genomicsplc.com&#x2F;vertex-and-genomics-collaboratio...</a>).<p>We are building a team of collaborative software engineers to transform drug discovery and improve human health. We value well-crafted software and clean architecture, developed through a steady process of incremental change. Our software developers continually strive to master new technologies and techniques, and always aim to choose the right tool for the task at hand. We reserve 10% of our working week for the exploration of new ideas, and share what we have learned with each other through mentorship, pair programming, and tech talks. We work in productive partnerships with our data scientists, statisticians, and domain experts to advance our understanding of the human wiring diagram.<p>Our current openings include:<p>Senior Software Engineer - Core Engines -&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genomicsplc.com&#x2F;work-with-us&#x2F;senior-software-engineer-core-engines&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genomicsplc.com&#x2F;work-with-us&#x2F;senior-software-eng...</a><p>Software Engineer - Core Engines -&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genomicsplc.com&#x2F;work-with-us&#x2F;software-engineer-core-engines&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genomicsplc.com&#x2F;work-with-us&#x2F;software-engineer-c...</a><p>Software Engineer (Placement Year &#x2F; Internship) -&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genomicsplc.com&#x2F;work-with-us&#x2F;software-engineer-placement-year-core-engines&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genomicsplc.com&#x2F;work-with-us&#x2F;software-engineer-p...</a><p>Data Scientist -&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genomicsplc.com&#x2F;work-with-us&#x2F;data-scientist&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genomicsplc.com&#x2F;work-with-us&#x2F;data-scientist&#x2F;</a><p>IT Support Technician -&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genomicsplc.com&#x2F;work-with-us&#x2F;it-support-technician&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genomicsplc.com&#x2F;work-with-us&#x2F;it-support-technici...</a>","time":1543853752,"type":"comment"}
