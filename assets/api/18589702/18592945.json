CodeCycle works with cities throughout this crucial period to improve the energy efficiency of new and existing buildings. We are operating in six cities and steadily expanding.<p>Weâ€™re looking for someone who is comfortable designing client-side UIs for a cloud-based CAD system. Three-dimensional building data is integrated with an automated analysis of building efficiency regulations. Results of the automated analysis are delivered to municipal building inspectors on the CodeCycle iPad app.<p>Ideally, you are familiar with Clojure &amp; ClojureScript (we use re-frame), or have experience with a related functional language. We also use: Python and Objective-C and run on AWS &amp; DynamoDB.<p>We look forward to hearing from you.
