We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.<p>We&#x27;re a startup — we’ve been working on this since March 2015 and things have been going very well for us. We&#x27;ve built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.<p>We&#x27;re focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 22 states.<p>We’ve raised around $178M in VC (with a $1B valuation) and have around 240 employees. We’re looking for more talented engineers to join us.<p>Tech stack involves Ruby &#x2F; Rails and Javascript &#x2F; React Native, but we’d love to connect regardless of your experience with our stack.<p>Email us at chris.evans@joinroot.com to apply and we&#x27;ll respond to you promptly.","time":1543957899,"type":"comment"}
