We spend a good deal of time in Github so knowledge of git and gitflow would put you ahead of the crowd.<p>While this is a remote position, most of our team is on Eastern and Central timezones and we&#x27;d prefer as much overlap as possible. That said, if you are qualified, we&#x27;ll work around a couple hour&#x27;s time difference.<p>This is not a junior position, but you should still apply even if you don&#x27;t meet all the requirements.","time":1509801642,"type":"comment"}
