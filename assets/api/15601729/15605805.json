I&#x27;m the Co-Founder and Head of Product at Core Wellness, and we&#x27;re hiring :)<p>We are making meditation easy, tangible, and fun - with Hardware! Core is not a wearable, not just an app, but a physical object displayed on your nightstand or desk to serve as your daily reminder to continue your practice. Once you pick it up, Core will guide you into your meditation using a unique haptic feedback experience that pulls your mind into your physical senses.<p>After listening to the activity of your heart, Core will then show you how your meditation connects to your physical health. Over time, Core learns from your body and provides you with personalized tips + recommendations on how to grow your practice and truly master meditation.<p>We&#x27;re a small team of 4 now but growing to at least 8 over the next few months, so get in now!<p>Roles:\n- Senior, Generalist Software Leader  \n- iOS Developer  \n- Embedded Systems Engineer<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.corewellness.io&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.corewellness.io&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a>","time":1509573017,"type":"comment"}
