Managing this growing complexity with Excel spreadsheets and emails has reached its limit and it&#x27;s showing, for example, in cost and schedule overruns.<p>Valispace overcomes this by harnessing the power of web technologies: We are building a browser-based data storage and collaboration software and API. Our ambition is to become the GitHub of hardware engineering: allowing engineers and designers worldwide to work together in a streamlined way, much as git has enabled efficient collaboration on software.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.valispace.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.valispace.com</a> - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;valispace&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;210070-web-developer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;valispace&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;210070-web-developer</a>","time":1509554531,"type":"comment"}
