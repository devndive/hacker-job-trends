We&#x27;re just getting started, so we haven&#x27;t landed all of the decisions yet on the stack. Expect React (web&#x2F;native) for the front end, and a JS or python framework on the back end - with microservices to  handle the more advanced stuff.<p>This is a unique opportunity to help us define the vision, the tech stack, and even the way of working and culture.  We are hoping to do some amazing things, and need a lot of help to do it!<p>Our careers page is at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;yara.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;vacant_positions&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;yara.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;vacant_positions&#x2F;</a> (just search for developer) - if you&#x27;re interested and  don&#x27;t see a role that fits precisely, just apply for one of the roles anyway, and leave a note in the cover letter!
