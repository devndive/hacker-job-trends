It&#x27;s a rapidly growing company with a really clear focus; working only in the front-end with JavaScript to build web&#x2F;mobile apps for clients. The office has about 180 staff based in downtown Toronto, some work remotely.<p>The projects are varied and interesting - there&#x27;s an extremely strong emphasis on clean code, testable user stories, and helping clients build better products.<p>A lot of our recent projects have been in React, but there still are a number of Angular and Node projects as well.<p>The staff here seem to <i>actually</i> care about work-life balance here (unlike many of the companies I previously worked for). Also, there are some absolutely brilliant engineers, salespeople, designers, and more here - everyone is very warm and supportive.<p>Feel free to reach out if you want to chat, my email is notworkingveryhard@gmail.com<p>Open positions:<p><pre><code>  - JavaScript (or front-end) Developer\n  - Business&#x2F;Quality Analyst\n  - Solutions Architect\n  - Product Designer\n  - Product Manager\n  - Scrum Master\n  - and more...</code></pre>","time":1509566792,"type":"comment"}
