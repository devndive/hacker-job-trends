We provide data analytics as a service by leveraging our AI-powered tools and in-house analyst team.<p>We integrate with customers&#x27; data sources in a few minutes. Users interact with our product in plain English as if they are talking to a human analyst. We generate detailed answers, reports, and insights for them with our AI assisted analyst team. Our main differentiator from traditional chatbots is we make sure our customers get the answers they need as long as we have access to the relevant data.<p>Our stack consists of Python, Django, React, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes and we are hosting on GCP.\nFrom a technical perspective, we are looking for senior full-stack engineers who are comfortable building a scalable system ground up. Familiarity with a few of these systems above is desirable. From a cultural point of view, we would like to work with builders who are eager to learn and jump into any task that needs to be done. This could vary from data engineering to frontend development to building natural language understanding flows and conversational interfaces. We are at a very early stage, so you&#x27;ll have a huge impact in the technology as well as the culture. Currently, we already have a working product with several pilot customers. We will be integrating with new data sources in the next few months.<p>Feel free to email me at ertan@soru.ai.","time":1509571593,"type":"comment"}
