Do you like the idea of Clojure but don&#x27;t know it? Don&#x27;t worry, we will provide you with the necessary training as long as you have the right attitude and an appetite for learning.<p>At Baresquare we take an active interest in good development practices. We do extensive automated testing for the codebase, in the form of unit tests, but also with integration and generative tests. We use the full power of Git with branches to ensure the stability of the code and to introduce new features and fixes in a controlled manner. We avoid the &quot;works on my machine&quot; syndrome by using Docker for all the components of our applications to allow our developers to replicate the production environment locally. This also means that on-boarding new developers is quick and painless. Most importantly, Baresquare promotes an environment of learning so if you are unfamiliar with our practices, we will be very happy to help you come up to speed with pair programming sessions, advice and mentoring.<p>Clojure is a central technology choice for Baresquare because of its great affinity with data processing tasks and its versatility which allows us to iterate quickly over features and improvements.<p>Technologies now: Clojure, PostgreSQL, R, Docker, AWS (ECS, Lambda, S3), Terraform, Unit&#x2F;Integration&#x2F;Generative testing, Continuous integration<p>Future: Elastic, Logstash, Kibana, Onyx, Apache Spark<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.baresquare.com&#x2F;contact&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.baresquare.com&#x2F;contact&#x2F;</a>","time":1509577952,"type":"comment"}
