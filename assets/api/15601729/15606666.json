We provide APIs and backend services that enable persistent and multi-user AR experiences, so developers don&#x27;t have to worry about AR data or session management. We are connecting AR worlds and bringing them to the real world.<p>We are a group of interesting and unique people solving some of the hardest problems in AR. These extend beyond the scope of Stack Overflow questions â€“ and we love it. We are fairly small at the moment, so you&#x27;ll have a chance to play an important role to shape our culture and product.<p>We work at the bleeding edge of technology. We tackle everything from highly performant computer vision algorithms on mobile devices to reliable and fast cloud services that manage AR data and sessions<p>Our stack:<p>- Core algorithms in C++ cross-compiled for Android, iOS, and Unity, so we also do work in Objective-C, Swift, Java, and C#<p>- Our backend is in Java, C++, ZeroMQ, Redis, Cassandra deployed on AWS.<p>If you are interested e-mail us: jobs@escherreality.com and tell us about yourself and side projects you&#x27;ve worked on.","time":1509580911,"type":"comment"}
