Our model achieves real learning: small class sizes, expert instructors, excellent materials, and lots of practical, hands-on lab exercises that leave the students really knowing their material and being able to use it.\nCustomers say it&#x27;s the best training they&#x27;ve ever had, from anybody, on anything.\nI&#x27;m partnered with GitLab, Docker, and am a member of the AWS partner network.\nLooking for an independent sales agent. Progressive commission structure (the more you sell, the more you make!)\nRemote and part-time OK.\nEmail me at: aleksey@verticalsysadmin.com","time":1509769997,"type":"comment"}
