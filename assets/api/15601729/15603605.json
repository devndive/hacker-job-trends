We are using Git and our CI&#x2F;CD tool of choice is Drone.<p>Our tech stack is Ruby on Rails (Backend), PostgreSQL and Redis. Our mobile app is Android based and written in Kotlin, we also have one external service that is written in Java, but as our frontend engineer you will have nothing to do with it ;-)<p>We have not yet decided on how we will proceed with our frontend, currently it&#x27;s simply Rails views with some plain javascript and jQuery.
