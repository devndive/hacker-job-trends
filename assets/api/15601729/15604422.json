Just as Amazon started with books, we&#x27;re starting with billboards. Ultimately we want every marketer to use AdQuick to advertise across many different verticals (billboards, buses, Google, Reddit, ESPN, etc).<p>We&#x27;re funded by Initialized Capital (Garry Tan &amp; Alexis Ohanian&#x27;s fund). Our customers include Lyft, Instacart, Peloton and more. Customers spend $200K+. We&#x27;re a team of 7 and were profitable last month. Founders (including I) are ex-Instacart, half of which are technical. We&#x27;re growing very quickly. Jump on board!<p>Our stack is Rails, React, Postgres on Heroku. Lots of challenges scaling frontend map interface, backend ROI data calc, and more. We use image recognition to find social posts of billboards. Building an e-commerce platform to buy advertising is a challenge on it&#x27;s own.<p>My email is fahim@adquick.com. Shoot me a message to learn more.","time":1509562699,"type":"comment"}
