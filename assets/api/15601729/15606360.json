We&#x27;re currently solving the problem of reporting, where retailers are crippled by old systems and bad data models. We give them a reporting dashboard that gives them any metric, over any timerange and dimension, instantly. So, instead of spending a bunch of time making reports, they can just focus on the analysis. Store managers to CEOs at large international retail brands are using our software every day to make real-time decisions based on facts and data. Adoption of our software is growing rapidly, so we&#x27;re looking to expand our engineering team.<p>Our team is small, tight-knit and efficient. We&#x27;re passionate about helping our customers, and building most loved tool in retail. As an engineer at 42, you can expect to work on many areas of the stack, and you&#x27;ll have a high degree of autonomy. You&#x27;ll also own your projects and talk directly to customers, blowing their minds with the stuff you&#x27;ll release. You don&#x27;t need to have retail experience but you should have 3+ years of professional engineering experience, and be very familiar with Python and&#x2F;or Javascript, and SQL.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, send your resume&#x2F;portfolio&#x2F;github&#x2F;etc to nick@42technologies.com","time":1509578002,"type":"comment"}
