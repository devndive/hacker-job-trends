We let you connect to your database(s), query your data, visualize and share it (dashboards, API, etc). Redash is fully open source [2] with a SaaS offering.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone to redesign the application. The goal is to create a style guide we can apply to the application. Preferably someone who is a &quot;full stack&quot; designer, i.e. can do both the design and also write CSS. Collaboration will be via GitHub and all the work will be open source. Great opportunity to explore how design&#x2F;UX work in an open source project can be done.<p>This is a scoped project (paid of course), although we would love the person who takes this to be able to help us from time to time when we add new UI or when UX questions arise. Maybe in the future this can become a full time position.<p>Email arik at redash.io to apply.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redash.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redash.io</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;getredash&#x2F;redash\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;getredash&#x2F;redash</a>","time":1509553636,"type":"comment"}
