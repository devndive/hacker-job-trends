We are a team of experts in deep\nlearning, machine vision, and software engineering.<p>We&#x27;re located in Seattle, WA by Gas Works Park (10 minutes away from the University of Washington). We&#x27;re\na small team seeking to double our size. We spun-off as a separate entity from\nthe Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in February 2017 raising a 2.6M\nseed.<p>We&#x27;re hiring for three engineering positions: C++, Machine Learning, and\nComputer Vision at all levels (e.g., junior, senior, principal). In general,\nour C++ engineers work on the systems &amp; architecture side, and our ML&#x2F;Vision\nengineers develop new techniques and algorithms. Both teams work directly with\nour customers to develop end-to-end solutions from data acquisition, scrubbing,\ntraining, and deployment. Our C++ engineers work closely with our ML&#x2F;Vision\nengineers to build a bespoke deep learning platform uniquely suited for edge\ndevices.<p>We work on a gamut of platforms from x86 server platforms, GPUs, FPGAs, all the\nway to ARM-based platforms like the Raspberry Pi.<p>Send an e-mail to carlo@xnor.ai with a resume and a quick paragraph.","time":1509603427,"type":"comment"}
