By being at the core of business to business communication, scheduling, and contacts, we believe we can shape the future of how people work.<p>We’re hiring senior engineers to help us scale and build new products on top of our APIs. Right now our open-source Python-based sync engine regularly archives terabytes of data across a massive SQL cluster, and our APIs handle tens of millions of requests a day. We aim to scale that several times over in the next year.<p>Our team (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nylas.com&#x2F;team&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nylas.com&#x2F;team&#x2F;</a>) is roughly equal by identified gender (including engineering) and is comprised of startup founders; Debian contributors; {{Large Tech Corp®}} alums; MIT, Columbia, Yale, CMU, Olin, alums; and a professional dancer from the San Francisco Ballet. We actively and regularly work with the entire team to shape our culture to our ideal of honesty, transparency, individual empowerment, and kindness.<p>You must have a growth mindset, have enough engineering experience to architect complex systems, have a track record of managing your own projects, have a strong sense of practical shippability over engineering purity, have a natural tendency towards humbleness in your own abilities, and have an innate desire to pass that knowledge onwards.<p>Email evan@nylas.com directly if interested!","time":1509557663,"type":"comment"}
