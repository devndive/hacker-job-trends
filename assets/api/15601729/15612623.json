In the meantime, 99% of what determines our health happens outside of them. Lab79 is looking to change that, by reimagining how we experience healthcare, with a particular emphasis on our most vulnerable populations. If you are looking to make a real difference in people&#x27;s lives and work on an exciting future for healthcare, you&#x27;ll love the work we&#x27;re doing.<p>You are a full-stack Clojure&#x2F;script engineer with at least two years of experience in Clojure. Our current stack is Clojure, Datomic, and Om Next on top of Kubernetes. Our engineering team is distributed, and we are looking to add one more engineer to the team in the next 2 months. If you&#x27;d like to learn more, we&#x27;d love to hear from you at careers@lab79.org.","time":1509645399,"type":"comment"}
