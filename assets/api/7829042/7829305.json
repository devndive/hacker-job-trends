Change the world. Have fun. Do something important.<p>Smarterer gives people unprecedented understanding of what they know and what their teams and organizations know.<p>We are looking for creative web programmers, developers and hackers to join our product team. Ideally you are a versatile technologist who loves to build web products, especially (but not exclusively) if you have Python experience. Our stack is primarily Python, SqlAlchemy, and JavaScript with some Backbone and CoffeeScript mixed in.<p>Smarterer is doing something unique and important. We&#x27;re approaching a point where traditional university credentialing isn&#x27;t enough. Skills are changing too quickly and what makes someone effective in a role or job is evolving. New roles appear daily that no (or few) traditional universities have courses for. People are acquiring more and more skills through non-traditional means. Companies are finding it increasingly difficult to close the &quot;skills gap&quot;.<p>How do you show what you know?<p>Smarterer has created an innovative, machine learning, crowd-sourced testing system that will disrupt how people think about skills. Donâ€™t let our name fool you, while our system is fun, our unique, patent-pending, technology is also deeply rooted in scientific modern testing theory.<p>Smarterer is enabling a revolution: in how the enterprise manages their teams and talent, in the changing job marketplace, and in the way people measure their own skills and share that knowledge.<p>We&#x27;re funded by Google Ventures, True Ventures, Re-think education, Boston Seed as well as some amazing angel investors.<p>Interested?
