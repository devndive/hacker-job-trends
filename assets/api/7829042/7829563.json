We&#x27;re looking for someone to be a key member of the development team - so experience (or the ability to learn quickly) and attention to detail are massively important.<p>We&#x27;re moving from a single-repo PHP legacy application towards a client-service, multi-repo application codebase. To do that we&#x27;ll be slicing off features from the PHP legacy app and re-writing them into front-end, client applications, in Node.js.<p>TeachBoost is a performance management platform for education; we help educators improve by streamlining and improving the coaching&#x2F;evaluation process, and using that data to better inform educator development&#x2F;training. We&#x27;re a growing team of passionate, mission driven people - and looking for more of the same!<p>Get in touch with jason AT teachboost.com if you&#x27;re interested!","time":1401637927,"type":"comment"}
