We currently operate in the Los Angeles area but plan to scale to other popular metropolitan areas of the country soon. Our goal is to make it easy for anyone to maintain their home by letting Upkeep handle their cleaning, gardening, pool service, home repair, or any other home service related issue. We are looking for a senior Ruby on Rails engineer to help us scale our operations and backend. If working at a full-stack startup interests you, do yourself a favor and apply! We make heavy use of Slack and Trello when it comes to communicating with our distributed workforce.<p>Contact me at james[at]tryupkeep[dot]com","time":1401653425,"type":"comment"}
