Both Claus and Trae have deep enteprise experience, and an intense desire to bring a game-changing platform to the market. We&#x27;ve been lucky to hire some super-talented engineers and designers. Thus, our team is a great group of people to work with. It&#x27;s small right now, so we&#x27;re being highly selective about the people we are bringing on board.<p>This company is going to go places. This is my third startup, and I&#x27;ve never seen so much interest in a pre-launch company. Every time we demo to customers, potential partners and investors, they are amazed.<p>Our seed investor, Randall Kaplan (co-founder of Akamai), is also very well-connected in the enterprise market.","time":1401644876,"type":"comment"}
