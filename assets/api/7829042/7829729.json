We&#x27;ll pay for relocation.<p>We&#x27;re hiring software and production engineers of all skill levels.<p>Braintree makes awesome payments APIs for developers.

Have you ever been on call for an application that makes $29,000 a minute?<p>* Building SDKs that make payments on mobile devices easy and frictionless, both for developers and consumers.<p>* Build abstractions that make accepting payments, in all their crazy varieties, easy all over the world -- not just in the US.<p>You can read more at <a href=\"https://braintreepayments.com/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;braintreepayments.com&#x2F;careers</a> or email me at lionel.barrow@getbraintree.com.","time":1401640131,"type":"comment"}
