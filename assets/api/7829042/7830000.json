H1B VISA Transfer ok for the right candidate.  TN VISA ok. REMOTE considered for the perfect  candidate.<p>Mobile networks are different. And yet we continue using the same <i>legacy</i> protocol stack (TCP&#x2F;HTTP&#x2F;SSL) to connect mobile devices to  the cloud. Does that <i>frustrate</i> you? Are you not afraid of opening a socket and send a few UDP packets when you need to? Then we&#x27;re looking for you.<p>Packetzoom is rethinking the whole stack from the ground up. You get to hack network and&#x2F;or security protocols, innards of mobile operating systems and build a global distributed system around brand new protocols.
