In just 8 months after launch, we’re in more than 1.5% of US schools, and are growing rapidly. We solve the hard problem of computing large amounts of student data and presenting it to teachers in a way that they can use it to personalize instruction for each student.<p>We’re looking for engineers who have functional programming experience, or are really excited about functional programming to work on our product built in Clojure, Haskell, and JS.<p>We’re looking for the first engineers (after the CTO) to join the team and have immense impact on our success and our culture. Given this high level of responsibility, we offer a generous amount of equity. Finally, everyone at Front Row has a ton of flexibility in where they work, and what they work on.<p>Email jobs@frontrowed.com if you’re interested, or learn more here: <a href=\"http://goo.gl/dY8gqB\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;dY8gqB</a>","time":1401636777,"type":"comment"}
