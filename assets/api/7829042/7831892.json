We have 10 employees and 4 of us are full-time devs. We work in whatever tools are productive and pleasant to use (historically we&#x27;ve used Python, Node, Clojure on the backend, and we&#x27;re just figuring out how to make good use of the new-hawtness frontend tools like Knockout&#x2F;React&#x2F;etc.). We&#x27;re not afraid of experimenting with new stuff, but we tend to favor tried and true solutions, so working with Django, Postgres, and JQuery should not make you want to claw your eyes out.<p>We&#x27;re looking for both backend and frontend developers who are willing to relocate to a family-friendly college town in the Midwest. We have a wide tolerance for your experience level, PLEASE get in touch if you&#x27;re interested. (don@mirusresearch.com)<p>We have a lot of the startup-style environment (chef-prepped lunch once a week, massage therapist once a month, couches, ping-pong, macbooks, trendy office, etc.) without the stress of worrying whether you&#x27;ll be on the streets in a month. Also, we&#x27;re not a frat house, so if the keg-in-the-office or brogrammer scenes aren&#x27;t really your thing, you won&#x27;t have to worry about that here.<p>Unfortunately, at the present time we are only able to hire folks who are legally able to work in the US.<p>Email me: don@mirusresearch.com","time":1401683371,"type":"comment"}
